consciousness its relationship to the unconscious ps yche and its functions ar e discussed psychology is 
said to be a science of consciousness and of th e products of the unconscious psyche which can be 
explored only in terms of its cons cious manifestations cons ciousness itself is in termittent and narrow 
and is a product of perception and orientation to the external world depending on reference to an ego

jung c collected works of c g jung vol  princeton university pr ess   p p   
in a  lecture at the institute of medical ps ychology tavistock clinic in london unconscious 
processes of the mind and means of access to them ar e discussed it is empha sized that unconscious 
processes cannot be observed directly but only th rough their products that enter consciousness 
unconscious processes that cross the threshold of consciousness are divi ded into the personal 
unconscious comprised of material of an individual origin and the collective unconscious comprised o f 
archetypes of mythological character that belong to  all of mankind reflect the history of the human 
brain and can become active in social groups a diagra m of the structure of the psyche in terms of these 
and related concepts is provided three methods of approaching the unconscious  word association 
tests dream analysis and active imagination  are suggested and th e word association test which 
depends on delays and errors in producing verbal asso ciations to words is de scribed in detail with 
examples from case histories in open discussion following the l ecture the unconscious is further 
defined and related to freudian theory and the word associati on test is further explained

discussed as a source of information in psychotherapeu tic treatment with referen ce to a specific clinical 
case after preliminary words on complexes defined as  agglomerations of asso ciations that are like 
fragmentary personalities and on the use of word association tests in fa mily research the clinical case is 
presented in contrast with freudian dream analysis dreams are seen not as di storted representations of 
censored incompatible wishes but as manifesta tions of what the unconscious is doing with the 
complexes in contrast with fre uds technique of free association the process of am plification is 
employed to discover the context of the dream content  special explanation is offered of the hero motif 
dragon motif and the wand as mythological symbols appearing in dreams open discussion of dreams

in a  lecture at the institute of medical psychol ogy tavistock clinic in london archetypal images 
in dreams are explored dreams containing such images indicate that the dreamers psychological 
situation extends beyond the personal portion of the unc onscious and relates to the universal problems o f 
mankind examples of dreams with universal motif s from mythological and biblical sources are 
examined and it is asserted that those dreams like al l others are indications that  the individual is acting 
at variance with unconscious conditions a specific dream with mythological content is presented and 
such symbols as the serpent the cave water treas ure the dagger and the city are analyzed in open 
discussion following the lecture th e similarities and differences betwee n the present approach and that 
of freud are explained

and treatment of transference are ex amined transference is described as a specific form of projection in 
which subjective contents are unconsciously ex tended to another person types and etiology of

 symbols and the interpre tation of dreams  the significance of dreams  in jung c 
collected works of c g jung vol  prince ton university press   p p   
in a portion of an essay written in  the significan ce of dreams is said to be that symbols are 
unconsciously and spontaneously produced in dreams  allowing the investigation of the unconscious 
aspects of conscious psychic events dreams are the universally accessible and most common source for 
the investigation of mans symboliz ing faculty and are the chief sour ce of knowledge about symbolism 
in analyzing dreams only the material that is clea rly and visibly indicated as  belonging to the dream by 
the dream images themselves should be used free association as practiced by freud may not produce a 
correct interpretation the beliefs of primitive tribe members regarding dreams are compared to those of 
modems and it is suggested that human consciousness because it is relatively new historically is 
discontinuous and resists the unknown parts of the ps yche even in members of modern society  
 symbols and the interpreta tion of dreams  the functions of the unconscious in jung c 
collected works of c g jung vol  prince ton university press   p p    
in a portion of an essay written in  various f unctions of the unconscious are described as an 
example of the subliminal materi al on which spontaneous production of dream symbols is based the 
unconscious is a repository of tem porarily eclipsed contents that c ontinue to influence conscious 
processes a barely audible sound will be perceived alternately as audible and inaudible depending on 
the attention being paid to it for example physical  stimuli in an hysteric al patient may produce the 
effect of anesthesia contents can also arise out  of unconsciousness as when subliminal sense 
perception affects behavior or wh en an unconscious recollection enters a creative work due to 
cryptomnesia it is h ypothesized that material becomes unconsci ous because conscious contents must 
lose their energy the attention given to them or thei r specific emotional tone in  order to make room for 
new contents a distinction is made  between intentional contents deri ved from the egopersonality and 
unintentional contents from a sour ce not identical with the ego  
 symbols and the interpretation of dreams  the language of dreams  in jung c 
collected works of c g jung vol  prince ton university press   p p   
in a portion of an essay written in  the analysis of  dreams is examined in terms of the images and 
symbols that appear in them many dreams presen t images and associations that are analogous to 
primitive ideas myths and rites freuds  archai c remnants yet these elements are functional and 
serve as a bridge between conscious means of expr ession and more primitive pictorial means dreams 
arc attempts to reestablish psychi c equilibrium by restoring images a nd emotions that express the state 
of the unconscious typical dream motifs are mentioned and several dr eams are recounted and 
analyzed one of jungs dreams is analyzed by freud and jung himself  the two psychoanalysts disagree 
in the dream analysis  
 symbols and the interpreta tion of dreams  the problem of types in dream 
interpretation  in jung c collected works of c g j ung vol  princeton university press  
 p p   
in a portion of an essay written in  describing th e method of and approach to understanding dreams 
as the main source of natural symbols the importance of personality types  in troverted and extraverted 
 is explained the difference between  the extravert who is concerned with externals and the introvert 
who is concerned mainly with the wa y he takes a situation plays a great role in the analysis of dreams 
no therapeutic technique is uniformly applicable to a ll patients since every case  is an individual in a 
specific condition examples are give n to illustrate that the interp retation of dreams and symbols 
depends largely on the dispositi on of the dreamer for symbols ma y have several meanings even 
opposite ones for different patients  
 symbols and the interpreta tion of dreams s the archetype in dream symbolism  in jung 
c collected works of c g jung vol  pr inceton university press   p p   
in a portion of an essay written in  the archetype   an inherited tendenc y of the human mind to 
form representations of mythological motifs  is ex amined in terms of its primary importance in dream 
interpretation the symbolism in dreams and other phe nomena that occur in dr eams are not of individual 
origin but derive from innate patterns of the hum an mind examples of dreams with religious and 
mythological symbolism are given and a contrast is  developed between primitives who live their 
symbols and the modems who reflec t on them because the modern mind is said to be dissociated and 
confused it is concluded that the past as well as the present must be unde rstood in order to gain 
perspective on the powers that operate outside the r ealm of free will an understanding of myths and 
symbols is essential in this regard  
 symbols and the interpreta tion of dreams  the func tion of religious symbols  in jung 
c collected works of c g jung vol  pr inceton university press   p p   
in the context of a discussion on symbols and the in terpretation of dreams written in essay form in 
 it is pointed out that religiou s symbols although they represent beliefs that cannot be proved give 
meaning to mans life and help him find his place in the universe it is pointed out that many persons 
have lost faith in religion and ask psychiatrists questions that were on ce reserved for theologians such 
symbols as the golden a ge godman the cross and the hindu lin gam are discussed and the im portance 
of imagination and intuition in the interpreta tion of dreams and symbols is emphasized  
 symbols and the interpretation of dreams  healing the split  in jung c collected works 
of c g jung vol  princeton univ ersity press   p p   
in a portion of an essay written in  the loss of mo ral and spiritual values in the modern world and 
the function of dreams in bringing numinous or spiritual symbols into consciousness from the 
unconscious are discussed the emotional energy th at is attached to numinous phenomena does not 
cease to exist when it disappears from consciousness  but reappears in unconscious manifestations in 
symbolic happenings that compensate for disturba nces of the conscious psyche although man finds 
that neither his religions nor his phi losophies provide powerful ideas to gi ve him security he forgets that 
god speaks chiefly through dreams and visions the importance of assimilating and integrating the 
conscious and unconsci ous is emphasized  
 the symbolic life  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  princeton university 
press   p p   
a seminar talk to the guild of pastoral ps ychology london  is presented which answers two 
questions on why believing roman ca tholics are seldom subject to ne urosis it is suggested that 
catholics do become neurotic but seek the help of priests instead of doctors it is also suggested 
however that the small number of complex manifestat ions in catholics may be due to the churchs 
attention to the symbolic life that all men need th e confession the fatherconf essor the mass and other 
sacraments embody the mystery that reaches back into the history of  the human mind in answer to a 
second question the need and place of god in the ps yche are demonstrated fr om clinical cases and 
uncertainty is expressed regarding the historical futu re of religion discussion follows concerning ritual 
symbolism neuroses among protesta nts and other topics relating to  religion and mental health

 princeton university pres s   p p   
in a  lecture an historical overview of spirit ualistic phenomena  animal magnetism clairvoyance 
prophecy visions  is presented a nd personal experiences with medium s are discussed spiritualism has 
a dual nature  a theoretical scientific side and  a religious side thus touching on two different areas 
of human experience personal experiences with me diums produced demonstrations of table turning 
automatic writing and speaking in a trance and the resemblance of some phenomena to symptoms of 
emotional disturbances is noted it  is concluded that spiritualistic  phenomena are difficult to understand 
and that their reality is in quest ion although by no means disproven  
 on occultism foreword to jun g occult phenomena on o ccultism foreword to jun g 
phenomenes occultes  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  princeton university 
press   p p   
in the foreword to phenomenes occultes by c g  jung  occult phenomena particularly the 
question of the souls existence after death are examined the essays in the book are described as 
dealing with the idea of immortali ty and its functional value not with the metaphysical question of 
immortality the idea of immortality exists worldwide and is therefore r eal  a characteristic of psychic 
life it is argued that for reasons of psychic hygiene it is best not to forget such universal ideas and if 
they have disappeared from neglect or intellectual disfavor they shoul d be reconstructe d as quickly as 
possible re gardless of alle ged philoso phical  proofs for or a gainst their existence  
 on occultism psychology and spiritualism  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol 
 princeton university pres s   p p   
in a foreword to the unobstructed universe by st ewart edward white  spiritualism and spirits 
are discussed in terms of their relationship to the unconscious mi nd and parallels with psychology are 
suggested spirits it is argued appear to be psychic phenomena whose origins lie in the unconscious 
they are shadowy personifications of unconscious contents conformi ng to the rule that activated 
portions of the unconscious assume  the character of personalities when perceived by the conscious 
mind in spiritualism therefore communications of  spirits are statements about the unconscious 
spiritualism as described in whites book is comp ared with aspects of m odem psychology andit is 
concluded that one aim of both is to compensate the narrowness of the conscious mind by deepening its 
knowledge of the unconscious

in the foreword to a book on parapsychologi cal experiences spuk irrglaube oder 
wairrglaube ghost false belief or true by fanny moser  prejudice against belief in 
parapsychology is said to be grounded in an ar chaic unconscious fear of ghosts and a personal 
experience of ghost like phenomena is  recounted it is argued that rationalism and superstition are 
complementary and that the more  rationalistic one becomes in hi s conscious mind the more alive 
becomes the world of the unconscious parapsychological phenomena are of interest to the psychologist 
because they provide information about the exteriori zation of unconscious processes their content and 
the possible sources of such phenomena the persona l experience is analyzed  in terms of possible 
perceptions and reconstructions of the unconscious  
 on occultism foreword to jaffe  apparitions and precognition  in jung c collected 
works of c g jung vol  princeton university press   p p

tales warning visions and othe r strange happenings are frequently  reported in the form of ghost 
stories and other superstitious happenings the book re gards such experiences as  psychic facts and asks 
such psychological questions as wh o sees ghosts under what conditi ons and what a specific ghost 
symbolizes it is coneluded that the psychol ogy of the unconscious has shed light on many 
parapsychological questions and it can be expected to do likewise in the area of wonder tales

g jung vol  princeton univers ity press   p p   
reflections are offered on the dual pe rsonality of the criminal who is  tom between respectability and 
crime and on the fact that crime seems to appear to  the criminal as somethi ng foreign that gains a hold 
on him so that eventually he has no knowledge of what he is about to do cases are presented to 
illustrate the personification of the cr iminal instinct and the transfer of  evil instincts from one person to a 
second who then unconsciously commits a crime that he would otherwise not have committed in the 
case of the transmission of evil ins tincts it is pointed out that the more  evil a person is the more he tries 
to force on others the wickedness he do es not want to show in himself

the case of a transvestite the ethi cality of the operation is upheld on grounds  that it was not illegal that

transsexual operation which involved castration may violate collective emotions about a collective 
taboo and may be hazardous to the me dical profession for that reason

 freud and psychoanalysis a comment  on tausks criticism of nelken  in jung c 
collected works of c g jung vol  prince ton university press   p p   
a review by victor tausk of an article by jan ne lken  is criticized  for misinterpreting the 
significance of symbols in schizophr enic fantasy the symbols rats and mice cloacal animals gnawing 
at the genitals castrati on are said by tausk to represent the in fantile defecation anal complex the 
response is that reduction of fantas ies to infantile mechanisms is not enough the therapist must ask why 
certain infantile channels of interest are being reacti vated in the present and find out what they mean to 
the patient even if infantile or primitive symbols are appr oached analytically the zurich school is not 
content with reduction and with es tablishing their selfevident exis tence rather by comparing them 
through similar material this school tries to reconstruct the actual pr oblems that led to the employment 
of these primitive pa tterns and seeks expression through them in th e case at issue it is argued that the 
teleological significance of the castration mo tif in the fantasy must be clarified  
 freud and psychoanalysis answers to questions on freud  in jung c collected works of

psyche and  the value of freuds therapeutic pro cedure freud is criticized for overemphasis of sex 
yet his contribution to knowledge of th e psyche is praised the character and attitude of the therapist are

adaptation individuation co llectivity and their interrelationships are explained in pa pers written in 
 psychological adaptation is said to involve ad aptation to inner and outer conditions and its 
energetics are described in analysis a resistance of ten arises from the demand for individuation which 
is against all adaptation to others since breaking th e patients previous personal conformity would mean 
the destruction of an esthetic and moral ideal how ever the first step in i ndividuation is guilt which 
requires that expiation be offered to a new coll ective function namely humanity in return for 
individuation a person must bring forth values that are an equivale nt substitute for his absence in the 
collective personal sphere individuati on and collectivity are further discussed in relation to society the

on transference is singled out for discussion the problem  of transference is said to occupy a central 
position in the dialectical process of analytical psychology making gr eat demands on the doctors skill 
and moral responsibility transference forcibly brin gs about a dialogue that requires both patient and 
analyst to acknowledge their partnership in a comm on process of approximation and differentiation as 
the patient frees himself of his infantile state of unconsciousness or from unbounded egocentricity the 
analyst must allow himself to display a degree of humanity that the patient needs in order to assure 
himself of his ri ght to exist as an individual

archetype is amplified it is difficul t to prove that the amplificatory a ssociations are not causal yet they 
may represent cases of synchronicity  instead it is possible that the psyche analogous to the natural 
course of events is based on synchr onicity as contrasted with scientif ic reconstructions of reality based 
on statistical averages doubt is expressed however  that the psyche is based exclusively on the

phenomenology presents difficult probl ems as the book shows it is concluded that no simplification of

beelden uit het onbewuste pictures from th e unconscious by r j van helsdingen  is 
described as a discussion of a case treated by jung hi mself with the use of drawings by the patient the 
patient had lived in both the orie nt and europe as a child and a dolescent and these environments 
combined with her inner disposition to produce a series  of pictures expressing an infantile archaic fear 
the pictures not only illustrated the phase of treatment that brought the c ontents of the patients neurosis 
to consciousness but were also an instrument of tr eatment reducing the half conscious or unconscious 
images in her mind to a common denominator and fixa ting them it is explained that the therapeutic 
effect consists of inducing the c onscious and unconscious minds to co llaborate thus integrating the 
unconscious and remedying the neurotic dissociation

between the archetype and the symbol complexes ar e described as autonomous forcing themselves on 
consciousness or resisting conscious ef forts to reproduce them they give rise to such actions as slips of 
the tongue and falsificati ons of memory and judgment comple xes rest on emotional aptitudes or

in a foreword to human relationships by eleanor be rtine swiss edition  it is noted that freud 
and adler drew conclusions on the basi s of neurotic patients and tried to  apply them to society whereas 
analytical psychology has pointed out  more general human facts such as attitude and function types 
that play a role in neurosis but are also a norma l part of the human constitution although freud put the 
oedipus complex in a central place in his theory it is  argued that other typical patterns archetypes also 
exist and regulate the relationships among human beings examples abound in mythology folklore 
dreams and psychoses and exert a deci sive effect on huma n relationships

 in a foreword to psyche and symbol by violet s  de laszlo  the historical basis of psychic 
processes is discussed like other sciences psychology must take account of the past specifically the 
history of the psyche dreams or fantasies that appear  psychotic may be well within the range of normal 
human experience as validated by historical comparison the mind like the body has predetermined 
individual aptitudes or pa tterns of behavior and man will to a certain extent f unction psychologically 
according to his original patterns archetypes represen t these inherited patterns of psychic behavior and 
their significance is summarized

die anima als schicksalsproblem de s mannes the anima as a problem in the mans fate by cornelia 
brunner  is described in a foreword as a record  of an eightyear dialogue in which the partners 
recorded both their conscious and unconscious reacti ons although the technique appears unscientific it 
is defended as a guarantee of psychol ogical objectivity because it repr esents what happens in reality 
the main subject of the dialogue was the question of the anima  the feminine element in the male 
personality rider haggard is cited as the classic e xponent of the anima and his creative writing is 
recommended as a good introduction to brunners book it is concluded th at the dialectical process is

not understand what one wants of hi m and cannot look into his own t houghts or retell hallucinations or 
dreams the negro is religious and pictures the white man as an ideal in dream examples the wish or 
task to adapt to the white man appears frequently and many sacrificial symbols appear the latter fact 
is cited as evidence that such symbols are not onl y christian but have their origin in a biological 
necessity

in older chinese and later tantric philosophy it is su ggested as a working hypothe sis that such parallels

africa the psychic life of primi tives was studied to unearth the el ements primitives have in common 
with europeans processes that are in the unconsci ous of europeans are conscious to primitives for

psychology that would be helpful to the task did not exist before freuds totem  and taboo is cited as 
an early contribution of new psychology to this i nvestigation but freud app lied an existing theory 
while jung used a comparative method it is concl uded that the new psychology is not yet advanced 
enough to present a theory of the mind that would have universal application yet movements are being 
made in that direction

in a lecture at the institute of  medical psychology tavistock clin ic london  the question of 
psychology and national problems is discussed in the c ontext of world war i and subsequent events it 
is suggested that some aspects of the world situat ion are amenable to psyc hological evaluation certain 
individual symptoms arise from mi sery and disorder including positive ones such as greater effort and 
organization and negative ones such as emotional formation of groups with  infantile and archaic 
psychology when formed groups such as nations exhibit traits comm on to all the people but none of 
their individual achi evements they react like a primitive group being the implications of this 
psychological formulation are elabor ated as they relate to democracy and other forms of government 
the state ruling groups money indi vidual leaders and state symbol s the role of the collective 
unconscious in political processes is described and it is sugge sted that political events occur in cycles

observations on the quality of swiss li fe and the nature of the swiss ch aracter are offered the return to 
the simple life is welcomed even though it demands considerable sacr ifice and is not voluntary recent 
social conditions are com pared to ne gative exam ples from america and the propensit y of people to live 
for and in the future is deplored a minimum degree of austerity is pronounced beneficial as it enforces 
simplicity which is true happiness but to live simp ly without bitterness is a difficult moral task for 
many people instead of relying on team spirit it is suggested that priority be given to developing the 
individual personality and the swi ss characteristics of mistrustfulnes s and obstinacy are suggested as 
virtues that have protected the swiss in the past it is concluded that more good for switzerland will 
come from sober skepticism and sure  instinct than from propaganda ta lk and artificial stimulation of 
team spirit and ra tional regeneration

jung  it is pointed out that  jungs psychology rests on experiences with human beings not with 
academic postulates therefore it is concerned with the unconscious mind rather than just the contents 
and functions of consciousness it is predicted that investigation of the psyche is the science of the 
future for the greatest danger to man is a psychic da nger particularly from the masses in whom the 
effects of the unconscious accumula te and stifle the reasonableness of the conscious mind to protect 
himself from war it is concluded that man mu st not arm himself but mu st discover the psychic 
conditions under which the unconscious mi nd overwhelms the conscious mind

and driving them back into mens unconscious minds fr om which they arose originally is discussed in 
terms of contemporary events in germany in   although many scientif ic achievements are

 civilization in transition the effect  of technology on the human psyche  in jung c 
collected works of c g jung vol  prince ton university press   p p   
observations regarding the effect of technology on the human psyche are offered considering that 
technology consists of procedures invented by man it  is not entirely outside the human sphere certain 
modes of human adaptation to it are possible the re petitious procedures of technology are compared to 
the patterns of primitive labor yet it is suggested that modem man doe s not have the same tolerance for 
them in modern man technology is an imbalance th at leads to dissatisfaction preventing man from 
exercising his natural versatility on its own me rits technology is neither good nor bad but depends on 
the individuals attitude toward it to prevent his other mental capacities from atrophying for example 
an engineer may study philosophy the final question is whether man has sufficient reason to resist the 
temptation to use his technol ogy for destructive purposes

who driven by unavoidable conflicts of duty are tryi ng to integrate the unconscious into consciousness 
neumann is commended for attempting to formulate th e ethical problems raised by the discovery of the

intended to describe an unimaginable transcendence  together they comprise the collective unconscious 
because the unconscious is ambivale nt producing both good and bad effect s the image of god is also 
twofold the dangers and fears of surr endering oneself to the holy spirit are said to be so great in view 
of this ambivalence that no one today would suggest that he is possessed by it the task of the holy 
spirit is to reconcile and unite the opposites in th e individual through a special development of the soul 
which like god is paradoxical the holy  spirit will manifest himself in  the psychic sphere of man and 
will be presented as a psychic experience he th en becomes the object of empirical psychology through 
which he can translate his symbolism into the possi bilities of the world the holy spirit becomes of 
extreme importance for it is thanks to him that the man of good will is drawn towards the divine drama

individual andor collective vision at the time howev er spiritual reality could not be demonstrated to 
the uneducated except through tangibl e miracle stories psychologicall y the resurrection represents the 
ancient myth of the hero who conquers death and restores  life it represents the projection of an indirect

 alchemical studies alchemy and psychology  in jung c collected works of c  jung 
vol  princeton university press   p p   
the relationship of alchemy and psychology is explained in terms of the symbolism of the two 
disciplines because the alchemists did not understand the nature and behavior of chemical substances 
they drew conscious parallels between the unknown processes and mythological motifs and thus 
explained the former these unknown processes were then amplified by the projection of unconscious 
contents comparative research has confirmed that al chemical symbols are partly  conscious va riations o f 
these mythological motifs and part ly spontaneous products of the uncons cious parallel with the content 
of modern dreams the principal symbol of the tran sformed substance in alchemy is mercurius and the 
ways in which this symbol is consistent with char acteristics of the unconscious are outlined it is shown 
how the alchemical opus portrays the process of i ndividuation but in a projected form because the 
alchemists were unconscious of  this psychic process

koenigfachsenfeld  the book is welcomed as filling a gap in the philosophical side of complex 
psychology and the rapprochement between empi rical psychology and philosophy is explained 
although experimental and medical ps ychologists originally used purel y scientific methods it became 
obvious that their principles had to be subject to  philosophical criticism be cause the object of their 
judgment was the psyche itself no ju dgment about the psyche can be to tally empirical but is reduced to 
phenomenology or pure experience th e resemblance of this concern with experience to that of the 
romantics is suggested in a brief history of romant ic thought it is conceded that jungs psychological 
conceptions can be regarded as romantic but they  are also scientific and rationalistic the underlying 
premise is the reality of everything psychic a concept based on an appreciation that the psyche can also 
be pure experience

feminine psychology are recognized and a means for re solving the conflict betw een them is suggested 
neither men nor women understand much of wo mens psychology which includes a peculiar 
spirituality but this is hardly surprising because people know almost nothing of the unconscious psyche 
and such knowledge is necessary to  understanding between the sexes a conflict exists between man as 
a biological instinctual creature a nd as a spiritual and cultural be ing a compromise between the two 
can be achieved only in relation to the other se x psychology is therefore needed as a method of 
relationship providing real knowledge of the other se x instead of arbitrary opinions which are the 
source of misunderstandings hardings book is welc omed as a contribution to knowledge of human 
nature and a clarification of the confus ion in relations between the sexes

disregard for the unconscious makes one unaware of  his own unconscious conflicts producing injurious 
effects on marriage and on chil dren  whereas the old psychology viewed only the contents of 
consciousness depth psychology rec ognizes that an unconscious proces s underlies every conscious one 
 because the unconscious is complex the various sc hools of depth psychology that approach it from 
biological physiological mythological and religious points of view all ha ve validity  care must be 
taken to avoid preconceptions in the analysis of data  in depth psychology  an alytical psychology uses 
interpretation of dreams and drawin gs and the anal ytical relationshi p to reveal the patients total 
psychological situation and help him restore the original wholeness of  the personality  analytical 
psychology does not regard itself as a substitute for re ligious confession but ofte n functions in a similar 
way  knowledge of the unconscious can bring an  increase in tension followed by release  
preoccupation with oneself is not e gocentric in the usual sense but is  necessary for growth  greater 
selfknowledge gives one a more re alistic view of ones  abilities and opens the door to greater 
communication with others  because individuals di ffer integration of the unconscious takes place in 
many different ways

gives insight into the mentality of the second cent ury ad and early concepts of christ and helps 
explain why the christian message was taken up by th e unconscious mind of that age the text is 
described particularly as a phenom enon of assimilation representing th e specifically psychic reactions 
originating in the unconscious aroused by the impact of the figure and message of christ on the pagan 
world the therapeutic necessity of confronting the pa tient with his own dark si de the unconscious is a 
secular continuation of the christian develo pment of consciousness and leads to phenomena of 
assimilation similar to those found in gnosticism the kabbala and hermetic philosophy since real 
understanding of the human psyche requires knowledge of  mans spiritual history the codex will be of 
great practical as well as theo retical value at the institute
