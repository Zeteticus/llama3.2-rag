through examples from several alchem ical texts the significance of mercurius as the synthesizing or 
union of the pairs of opposites in the quaternio is discussed these texts are then related to their 
christian religious background the arrangement of opposites into a quaternity is illustrated by an 
analysis of the four goddesses in st olcenbergs viridarium chymicum a nd the abulqasim in the latter 
example ostanes stands between masculinefe minine goodevil opposites and is subject to the 
compulsion of the stars iea tran sconscious factor beyond the reach of the human will as a result he is 
a diversity of persons whereas he should be one herm es points out that he oranes shares something 
incorruptible in his nature a unity symbolized by a crown or kingly totality the quaternio of the 
consilium coniugii is cited and the ogdoad or double qua ternio of bemardus trev isanus is illustrated by 
a diagram in this instance the center of unity is expressed symbolically as being in the indian ocean 
the unconscious it symbolizes the microcosm the mystical adam  and bisexual original man where 
he is identical with the unconscious the quaternio of the scholia to the tractat us aureus hcrmetis is 
presented illustrated by a diagram and analyzed wi th the spirit of mercurius representing the unifying 
agent of the opposites mercurius is seen as both th e original man discrimina ted in crude form through 
the physical world and as the reconstituted total ity in sublimated form he is likened to the 
matrimonium or coniunctio of opposites the alchemical terms pe lican mercurius lapis circle and 
hermetic vessel are related to the mandala and to sy mbols for christ found in the epistles the gospels 
and the shepherd of hermas the goal of the alchem ists endeavour was to arrive at an ecclesia 
spiritualis above all creeds and subj ect solely to christ  references

collected works of c g jung vol  nd ed princeton university press   p p   
the alchemical symbols orphan widow and moon are related to the images found in classical 
mythology the patristic writings and the cabala a link between the precious stone orphan found in 
the writings of albertus magnus and the lapis philo sophorum mentioned in carm en helviodori petrus 
bonus and dom is established this  analysis of orphan leads to discussion of the term widow as a 
symbol of alchemic prima  materia mother of the lapis philos ophorum parallels are drawn between the 
myth of isis and the synonyms used for prima mate ria or the feminine pr inciple in alchemy the 
paradoxical joybittemess destroyer healer roles of both are emphasize d and related to the christian 
belief in transubstantiation as  well as to aztec and e gyptian m yths it is shown that alchem y replaced 
the sponsussponsa christian image with  one of material and spiritual to tality personified by mercurius 
the union of sapientia and matter feminine with the holy ghost and the devil the cabalan malchuth 
is recognized as having been assimilated into the al chemical imagery of the widow as was the patristic 
sponsussponsa symbol the paradoxical symbol of the moon as sour ce of light and also destroyer of 
light sol sun is traced  through alchemical writings the writi ngs of augustine and motifs from aztec 
and egyptian writings the motif of wounding associated with the eclipse with christ and the church 
hecate and persephone and the writings of zosimos an d philaletha show that the goal of the alchemist 
was to root out the original sin with the balsam of life a mixture of natural heat and radical moisture 
this redemption was to be accomplished through the art of alchemy further elucidation of this 
redemptive role accomplished by kinosis emptyi ng is provided by quotations from rahner st

a parallel is drawn between mani chaean and alchemic views on the sources of evil the method of 
salvation and dualistic nature of  the savior figure anthropos  me rcurius the story of manes or 
cubricus the son of the widow is recounted and he is  identified with the alchemic kyrius gabricius a 
name derived from an ar abic word meaning sulphur the term bl ack sulphur used in the alchemists 
texts to refer to the active masculine substance of mercurius is compared to the manichaean term hyle 
or matter the dark fluid human bod y of evil principle the manichae an dualistic christ figure the 
anthropos is likened to the alchemic dualistic re deemer of the microcosm  christ and of the 
macrocosm lapis philosophorum the role of sweat as rain in manichaean teaching as a means of 
freeing light material from dark  bodies is compared to the dew or arcanum of alchemy the acta 
archelai of manichaeism with its saving wheel is seen to be reflect ed in the rota of alchemy the 
comparison of these two systems reveal s the deathrebirth drama hidden in th e coniunctio it is stated that 
the moral task of alchemy was to bring the feminine maternal background of the masculine psyche into 
harmony with the spirit  references  
 the paradoxa  the arcane substance and the point  in jung c collected works of c g 
jung vol  nd ed princeton univ ersity press   p p   
an overview of several alchemic writings indicates the prevalence of  paradoxes and the importance of 
the point in alchemy the paradox is a natural resu lt of the alchemists a ttempts to visualize the 
opposites together and to express them in the same  breath as the adjectives used to qualify arcane 
substance lapis prima mate ria and mercurius indica te they are at one and the same time base and 
noble precious and cheap one and many visible to  all and unknown the paradox of mercurius is 
presented as the paradox par excellence citations from john dec the turba dom paracelsus steeb 
maier and others illustrate the significance of the point in alchemy the point is the smallest written 
sign used to symbolize the mystery of four elements the center of nature the sun point in the egg it 
corresponds to fire light worlds cent er the godhead it is the mode of the perfect form the properties 
of gold are listed as they relate to the point the ci rcle eternity the godhead a nd indivisible substance  
 the paradoxa  the scintilla  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  nd ed 
princeton university press   p p   
the alchemical doctrine of the scintilla or spark is presented the symbol of the eye is examined and its 
significance is explained in psyc hological terms the concept of sp ark or scintilla is found in the 
writings of meister eckhart hera ctitus hippolytus and simon magus as well as in those of the 
alchemists alchemists defined the spark as arch aeus the fiery centre of the earth which is 
herma phroditic consistin g in a con junction of male and female the parallel to adam kadmon the 
original man of jewish gnosis and the product of the conjunction of sun and moon is noted the 
significance of the eye as a symbol of the scintilla is  discussed and related to the doctrine of gnosticism 
and manichaeism the psychological  analysis of the eye and sun as symbol and allegory of the 
consciousness which is the mark of the ego complex is compared to the alchemists view of the union 
of the scintillae to form gold sol and the gnostic goal of reintegratin g atoms of light doms concept of 
the scintilla an invisible sun in the centre of man and a fire point created by tension of masculine and 
feminine principles in mercurius is examined as in  khurachs description of th e scintilla as elixir the 
resemblance between khuraths concept and that of monoimos is noted  
 the paradoxa  the enigma of bologna  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol

an epitaph found in bologna and known as the aelia laeliacrispis inscripti on is cited and it is 
demonstrated that both the epitaph which was in real ity a joke and the numberless interpretations of it 
reveal the workings of the collective unconscious a review of the interpretations is provided with 
special attention given to those of barnaud maier  malvasius senior rich ard white veranius and 
schwartz the interpretations of barnaud and maier ar e based on alchemical concepts of prima materia 
lapis dismemberment panacea and coniunctio the interpretation of malvasius reveals anima 
projections and feminine ar chetypes the oak a feminine numes is seen to be the source of the fountain 
a vessel mother and the source of life attention is drawn to similar imag es in modem dreams the 
motif of the oak tree is examined in the fight of th e cadmos myth with its symbols of loss of anima in 
the realm of the unconscious incest relationship transition to exogamy the battle of split off complex 
and the moral problem of opposites this same myth is given an alchemic interpretation cadmos is 
mercurius in his masculine form sol in search of his feminine counterpart l una in order to destroy 
the chaos he must kill the serpent to allow the coniunc tio or harmony of elements to occur the spoils of 
the battle are offered to the oak tree representative of the unconsci ous the source of life and harmony 
both the enigma and the commentaries are seen as  perfect paradigms of th e method of alchemy in 
general analogies are found in medieval literature in vita merlin the epig ram of the hermaphrodite 
attributed to mathieu de vendome and in the niobe ep igram richard whites definition of the soul as 
the selfress of all mankind is interpreted as a possi ble reference to the collective unconscious attention 
is given as well to his discovery of the androgynous nature of the human soul comment is made on the 
veranius interpretation as a forerunner of fre uds sexual theory of the unconscious schwartzs 
interpretation in which the monument is understood as the church is considered significant in that the 
symbol of the church expresses and substitutes for all the secret s of the souls which humanistic 
philosophers projected into the aeli a inscription the study of both the inscription and its interpretation 
leads to the conclusion that the collective unc onscious through archetype s provides a priori 
conditioning for the assignment of meaning  references  
 the personification of the opposites  introduction  in jung c collected works of c g 
jung vol  nd ed princeton univ ersity press   p p   
the fundamental opposition seen by the alchemists as a malefemale opposit ion is analyzed in terms of 
the incest conflict described by freud the expressi on of the conflict as malefemale opposition is 
explained by reference to the primal  guilt mentioned in genesis and th e opposition in nature between the 
physical and the spiritual the goal of the former is vi ewed as union that of the later discrimination the 
alchemists awareness of this problem  is shown by an analysis of their myth of the king of the sea and a 
description of the dual goa l of alchemy the discovery of gold as a panacea for the physical and the 
rebirth of light from the darkne ss of physis heali ng selfknowledge and the deliverance of the 
pneumatic body from the corruption of the flesh the christian attempt to  restore the state of innocence 
through monasticism and celibacy is contrasted with th at of the alchemists the former used the image 
of the christian s piritual marria ge of s ponsus christ  and s ponsa church  and offered a purely spiritual 
solution the latter used the image of chymical marri age coniunctio of sol and luna and exalted incest 
it is shown that both attempts fail because the imag e of the oppositon of the sexes must be resolved in 
another realm the soul of man the reason for the di fficulty of this solution is explained and freuds 
discovery of the oedipus complex as a universal pr oblem is analyzed as a psychopathological form of 
the natural problem of the union of opposites  
 the personification of the opposites  sol  in jung ccollected works of c g jung vol 
 nd ed princeton university press   p    
the alchemical attributes of sol are presented analyzed and related to the psychological concept of the 
ego sol is perceived as a virtuous  or generative and tr ansforming power found both within man and in 
the universe since it was considered  to be a single element it was to be the source of universal power o f 
growth healing magic and prestige from which th e gold could be generated however it too had its 
shadow capable of destroying symbolically then the sol image is seen as an expression of the 
physiological and psychological drama of  return to prima materia a death necessary for returning to the 
incorrupt preworldly paradise the coniunctio of sol and mercurius is  discussed and an analogy is 
drawn to the christmary relations hip the differences between the ch ristian dogmatic schema and that 
of the alchemical scheme s are illustrated with qua ternal diagrams the contrast between the upward 
movement of the alchemical dram a from darkness of earth to spiritual light and the downward 
movement of the christian drama the scent of the kingdom of heaven  to earth is presented it is 
concluded that alchemical projections sketch a pict ure of certain fundamental  psychological facts one 
being the primary pair of  opposites consciousness and unconsciou sness symbolized by sol and luna 
sol is interpreted as a projection of the ego since the latter is the indispensable condition for all 
consciousness a distinction is drawn between the conc ept of the self as the suprapersonal atman the 
totality of conscious and unconscious and the ego th e personal atman the central reference point of the 
unconscious the alchemists came close to recognizing that the arcane substances and the longed for 
lapis were the ego  reference  
 the personification of the opposites  sulphur  in jung c collected works of c g jung

the alchemical attributes and effect s of sulphur are presented and related both to the christ image as a 
psychic archetype and to the structure of the psyc he as perceived in modem psychology citing several 
texts some alchemical qualities are attributed to  sulphur it is the prima materia of sol and the 
companion of luna it possesses a psychic double na ture burning and corrosive  heating and purifying 
corporal and spiritual earthly and occult the source of all living thi ngs and the end product its effects 
are shown to be equally dua listic it consumes and purifies it is  a coagulating tincturing maturing 
principle on the one hand it is identified with diabol us on the other with christ it is a synonym for the 
mysterious transformative substance  a parallel is drawn between propert ies of sulphur as they appear in 
the texts of dom paracelsus the turba and the consiliu m coniugii and the role of christas redeemer 
basic to both conceptions is the jungian concept of the self which is defined as the human totality 
greater than the ego conscious personality and em bracing ego consciousness the personal shadow and 
the collective unconscious the discoveries of the alch emists are considered to  be more important to 
psychology than to chemistry since they revealed the psychological existence of the shadow which 
opposes and compensates the conscious  positive figure as well as th e hidden structure of the psyche 
this latter discovery is illustrated by means of the christflapisunconsc i ous equation in which the 
unconscious is considered as the medicine for the untrustworthy sulphur a symbolic representation of 
the motive factor in consciousness sulphur is comp ared to unconscious dynami sm or compulsion which 
springs from both shadow and anthropos c ontained in the unconscious  references

turbae among others the alchemical characteristics  of luna are presented and analyzed as the 
counterpart of sol luna is cold moist dark fe minine corporeal passive a nd a partner in coniunctio 
luna is personified as sister bride mother and sp ouse symbolized as the vessel of the sun and funnel 
of the earth she is responsible for the conception of the universal seed of the sun in the belly and womb 
of nature the symbol of the moon as a tree or plan t is discussed and related to the tree symbols of 
arabic alchemy the cabala christianity and hindui sm the connection of luna moon to intellect 
and to the contrasexual archetypes in the unconscious is  presented along with an analysis of the gnosis 
of simon magus as an example of the description of  a masculofernina pneuma the neotic qualities of 
luna the lunamercurius relation and the role of l una in the transformation mystery are examined in 
the light of the alchemic texts the negative aspects of luna are evident in the disadvantageous position 
given to luna compared to that of sol and in the attr ibution of appetites or sens ual powers the sphere of 
the moon the psychological interpreta tion of the luna indicates that the alchemists perceived the union 
of sol consciousness and luna unconscious to be dangerous and producti ve of poisonous animals 
first cold blooded then warm blooded predators and fi nally birds of prey the alchemical role of luna 
is compared to that of the virgin mary and the church  in that it partakes of earths sufferings standing 
on the borderline between etheral eternal th ings and the earthly sublunar sphere  
 the personification of the opposites  luna b the dog  in jung c collected works of c

the process of uniting the contents  of the unconscious with the conscious mind is presented through the 
analysis of imagery in alchemic texts in these texts both sol conscious and luna unconscious are 
represented theriornorphically as dog and bitch respective ly indicating the awareness that both the 
conscious and the unconscious have negative fearsome  aspects several texts are examined showing a 
linking of three forces flying bird house and stone hermaphrodite doves and rabid dog winged 
youth diana and thief numerous functions of the dog as symbol in alchemic texts are explained with 
particular attention given to the rabid dog as a symbol  of the unconscious that turns into a winged eagle 
a symbol of the transformation process involved in the healing of the psyche the archetype of incest is 
examined as it appears in dreams and in the alchem ic images it is explained as a parable for the 
preliminary form of the union of opposites  
 the personification of the opposites   luna c the alchemical allegory  in jung c 
collected works of c g jung vol  nd ed princeton university press   p p   
it is suggested that dreams or alchemical para bales which constitute the daily fare of the 
psychotherapist can be translated into rational sp eech through knowledge of the dreamers alchemists 
personal situation or symbolic assumptions although it is conceded that dream interpretation can hardly 
ever be convincingly proved the second of philalethas  texts is examined as a dream and the question is 
raised whether the author really had such thoughts and ideas concealed in ornate metaphors in the 
dream the thief or robber of the self is contrasted  with the winged youth who represents the spirit of 
inner truth that measures man not by his relation to the mass but by his relati on to the mystery of the 
psyche it is the age old struggle of  evil versus good expressed in alch emical language just as today the 
struggle is expressed in conflicting ideologies good an d evil are seen as spiritual forces outside of man 
who is caught in the conflict we learn that the winge d youth is espoused to the central water but he 
will become real only if he can unite with luna the mother of mortal bodies it is concluded that 
psychology can unravel the secrets of alchemy but not lay bare the secret of its secrets

salt and a number of symbols clos ely related to salt such as sea water and the baptismal quality and 
bitterness of the ca are discussed as aspects of the unconscious sal is associated with lunar 
symbolism and is a member of the triad sulphurmercuriussal which from the time of paracelsus was 
seen as corresponding to the trinity since mercur ius has both masculine and feminine qualities this 
triad like the trinity is really a quaternity the fourth figure in alchemy the dark luminary feminine 
side of mercurius is identified with the devil in ch ristian tradition the assumption of mary in catholic 
doctrine is discussed as an example of the ultimate acceptance of his necessary fourth figure lacking in 
the trinity salt in alchemical ph ilosophy is identified as the symbol  of the arcane substance this 
concept is traced to early arabic influence on latin texts such as the turba  where salt water is a 
synonym for the aqua permanens this association with the arcan e substance is found to be more clearly 
supported in the iter alchem ical texts  references

associated with salt and sea is the quality of bitt erness an alchemical term connoting not only the sharp 
salt taste of the a water but al so corruption and imperfection this co rruption is the quality of the prima 
materia which is synonymous with alchemical and my thological tradition with chaos and the ea it is 
noted that the sea was often characterized as someth ing impure in ancient cultures especially that of 
egypt and greece in the same cultures  and in ancient china as well at  is often found characterized as a 
spirit and identified with bird this bird represen ts the spirit of corrupti on expelled om an impure 
substance which is made pure thereby it is sually said to have many colors this and other spirits of 
imurity constitute that part of the universe which is still chaos nd in  the psychological sense that part of 
the psyche which emains unconscious as the spirit of chaos is indisp ensable to the alchemical world

the red sea has a unique symbolic value in contrast  with the bitterness and impurity usually associated 
with the sea it represents the heating and transf orming properties of baptisma l waters the destruction 
of the egyptians trying to cross the red sea is seen as an allegory of the inability of the unenlightened 
unaware to be transformed more sp ecifically it is the inability of th e incomplete psyche to find whole 
ness the resistance of christian tradition to the acceptance of the other the unconscious and 
primitive as part of the order of life is viewed as a barrier to th e very salvation it purports to seek 
numerous references to the significance of the red sea in alchemical thought are examined allusions 
are found to a symbolic vehicle wh ich is immersed in the red sea a nd purified the vessel is commonly 
characterized as combin ing the four  elements as a reflecti on of the unity of the world in psychological 
terms the vessel symbolizes the psyche combini ng the four functions of consciousness which goes 
through a period of introversion leading to the idea l integration of the personality similar chariot 
are discovered in indian mythology and in the song of  songs the frequent association of a serpent with 
the chariot is discussed in terms of the serpent as the anima mundi an image of  the arcane substance

allegorical content in particular maiers comparis on of the seven mouths of the nile to the seven 
planets and his description of an ascent and descent through these seven planetary spheres is seen in 
terms of a reunion of higher and lower powers it is  noted that in christia ngnostic tradition this 
symbolic transformation involves de scent and subsequent ascent resurr ection while in the text in 
question and in alchemical interpretation in general the reverse proc ess operates the soul in alchemical 
thought rises into the spiritual realm but is not made whole until its descent into  the center of the earth 
this ascent and descent are seen to represent the realization of psychic oppos ites a realization which

the shepherd of hernias further comparison of th e two texts reveals a number of analogies in the 
stages and events of the journey toward enlighten ment both are seen to symbolize the psychological 
motif of the search for psychic wholeness through c onfrontation of conscious process and unconscious 
content the original state of spiritual confusion ex perienced by the seekers lead s in modern therapy to 
an analysis and interpretation of irrational thoughts expressed in dreams and fantasies anamesis the 
acceptance of this material from the unconscious wide ns the perspective and awareness of the conscious 
mind and enables the enriched personality to better cope  with its environment it  is noted that the seven 
spheres had great significance for ancient astrologers as well and that a journey through the planets 
meant to them a systematic shedding of character tr aits ordained by each planet another model for the 
journey is found in the gnostic redeemer the peculi ar reticence of maier to describe the last

agent recommended for baptism in certain parts of th e christian bible the alchemists professed to a

associated with the christ figure in that both are iden tified with the anima mundi  the creative substance 
scriptural references are cited in which salt is synonymous with wisdom in the form of godly 
revelation or human insight the psyc hological interpretation of salt as a symbol of the self finds support 
in the dream material and drawings  of patients in whic h a crystalline substance is commonly seen to 
represent the center the self the duality of bitterness and wisdom re flects the struggle of the psyche 
salt is further associated in al chemical tradition with the moon the earth and the feminine nature the 
duality in the nature of salt is expressed by a numbe r of different al chemical and religious symbols 
however the alchemists appear to have had cons iderably more understanding of the imagery involved 
than did the later christians they recognized the dark  part of the psyche and of the world whereas the

similar parables the agent of resurr ection is the sweet water the aqua permanens citations from several 
alchemical treatises demonstrate th e importance of water in the symbol ic process of tr ansformation in 
the writings of dorn it is clear that the soluti on process was viewed as more a spiritual phenomenon 
than a physical one a psychic union of conflicting elements into one substance although it is not

theology does not recognize weakness or corruption in  god in order to enter the kingdom of god the 
king of the cantilena must return to he initial worl d state of massa confusa where all elements are n 
conflict this transformational proc ess is accomplished through a retu rn to the mother and through her 
the original substance of the lapis of seven sym bolic colors both the lapis ind peacock figures 
symbolize the reunion of all elements in alchemic al tradition the great amount of overlap in the 
symbolic structure of alchemical beliefs exemplified in the cant ilena is considered due to the 
archetypal nature of the symbols which arise from a comingl ing homoousia in the unconscious the 
numerous appearances of animals as symbolic motifs in the cantilena represent the return of the king to 
the tiunal state the psychic source of revitalizat ion for this reason imag es of savage animals 
predominate the animals are often associated with  feminine figures again symbolizing the lark 
unconscious aspect of the king which must be assimi lated the transformation it self is seen as taking 
place in isolation it is a dissolu tion a very similar proces s to that symbolically described by the mass 
the historical development of th e ancient art of alchemy into m odem analytical science is not 
considered surprising in view of th e enormous enthusiasm of the alchemists for research further the 
alchemists are felt to have been much more in t ouch with psychic reality than many ater philosophers 
particularly in their realization of the importa nce of assimilation of conflicting elements

the phase of decay and death nigredo leading to the re birth of the king is examined it is noted that the 
common symbol of immersion or sinking into the de pths had a distinctly paradoxical character in 
alchemical literature signifying both a return to th e corruption of the sea and a purification through its 
renewing powers this and other para doxes were basic to alchemical thought which carefully preserved 
he idea of the polarity of all thi ngs this perspective is consider ed a healthy one whereas extreme 
onesideness developed n the name of  clarity is seen as a dangerous imbalance in both the psychic and 
the social sense the reborn king is frequently symbolized by the mercurial serpent figure and the 
phoenix regenerated first as a worm from its own destruction in alchemical symbolic structure 
mercurius is synonymous with he life force whic h connects and thus transforms the chaos the

the correspondences between the alchemical figure of  the king and the christ figure are discussed in 
terms of their resource in the archetypal projections  of the unconscious the alchemical motif of the 
dissolution of the kingly ma tter and its eventual gene ration has many parallels in  the passion of christ 
however the psychic connotations this  symbolic configuration had for th e alchemists is much closer to 
the basilidian conception of the redeemer than to the christian it is felt that this image of christ as 
man suppressed by christianity re flects a primordial a nd preconscious archetype expressed by many 
early cultures the fact that christia n tradition even partially manifests th is archetype is considered to be 
the reason for the widespread acceptance of the dogma  the archetype is recogni zed subliminally by the 
practitioner of the rite the gnostic symbol of the inner man was the anthropos he is chinese 
alchemys chenyen dorns vir unus  and the lapis philosophorum he is  characterized as an integrated 
individual rather than a redeemer of others the struggles of the hero  figures in alchemical texts are 
similar in form to the passion of ch rist but not in purpose for the hero in the former sacrifices the self 
to redeem the self in an allegory of the psyc hes struggle for wholeness this emphasis on the 
psychological theme in alchemical tradition is suppor ted by citations from dom and chinese alchemist

the constellation of alche mical symbols surrounding the rebirth of th e king is discussed in terms of the 
integration of the psyche through conscious acceptance  of unconscious material the female symbol of 
lunamother is identified with the unconscious in th e psychological sense and with the virgin mother 
in christian tradition the king is seen as synonymous with the sun and with the light of consciousness 
or more specifically the su bjective ego personality which is consci ousness the deterioration of the king 
personality occurs as the psychic process becomes more and more limited to  the conscious functions 
repressing the vast unconscious and un aware of its dynamic nature it is  at this point in the psychic 
process that dreams and fantasies abound created by the strain of imbalance betw een the two functions 
if the uncon scious is still not confronted and analy zed neurotic symptoms foll ow a historicoreligious 
analogy to psychic decadence and rein tegration is seen in the dominant  christian view of the world in 
the middle ages and in the changes christian doctr ine underwent under the influence of protestantism 
the shedding of catholic ri tual  and dogma and particularly the re jection of the femi nine element the 
cult of the virgin led to the dominance of the rati onal in protestantism the spirituality of the dogmatic 
image receded into the unconscious it is suggested that the popularity of alchemy in the th and th 
centuries is due to the surviving psychic need for c ontact with the complete ar chetype a need unfulfilled 
by protestant doctrine as the dominance of the cons cious at the expense of the un conscious leads to 
neurosis in the individual so it led to the religious wars and bloody c onflicts of the age of 
enlightenment in light of these observations the im portance of conscious acceptance of eternal images

human a symbolic expression of the union of psychic opposites is allude d to in christian texts but not

this representation of the unconscious pr ocess of rebirth of the self it is  felt that the reason the figure of

as the prima materia this substance was regarded as  a piece of the original massa confusa primordial 
but capable of organization and tr ansformation as the ordering of the universe is symbolized as a unity

primordial androgynous beings are also found in pl atos spherical original being in the persian 
gayomart and in arabic hermes mythology however fe w traces of this idea are found in alchemical

the process of selfknowledge as a step toward psychic union is  discussed in historical and

difficult in ancient times as it is now and for this  reason primitive man constr ucted all sorts of rituals 
and religious experiences to make  contact with the unconscious whil e still being protected from it 
today this function is performed by the formalized  religions when certain archetypal expressions 
become ineffective through social or  scientific progress new formulat ions evolve which represent the 
archetypal myth according to the mores and attitudes of the new culture a prime example of this process 
is considered to be the progressive reinterpretati on of the christian doctrine throughout its history since 
christianity has traditionally denied the body however other compensatory belief systems grew with it 
which concerned themselves with natural bodies as well such a system was alchemy which began to 
flourish as early as the th century the dilemma of the analyst is seen to be his inability to provide his 
patients with more than partial solutions he can effect ively cure certain aberrations in their behavior or 
thought patterns but he cannot solve the everyday human problems with which he himself struggles 
real selfknowledge must by achi eved by the individual although the analyst may provide the initial

the two aspects of man strive for union is considered demonstrable however it is a tendency evidenced 
by the discontent of the alchemists under the purely sp iritual doctrine of chris tianity the intolerable 
dissociation of consciouss piritual at the expense of the unconsc iousphysical led them to attempt a

an ideal psychic state in which the gap between cons cious and unconscious is bridged ile reality of the 
confrontation becomes manifest in th e process in which the conscious must strain to resolve the psychic 
conflict this struggle is considered the source of  the numinous experiences of some patients in the 
course of their therapy the histor ical acceptance of these intimate psychic experiences as spontaneous 
expressions of religious or mystical  truths make them difficult to e xplain in purely scientific terms

pathological or as divine inspir ations derive from an overwhe lming breakthrough of unconscious 
material into consciousness the metaphysical interp retations ascribed to these psychic happenings are
