volume iv freud and psychoanalysis 
 freuds theory of hysteria  a reply to aschaffenburg  in jung c collected works of c g 
jung vol  princeton university press   p p  
freuds theory of hysteria is defe nded against aschaf fenburgs criticism of the role assigned to sexuality 
in the formation of the psychoneuroses this criticism  is directed specifically  at freuds psychology of 
sexuality the determinants of hysterical symptoms  and the early methods of his psychoanalysis 
aschaffenburg accepts the view now generally supported that hysteria is a psychogenic illness that 
surely an essential component of the psyche is sexua lity aschaffenburgs claims  that there are entirely 
traumatic hysterias prove only that not all cases of  hysteria have sexual roots his point is not valid 
unless it is demonstrated by the psychoanalytic method he asserts that this method is autosuggestion on 
the part of both doctor and patient but again ther e is no proof the associat ion experiments which 
uphold the results of psychoanalysis have nothing to  do with autosuggestion and can be repeated by 
anyone aschaffenburg considers explor ation of the patient for sexual ideas immoral in many cases the 
decision on the use of sexual enlightenment in treatm ent can be made only on the basis of whether it 
harms or helps the individual not on the basis of hi gher considerations it is  concluded that freuds 
theory of hysteria has not yet been proved errone ous that such proof could be supplied only by 
psychoanalysis that psychoanalysis has not produced re sults other than freuds  and that psychoanalysis 
itself has not been discredited  
 the freudian theory of hysteria  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  
princeton university press   p p   
the development of freuds theoreti cal formulations on hysteria is tra ced they are defined as working 
hypotheses that agree with his experience rather th an a formal theory by  freud and breuer had 
concluded that psychogenic symptoms arise from feel ing toned complexes of ideas  that have a traumatic 
effect by conversion into abnormal so matic innervations classical hysteri a or by displacement to a less 
significant complex obsessional neurosis the trau matic affect is not abreacted as in a normal person 
because it is incompatible with the consciousness a nd is repressed the following year the results of  
analyses led freud to announce that the etiology of hysteria is found in sexual traumas of early 
childhood after extensive research into gene ral sexual psychology and dream psychology and 
refinement of his psychoanalytic tec hniques his present views have been  formulated a certain perverse 
infantile sexual activities which do not lead at first to symptoms of hysteria are retained b at puberty 
the fantasies tend in the direction of  the infantile sexual activity leadi ng to complexes of ideas that are 
incompatible with the consciousness and are repressed c  with the transfer of the libido to a love object 
the struggle of the libido against th e repression causes the outbreak of  actual illness it is not known 
whether freuds schema can be applied to all forms of hysteria but his findi ngs are true of a large 
number of cases further investigation is recommended  references  
 the analysis of dreams  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  princeton 
university press   p p   
in a discussion of freuds work on the analysis of dreams the dream is defined as a product of psychic 
activity susceptible to analysis it  is far from meaningless or a result  of somatic sensation freud calls 
the confused images typical of dreams the manifest cont ent behind this is the essential latent content in 
a dream he asks why this particul ar person dreams this particular thi ng since the dream is individual an 
in agreement with the psychological disposition of the subject gretchen s song in faust telling of a 
faithful king clearly reflects her concern with fausts fidelity fre ud says every dream represents the 
fulfillment of a re pressed wish in gretchens son g the pain of dwellin g on the real characters  herself 
and faust  is too strong to be openly admitte d similarly wishes that form the dream thought are 
desires repressed because of their painful character  the mechanism that prev ents the repressed thought 
from showing itself clearly is called the censor dire ct questioning is not useful in getting beyond the 
manifest content a full associat ion exercise may be used or th e subject may be questioned about 
associations attaching to the striking portions of the dr eam it is difficult to get the subject to associate 
freely without arousing resistances the method of  overcoming resistance gradually by finding small 
associations one at a time is ill ustrated by analyzing a young bachelors dream of a dinner in company 
with the pope and several attractive young ladies in which the dreamer was constantly obliged to leave 
the party because of a need to urin ate the analyst asked about the di nner the seating arrangements the 
dream characters features etc and the subject associated to each of these until analysis of more major 
elements could proceed study of the psychoanalytic method is recommended not  only for psychiatrists 
and neurologists but also  for psychologists  
 a contribution to the psychology of rumour  in jung c collected works of c g jung 
vol  princeton university press   p p   
the case of a yearold girl who had been expelled from school  for starting an ugly rumor about her 
male teacher sheds light on the psychology of rumor and shows how rumor figured in the interpretation 
of a dream the youngster had simply reported a dream to her classmates in th e dream she and a sister 
changed into bathing suits in the presence of boys because of lack of room then went swimming with 
their teacher rode on a steamer took part in a wedding went on a journey like a honeymoon spent 
the night in a barn again for lack of room a nd the dream ended with th e teachers becoming the 
godfather of a womans child the versions of the classm ates as they identified with s in her repressed 
desire for sexual relations with the teacher function  as interpretations of the dream some are more 
explicit than others some of the versions have s riding on the teachers back while swimming rather 
than riding on a steamer others introduce two unknown fat men the teacher was plump for the swim 
many other versions reported by ss classmates who had heard her tell it refer to  indecent parts of the 
dream that the children refused to  describe s had been troublesome to the teacher of whom she had 
originally been fond after the teacher had given her a bad report ss dream operated first as an 
expression of her repressed wish fo r sexual union with him compensating for the hate consciously felt 
and then in the retelling as a me ans of getting back at him  
 on the significance of number dreams  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  
princeton university press   p p   
examples show that number dreams reveal the unconscious roots of number symbolism rather than 
conscious speculations on the symbolic relations be tween numbers one example is that of a middle
aged man engaged in an extramarit al love affair whose dream invol ved a large number analyzed to 
represent the total of important date s and ages for his famil y severe conflicts were apparent due to the 
patients attachment to his family and love for hi s mistress another dream involving a number showed 
the patients repressed tendency to reckon the costs of his affair in his waking lif e the patient gave free 
rein to number fantasies for instance celebrating when he was  their hundredth birthday with his 
yearold mother he played with the numbers appear ing in his dreams and by association related them 
to expressions of envy and wish fulfillment another example is given by the dream of the patients wife 
her entire dream was luke  alluding in various chapterverse combinations to passages from that 
book the number has a dual representation expressing how many children she would have had if all 
including miscarriages were living and a repr essed fantasy desiring the death of her husband 
although the patient herself was quite unfamiliar with the bible the content of the material found in 
luke  in luke  and in luke  can be in terpreted as expressing wishes for more children 
rejection of her husband resentment of his impoten ce and the wish for him to be cured of his 
impotence  
 morton prince the mechanism and interp retation of dreams a critical review in jung 
c collected works of c g jung vol  pr inceton university press   p p   
morton princes article on an analysis of six dreams of a patient is critici zed as being unscientific 
although prince is commended for his interest in the controversial s ubject of dream analysis prince 
agrees with freud that dreams have a meaning that the meaning is hidden in symbols and that memory 
material is needed to find the meaning he disagr ees however with freud s view that every dream 
represents a wish fulfillment finding that some drea ms represent fear or anxiety these dreams clearly 
illustrate transference to the anal yst on the part of the patient a middle aged woman suffering from 
hysteria dissociation but prince doe s not interpret them that way dr eam i has not been sufficiently 
analyzed as prince ignores the significance of a man in a dressing gown bringing firewood dream  
which prince interprets as the patients fear that she will become ill again can be seen as the desire to 
fall ill again to retain the analysts attention prin ce sees the third dream in which the doctor pounds the 
patient with a stone to hammer it into her head that  he cannot be bothered with her as nonfulfillment of 
her wish for his attention but it actu ally represents an erotic wish th e fourth dream has been censored 
by prince unscientifically deleting intimacy in th e fifth dream which prince has made no attempt to 
analyze offering instead a general impression the pa tient is forced to walk through cats without making 
a sound although s had a cat phobia the dream cats repr esent love and the aphonia that persisted after 
the dream was a symptom with which to interest the analyst prince does not see any repressed wish or 
conflict in the sixth dream  but it concerns vengeful tortures th at the patient probably desires for the 
analyst who is abandoning her these dreams are insuffic iently analyzed or misinterpreted because some 
elements are ignored and the meaning is too often take n literally instead of symbolically it is concluded 
that prince has no basis for a serious criticism of freuds dream theory when his own methods are so 
lacking in scientific thoroughness  reference  
 on the criticism of psychoanalysis  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  
princeton university press   p p  
a discussion of criticism of psyc hoanalysis notes that the strongest  antagonism comes from physicians 
and psychologists most laymen unde rstand the truths of psychoanalysi s and realize that a psychological 
proof must be different from a phys ical one the violent resistance of professionals usually arises from 
scientific prejudices based on a different way of th inking these critics attack the psychoanalytic method 
as if it rested on a priori principles whereas it is actually purely empirical  occasionally however the 
critics scientific att itude is warped by his personal feeli ng a sarcastic review by kurt mendel 
presented in entirety expresses repugnance at the la test work on anal eroticism the sexuality of 
children and the exposure of the vul gar aspects of sex in general mendel believes that freudian 
teaching has opened up many new and valuable perspect ives but finds it filled with exaggeration and 
fantasy and questions the concept of the universality of sexual feelings it is felt  that such criticism has 
scientific value and deserv es reading  references

university press   p p   
a letter to an editor defends psychoanalysis against some of the charges brought against it no reply is 
offered to critics who say the theory is wrong becaus e they think the method is morally dangerous or to 
those who claim that the facts unearthed by freudian s do not exist as no one can assert a priori that 
certain facts do not exist the sexual indelicacies that  appear in psychoanalytic literature are not to be 
blamed on psychoanalysis itself medical work merely  brings the fantasies to light blame for their 
existence lies with our sexual morality psychoanalyti c education covers not only sex but every facet of 
life and its goal is not to deliver man to his passions but to help him attain selfcontrol the concept of 
libido is taken in a general sense like the instinct of preservation of the s pecies it does not mean 
localized sexual excitation no one should blame psychoanalysis itself becaus e there are some clumsy 
and irresponsible people who misuse it for their own purposes  reference  
 the theory of psychoanalysis foreword  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  
princeton university press   p p   
a series of lectures on the theory of psychoanalysis is introduced in an attempt to outline the prevailing 
attitude to the guiding principles evolved by freud from long experience in spite of heavy and often 
premature criticism psychoanalysis has continued to flourish in europe and america as a scientific 
discipline psychoanalysis needs to ta ke stock of itself th is attitude has been wrongly interpreted as a 
split in the psychoanalytic m ovement although present experien ce does not approach freuds 
extraordinary experience and insight some more mode rn formulations are felt  to express the observed 
facts better than freuds version this moderate cri ticism is intended to promote continued growth of the 
psychoanalytic movement  reference  
 the theory of psychoanalysis  a review of the early hypotheses  in jung c collected 
works of c g jung vol  princeton university press   p p   
a review of the early psychoanaly tic hypotheses shows how some of th ese concepts have changed over 
the years the trauma theory developed by breuer a nd freud held that neuros es were derived from a 
trauma in early childhood normally the excitation was abreacted but was retained in hysteria the task 
of therapy was to release the accumulated excitati on this cathartic method was bound up closely with 
the symptoms in contrast to psychoanalytic techni ques in use today the concept of repression the 
mechanism by which conscious content is displaced into the unconscious  is based on observation of the 
neurotic capacity for forgetting significant even ts the concept of repression is somewhat in 
contradiction to the trauma theory as it suggests an etiological theory of environment while the trauma 
concept is a theory of predisposition pursuit of the solution to this riddle led to the theory that the 
childhood trauma was sexual freud abandoned the idea  that all childhood sexual traumas had actually 
occurred and it is now assumed that many of thes e traumas are childhood fantasies the sexual element 
in a trauma is according to freud chiefly res ponsible for its pathological effect precocious 
manifestations of sexual fantasy an d their traumatic effect now seemed to be the source of the neurosis 
an opinion that has me t opposition and indignation the decision as to what is th e truth must be left to 
observation and research  references  
 the theory of psychoanalysis  the theory of infantile sexuality  in jung c collected 
works of c g jung vol  princeton university press   p p   
freuds theory of infantile sexuali ty is discussed and the more mode rn divergence from some of these 
views is noted the discovery of precocious sexual fa ntasies led freud to assume the existence of a 
richly developed infantile sexualit y a biological conception of sexuality includes such phenomena as 
pregnancy birth natural selection and a series of psychological and physiological functions sexuality 
may be identified with the instinct for preservation of the species in some contrast to the instinct for 
selfpreservation some of freuds conclusions are cons idered untenable freud is inclined to see even in 
the infants sucking at the mothers breast a ki nd of sexual act this assumes that sexuality  
preservation of the species  exists apart from the nut ritive function  selfprese rvation  as in adults 
but it is not possible to separate the two modes of the life instinct at this stage both intrauterine and 
extrauterine periods of infancy belong to an asexual stage of nutrition and growth acts such as sucking 
the fingers while evidently pleasurable belong more to the sphere of nutrition these acts can lead into 
distinctly sexual acts as the chil d derives pleasure from  his own body freuds belief that the childs 
sexuality centered on his own body is perverse becau se of analogies with s ubsequent perversions he 
then h ypothesized that sexualit y is divided into a pluralit y of several drives giving rise to the conce pt of 
erogenous zones such as mouth skin anus etc the later monomorphic sexua lity is thus conceived 
as consisting of several component s perversions exist at the expense of normal sexuality increased 
application of one form of sexuality follows a decrea se in the application of another form the example 
of a young man who was homosexual in his teens a nd heterosexual in his twenties returning to 
homosexuality after being jilted illu strates the mobility of the sexual components the theory thus far 
does not explain how such transformations come  about freuds conception of components was 
modified to be replaced by the libido conception of energy  
 the theory of psychoanalysis  the concept of libido  in jung c collected works of c g

an extensive discussion of the concept of libido el ucidates freuds accepted definition a basic sexual 
need  hungerdesire and formulates  a total libido theory to include modern research and concepts 
regarded as a dynamic unity the libido is discussed in context of the energic theory whereby it is 
compared with the laws of energy conservation the unconscious fantasy systems are held to be objects 
of the libido only in neuroses conservation of the li bido involves the nature of infantile libido and the 
theory that abnormalities and perversions exist in childhood in latent form manifestations and 
distinctions of the libido in three phases of life  presexual prepubertal and mature  are briefly 
contrasted thoughts on sexual termi nology point out the difficulty of  applying them to prepubertal 
children in whom intensity of the libido is not any less than in adults though the localization of it may 
be different discussion of the li bido problem in dementia praecox bri ngs out how the patients lack of 
adaptation to reality is compensated by a progressive  increase in the creation of fantasies a genetic 
conception perceives libido as a type of psychic energy that manifests it self in the life process and is 
subjectively perceived as conation and desire the in fantile perversions as a libidinal concept round out 
the theory on infantile sexuality which in turn is important to the theory of neuroses the nutritive 
function of the libido sucking is one of the childs transitional pha ses which develops into normal 
sexuality at maturity  references  
 the theory of psychoanalysis  neuros is and aetiological fa ctors in childhood in jung c 
collected works of c g jung vol  prince ton university press   p p   
to clarify those events of childhood that lay the foundation for later neuroses the roles of sexual 
predisposition the parental complex and general pa rental influences are discussed the sexual 
predisposition toward neurosis is conceived as a retard ation in the freeing of th e libido from activities of 
the presexual stage maturity points up the retarda tion leading to dissociation of the personality the 
inadequacy of the trauma theory is illustrated by the case of a patient who reacted hys terically to bolting 
horses a peculiar early fantasy system rather than traumatic childhood events is responsible for 
uncontrolled affect in the patients later life this invo lvement of libido in fantasy activity rather than in 
real life demonstrates partial in troversion the parental complex in which emotions still cling to the 
parents effigies contributes to this retardati on of the libido the imitativ eness of primitives and 
children often to the point of inner identification with parents explains the strength of parental 
influences many neurotics spoiled as children a nd expecting the same tende rness from the outside 
world that they received from their families realize the di fference between the past and the present but 
are unable to adapt because of the lag of emotions behind intellect i reference  
 the theory of psychoanalysis  the fantasies of the unconscious  in jung c collected 
works of c g jung vol  princeton university press   p p   
the concept of the unconscious the functions of the dream dream analysis and the association 
experiment in reaching the unconscious are discussed the unconscious with its infantile fantasies is 
considered the ke y to the etiolo gy of neurosis remarkable parallels are evident between the fantas y 
products of the unconscious a nd ideas from mythology though th e patient may be uninformed on 
mythology the dream is an effect of the unconsci ous expressed in terms of conscious symbolism 
dream analysis seeks associations to images in the dream showing their origin in the recent past dream 
material consists of elucidated me mories of these experiences combin ed with meaningful associations 
and connections the association experiment is a basi cally simple test by which the influence of the 
unconscious may be explored and certain complex indicat ors identified these in turn point to potential 
disturbances when such phenomena are cumulative they constitute a neuros is the effect of an 
unconscious constellation  
 the theory of psychoanalysis  the oedipus complex  in jung c collected works of c 
g jung vol princeton universi ty press   p p   
the most frequently occurring childhood fantas y the oedipus complex is described and its 
development is explained the complex which can be viewed simply as the demand for parental love 
can have a very intense affect in children though le ss sexual than an adults emotion since the childs 
first love is directed toward the mother a girl may also have an oedipus complex the complex may 
involve the childs unconscious wish to kill the father and have the mo ther to himself the element of 
eroticism gains strength with the year s so that the complex assumes the classic form in maturity if the 
child cannot free himself from his in fantile milieu in the postpubertal period the complex will precipitate 
a conflict with possible neurotic disturbances the now sexually developed libido shapes into the 
oedipal mold raising fantasies that show the ex istence of the complex which until now has been 
unconscious intense resistances to th ese immoral impulses may manifest  themselves either in direct 
violent resistance against the father and affection toward the mother or by compensation in marked 
submissiveness to the father and antagonism toward  the mother sometimes th ese attitudes alternate 
normally the libido moves outside the family for obj ects aided by religion which leads it away from 
the infantile objects toward symbolic representati ons of the past according to freud the oedipus 
complex is pushed into the unconscious by a mo ral repression called th e incest ba rrier

a discussion of the development of neurosis invest igates the etiological si gnificance of unconscious 
determination conflicts of the pr esent moment regression of the libi do and the relative weighting of 
traumatic events and innate characteristics uncons cious determination is illustrated by the case of the 
young woman with a hysterical reaction to bolting horse s freuds theory of infantile sexuality is 
considered an inadequate explanati on of adult neuroses it is refuted in the doctrine of the period of 
sexual latency this period is really the beginning of sexuality and everythi ng that precedes it is 
considered a preliminary stage with no real sexual character th ere is little etiological significance 
assigned to infantile development the cause of the pathogenic confli ct is found more often in the 
present childhood experiences have a significance for neurosis only when they are made significant by 
a regression of libido in which the reminiscences de termine the form while the present supplies the 
dynamic element this reversi on to the infantile level is  illustrated in the case of two sisters who reacted 
differently to conflicts presented by approaching marriage  it is concluded that the sole cause of neurosis 
is neither a traumatic event nor a predispositi on but that both function to produce the condition 
regressive fantasies serve not only as a neurotic substitute for action but fo r both normal and neurotic 
persons as groping attempts to find new ways of adapting to reality  
 the theory of psychoanalysis  ther apeutic principles of psychoanalysis  in jung c 
collected works of c g jung vol  prince ton university press   p p   
some thera peutic techni ques are discussed with em phasis on the dan gers and advanta ges of the use of 
transference as an instrument in trea ting neurosis the analysts entry into  the patients fantasies serves to 
bring up these fantasies from the unconscious and to free the attached libido this often results in the 
patients attaching to the analyst fa ntasies formerly attached to parent  images although this transference 
can be a bridge to reality the hazard is that it can become too comfortable for the patient a parallel is 
drawn between psychoanalysis and relig ious confession but the guiding role  is rejected for the analyst 
as his goal is to educate his patients to become indepe ndent analysis of the transference must then take 
place to free the libido comp letely from fantasy and to overcome th e patients infantile equating of love 
with demands for attention the analyst must have gone through psychoanalysis himself so that his own 
infantile demands do not identify with those of the patient the technique of analyzing the transference 
is the same as in the first stag e of the analysis with dreams now utilized not only to understand the 
involvement of libido in fantasy but as a guide to the use of the freed libido dreams may be considered 
subliminal combinations of future events these futu re tendencies are elaborate d freeing the patient from 
the semiinfantile transference a nd ending treatment a brie f discussion of future uses of psychoanalysis

an analysis of an l lyearold gi rl is presented as an example of the actual process of psychoanalytic 
treatment and a demonstration of  regressed libido the child had a clinical history of nausea and 
headache that kept her from school and had also been  blackmailed by a little boy who had heard her call 
her teacher a name in  interviews the pleasures of  staying home from school the girls liking for the 
teacher and her unhappiness at losing the teachers esteem were brought out also discovered were her 
concerns with the mysteries of pregnancy and childbirth fear of  her father experiences with 
masturbation and the desire to have a baby herself an account is given of how the material was drawn 
from the child how her dreams were used both in el iciting material and in aiding her selfunderstanding 
and of how the analyst explained the material and it s interpretation to the child in addition there are 
extensive comments on the symbolism found in the childs dreams and on philosophical aspects of the 
analysis that were never mentioned to the pati ent parallels are drawn between mythology and the 
fantasies of the modern individual it  is suggested that much of this childs difficulty could have been 
prevented by receiving clear se xual information at home  
 general aspects of psychoanalysis  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  
princeton university press   p p   
a discussion of the principles of psychoanalysis suggest s that it is now a science which could be called 
analytical psychology that ha s grown from psychoanalytic te chniques working through the 
unconscious rather than the conscious psychoanaly sis attempts to overcom e neurotic disorders by 
relying on clues furnished by the patient the analysis  starts with an examin ation of the conscious 
content supplied by the anamnesis the associati on experiment is applied in studying the patients 
current conscious activity examples from the inte rview of such an experiment are included the 
analysis of dreams is considered a valuable instrument of psychoanaly sis but in the early stages of 
treatment most patients cannot recall enough detail for complete successful analysis patients who do 
not dream or who cannot  recall their dreams are usually hol ding back conscious material dream 
images are interpreted both sexually and as symbols of other areas and an overtly sexual dream may 
have other connotations freuds concep t of the dream as a disguise for repressed wishes is discarded in 
favor of the idea that the dream is a subliminal pi cture of the actual psyc hological situation of the 
individual in his waking state th e volitional content of th e dream which freud call s the repressed wish 
is considered essentially a means of  expression practical limi ts to the analyst on his attitude toward the 
patient and general philoso phical as pects of psychoanal ysis are included  
 psychoanalysis and neurosis  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  princeton 
university press   p p   
freuds theory of neurosis is reviewed some asp ects of it are questioned and an energic concept is 
substituted for the purely sexual po int of view freuds etiological  progress from the early childhood 
sexual trauma to infantile sexual activity has led to his la test view that the neurotic  is fixated to a certain 
early period and that the main task of treatment is to resolve this in fantile fixation this  point of view 
seems doubtful however since in many cases ther e is no sign of neurosis until the moment of 
breakdown it appears rather that the neurotic has a congenital sensitiveness cau sing early resistance to 
adaptation and that the outbreak of neurosis occurs  when a new psychological adjustment is required 
when the libido meets an obstacl e that seems insurmountable and th e individual abandons the task of 
overcoming it the stored up libido regresses to an abnor mal adaptation it is still considered important to 
investigate the infantile sexual fant asies but they are regarded as symptoms not causes the treatment 
goal is to free the libido fr om them and to bring it under control of the will

questions arising during the analysis of dr l oy undertaken to assist loy in his practice of

cathartic method and suggestion therapy through hypnosis the relation of these methods to the 
phenomenon of transference and ethi cal questions comparing the confli cts of researcher and physician 
when one man is both psychoanalysis is regarded as a more scientific treatme nt but in practice the 
method the physician feels will work best with the pati ent whether it be hypnosis or full analysis is the 
preferred modality questions from loy concerning the role of the ps ychoanalyst in society suggesting 
that he is an educator are postponed until a later stage in the analysis  and more study of the literature 
is recommended dr loy brings up pos sible differences in ai m for the patient the patients need to 
understand the psychoanalytic method and the limit of  responsibility of the analyst for the patients 
future in commenting on these points the nature and function of transference ar e explained criticizing 
any interference on the analysts part  with the patient progress the pos itive value of transference is 
reasserted relating it to his conception of biological duties and the moral question of helping patients 
to adapt to both their own internal demands and th e external requirements of society is discussed  
 prefaces to collected pape rs on analytical psychology  in jung c collected works of c 
g jung vol  princeton universi ty press   p p   
prefaces to the first and second editions of collect ed papers on analytical psychology concentrate on 
the attitudinal differences between the viennese and the zurich schools of psychoanalytic thought the 
viennese school takes an exclus ively sexualistic stand and inte rprets the psychological symbol 
semiotically as a sign of primitive psychosexual pr ocesses its method is an alytical and causal the 
zurich point of view is symbolistic adding a positiv e prospective value to the symbol its methods are 
synthetic and prospective freuds principle of hedonism and adlers th eory of the power principle are 
not necessarily unfounded as both principles operate in  everyone but they are considered incomplete 
finality in addition to causality is presented as a psychological principle  and it is pointed out that life 
will not allow uncontrolled expression of either ch ildish pleasure seeking or  childish power seeking 
freuds vienna causality is mechanistic jungs zurich finality  is teleological and functional both 
views are necessary to understanding psychological  functioning and they are not antagonistic if 
regarded as regulative principles of thought rather th an constituent principles of the process of nature

 the significance of the father in  the destiny of the individual  in jung c collected works 
of c g jung vol  princeton univ ersity press   p p   
four case histories illustrate the influence of the  imago of the father on the lives of the children as 
the fathers personality is overwhelming in each of thes e cases it is postulated that the power derives not 
from the individual human being but from the repres entation in him of a preexistent instinctual model 
or pattern of behavior an  archetype this is the imago charged wi th dynamism that cannot be attributed 
to an individual human being the first case a woma n who married a man much like her father and on 
being widowed remained so for ye ars provides an example of li ving out a copy of ones youth the 
second case is a man whose life re peats his masochistic homosexual relationship with his father the 
third presents a woman who sacrifices all present ha ppiness on the altar of bei ng dutiful to a now dead 
father the last case concerns an yearold boy who used bed wetting to separation mother from father 
these cases show that the parent al influence even though represse d into the unconscious directs the 
maturing mind the role of the father imago is an ambiguous one characteristic of the archetype whose 
potentialities exceed human capacity  in the unconscious  references

the historical social and philosophi cal ramifications of psychoanalysis are discussed in an introduction 
to kranefeldts work on psychology positive aspects of the developm ent of psychoanalysis include a 
worldwide interest in psychology seen  in medicine and criminal law and one negative effect is the 
decline in religion adlers individual psychology which has developed into a system of social 
education has grown away from freud s psychoanalysis jungs point of view  is pluralistic in contrast to 
their monistic psychologies a more  positive value assigned to the unconscious leads to a different 
interpretation of dreams and fantasies which are seen as creative seeds of the future the unconscious is 
the basis of vitality and must be united with the conscious but freuds approach which does not 
emphasize the unconscious is not mistak en in cases where consciousness is  not firmly established as in

introversion and differentiated functions de monstrate the complexity of the psyche
