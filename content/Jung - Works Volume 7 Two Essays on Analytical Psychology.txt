the five prefaces introducing this  volume indicate that the origin al work the psychology of the 
unconscious process has been revised and refined many times the purpose of the work mentioned in 
the  and  editions is to provide a broad survey on the nature and the psychology of the 
unconscious the growing concern with  the human psyche and the interest in mans chaotic unconscious 
is seen as a result of the first world war this c oncern motivating selfreflecti on is seen as a favorable 
trend since the psychology of nations and that of indi viduals are interrelated th e hope is expressed that 
the individuals return to his own deepest being will re sult in a cure for the illnesses of the times it is 
frequently noted that this work attempts to populariz e a highly complicated scienc e still in the process of 
development the essay is not intended to be co mprehensive its purpose is to supply background 
information to be used as an introduction to the unconscious because this study is virtually virgin 
territory the essay may contain inadequacies and errors  the preface to the fifth edition the edition that 
applies to this volume indicates that the previous versions had b een thoroughly revised and that the 
material on psychological types has been included in a separate volume title psychological types

a brief overview of the theories  which led from experimental psychology to a psychotherapy of 
neuroses is presented along with an analysis of a case study illustrating the role of the unconscious in the 
development of neuroses charcot janet bernheim liebault and freud are compared and breuers 
work is singled out at the starting point for this new psychology breuers cl assic case of anna an 
hysterical neurotic is used to illu strate the socalled trauma theory numerous other hysterical neuroses 
are presented freud is cred ited with carrying breuers work forward and pos ing the problem in terms of 
predisposition a term used to signify the role of an  early unconscious trauma in  neurosis the hysterical 
disorder of a young female patient is explored in detail revealing the ro le of a disturbance in the erotic 
sphere as well as the presence of a trauma  as a factor in cr eating the neurosis  
 on the psychology of the unconscious  the eros theory  in jung c collected works of 
c g jung vol  nd ed princeton un iversity press   p p   
a general discussion of the role of the erotic conflict  and its place in neurosis precedes the discussion of 
the techniques of psychoanalysis and therapy the historial role of sexua l conflict in the development of 
psychoanalysis is discussed methods of analyzing the unconscious include hypn otism association and 
dream analysis dream analysis the most importa nt method is described a hypothetical dream is 
presented and evaluated in terms of the theory of wish fulfillment the purpose of freudian 
psychoanalysis is explained as an a ttempt to make the animal instincts conscious in order to incorporate 
them into a purposeful whole freuds theory of repr ession of sexuality as the foundation of neurosis is 
evaluated and it is concluded th at although it is grounded on a true  and factual principle it is 
nevertheless onesided and exclusive a broader unde rstanding of eros as energy is suggested as the 
key to arriving at a harmony between spirit and instinct the goal of psychoanalysis  
 on the psychology of the unconscious iii the other point of view  the will to power  in 
jung c collected works of c g jung vol  nd ed princeton university press   p p 
   
freuds theory of neurosis based on eros and adler s theory which stems from the will to power are 
compared and contrasted the instinct of selfprese rvation and its relation to the will to power are 
examined in the light of nietzsches teachings an an alysis of the dangers lurking in an identification 
with the shadow iewith just one of the instinct s explains nietzsches neurotic onesidedness the 
importance of both eros and the will to power manife sted in a drive for the preservation of the species 
and selfpreservation are stressed wagner is menti oned briefly as an advocate of the former and 
nietzsche as his polar opposite  a clinical case is studied in detail  from two perspectiv es freuds belief 
that a neurosis arises from antece dent circumstances causality and ad lers contention that teleological 
causes are paramount the freudian  analysis concentrates on eros the adlerian approach emphasizes 
the power instinct and they contra dict one another  reference

collected works of c g jung vol  nd ed pr inceton university press   p p   
the attitudes of introversionextr aversion are introduced to expain the opposition of the freudian and 
adlerian viewpoints theories are s een as reflecting an authors pecu liarities and consequently they are 
often narrow in scope the two very different theories of neurosis the first emphasizing the object and 
the second emphasizing the subject ar e viewed as manifestations of a type antagonism the introversion 
personality type focuses on the subject the extrav ersion type focuses on the object however these 
types are seldom observed in a pure state the dyna mics of a relationship between individuals who 
possess opposite personality types is examined in contra st with the views of freud and adler neuroses 
are described as sometimes serving useful adjust ive functions freud and adler are criticized for 
refusing to recognize the inexorable role of irrationa l fate in the development of both humanity and the 
individual psychic energy defined as libido is the focus of much  of the discussion examples are 
used to demonstrate that the ps ychic energy released during treatme nt follows an unpredictable path 
known only to the unconscious this energy has its s ource in the tension of opposites and can only be 
used when the proper gradient is found several type theories all based on opposites are cited it is felt 
that in order to advance in treatment ie to achie ve a balance in the psyche one must recognize the 
principle of opposition  references

the idea of the collective unconscious  is introduced and its role in the process of transference in 
psychotherapy is discussed guidance for the existen ce of the collective unconscious is found in ancient 
myths and primitive religions robert  mayers discovery of the conserva tion of energy is presented as 
evidence of the workings of the transpersonal uncons cious and of the manner in which the archetypes or 
primordal images may contribute at times to our intellectual adva ncement on the other hand the 
harmful effects of introjec tion and projection are al so pointed out the transition between the two stages

 on the psychology of the unconscious vi  the synthetic or constructive method  in jung 
c collected works of c g jung vol  nd e d princeton university press   p   
it is suggested that the traditional method of dream  analysis reduction must be followed by synthesis 
when the symbols originate in the collective unconsci ous the value of this approach is supported by a 
detailed dream analysis utilizing both the redirectiv e and synthetic modes of interpretation the process 
of reconciling the conscious with the unconscious or dealing with both the real and imaginary is termed 
the transcendent function a dream re ported b y a female patient is inter preted in two wa ys and used to 
support the use of the synthetic m ode this constructive subjective process refers the dream images 
back to the patient while the freudian analytical  objective method equate s dream images with objects 
in the real world it is recommended that the th erapist should search for archetypal motifs when an 
analytical dream interpretation no  longer elicits ne w information if these are found the interpretive 
procedure should be altered ac cordingly  references  
 on the psychology of the unconscious vii the archetypes of the collective unconscious  
in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  nd ed princeton university press   p p 
  
lengthy analyses of the dreams of two patients one female one male are presented as examples of the 
importance of the archetype in revealing the contents  of the unconscious the examination of the dreams 
demonstrates that material from the collective unconscious is often projected onto persons in the 
immediate environment attention is given to the magic demon a commonly projected archetype and 
several references to this and other symbols from li terature religion and histor y are cited as examples 
the purpose of dreams is stated dr eams act as a compensation aid in  maintaining psychic equilibrium 
and serve as a mental corrective the analysis of th e dreams of the male patient demonstrates that the 
symbols and metaphors of the dream are a preparation for effective therapy one of the basic themes 
revealed in dream analysis is that of the individua tion process defined as the goal of the transcendent 
function ie to uncover and facilitate the original  potential wholeness of the individual the whole 
discussion emphasizes how important it is for the ther apist to gain a complete understanding of dreams 
and the various manifestations of  the unconscious such an understanding enables the therapist to 
prevent the formation of unconscious oppositions a nd to utilize the healing fa ctor of compensation

the risks and the benefits of gain ing an understanding of the unconscious  are described and reference is 
made to the contributions of fre ud adler and nietzsche to this unde rstanding the dangers inherent in 
the unconscious are demonstrated by allusions to late nt psychoses controlled by artificial normalcy and 
to overt manifestations which often take the form of  accident proneness however  the favorable side of 
the unconscious is also presented one who has the ca pacity and urge for higher differentiation can gain 
access to its therapeutic potenti al only by means of this transcendent function can harmony be 
achieved the therapist is advised to meet the need s of the individual since no formula can indicate how 
and when a cure will be effecte d concluding remarks concern tire di ffering views of practitioners in

in prefaces to the second  and third  editions the purpose of the work the relation 
between the ego and the unconscious is cited to  give a summation of  years of psychological and 
psychiatric experience in order to form an intelle ctual conception of the unconscious the idea that the 
development of the unconscious is an independent pr ocess a view which distinguishes these theories 
from freuds is traced back to a study of so mnambulism made in  the present book describes the 
relation between the conscious and the unconscious al though it does not claim to offer the final answers 
to the nature and essence of the unconscious it  is mentioned that oriental philosophy has been 
interested in similar problems for cen turies and thus is valuable as comparative material  references

the personal and the collective unconscious are defi ned and freuds view of the personal unconscious 
the storehouse of repressed material  is expanded to include energized conscious material as well as 
subliminal sense perceptions the unconscious is seen  as acting in a compensatory fashion creating the 
seeds of future conscious thoughts these unconsci ous processes and all the unconscious material 
acquired during the individuals lifetime are defi ned as the personal unconscious a case study is 
presented that reveals the presence  of certain unconscious material beyond the scope of the individuals 
life experiences the presence of this material is  explained by postulating the existence of a collective 
unconscious to illustrate this theory the case of a female patient who has reach ed the upper limit of the 
therapeutic benefits of transference is presented in order to discover a more permanent basis for her 
recovery her dreams thought to be indicators of hidden psychic processe s and desires are analysed in 
one of her dreams the analyst assumed superhuman pr oportions akin to those of a gigantic primordial 
father this dream also contained an image of god as the wind which was inte rpreted as the patients 
longing for absolute faith this image is not person al since the woman an agnostic thought of god as 
an abstract life force and was unaware that the phrase g od is spirit is a free translation of the original 
greek of the new testament that reads god is wind thus an historic image of world wide distribution 
is shown to have come into existence again through a natural psychic function it is concluded then that 
the unconscious contains not only personal but also impersonal and collective components in the form 
of inherited thought categories or ar chetypes furthermore it is s hown that these archetypes can be 
restored to consciousness by the prim itive analogical mode of  thinking peculiar to dreams  references  
 the relations between the ego and the unconscious part  the effects of the unconscious

c collected works of c g jung vol  nd ed princeton university press   p p 
  
the salutary effects of the assimilation of the unconscious and consciousne ss are studied and the 
dangers inherent in uncovering the collective unconsci ous are examined typically the individual feels 
either unduly elated or depressed upon discovering the contents of his personal unconscious both are 
reactions to the obliteration of former conscious psychic boundari es that the uncovering of the 
unconscious inevitably produces when the opposites of the conscious and the unconscious are brought 
together the analysand feels either cursed by the evil in him that went pr eviously unperceived or 
vindicated by the unperceived good the cure is seen  as stemming from the individuals abifity to 
recognize that the two taken together comprise hi s reality if however portions of the collective 
unconscious are dredged up with the personal uncons cious the results can be catastrophic the 
transpersonal contents of the unconscious are living entities and the individuals discovery of their 
existence within his own psyche can lead to personalit y disinte gration the develo pment of personalit y 
demands strict differentiation of  the individual from the collectiv e psyche a partial or blurred 
differentiation can lead to the melting away of the individual into the collectiv e the annexation of the 
deeper layers of the unconscious can on the other ha nd lead to an enlargement or inflation of the 
personality this inflation can be ha rmful or beneficial depending on the individuals ability to assimilate 
the new knowledge it is important th erefore in practical treatment  to keep the integrity of the 
personality constantly in mind a nd avoid over loading the patient with too much knowledge of his 
unconscious  references

upon consciousness  the persona as  segment of the collective psyche  in jung c collected 
works of c g jung vol  nd ed princet on university press    p p   
the distinction between personal a nd collective unconscious is reiterat ed and persona is defined in 
relation to the collective psyche the persona consists of the sum of psychic facts that are felt to be 
personal it is however only a mask for the collect ive psyche ones real individuality lies in the 
unconscious self which despite the ego consciousness feeli ng of exclusive identity with the persona 
makes itself felt directly and indirectly in th e choice and delineation of the persona through the 
analysis of the personal unconscious the conscious mind becomes suffused with collective material 
which brings with it the elemen ts of individuality the case of the philosophy student presented in 
chapter one is reviewed as an example of the manner in which individuality and aspects of the collective 
psyche begin to emerge in a coalescent state once pe rsonal repressions are listed in an almost magical 
way the collective psyche begins to determine the indivi duals fate it is often be neficial in analysis to 
induce artificially a predominan ce of unconscious influences this breaks down the persona and 
undermines the authority of the conscious mind there by leading a patient past a difficulty that might 
block further development as long as the conscious mind is capable of assimi lating the products of the 
unconscious the latters instinctive inclination to co rrect the balance of the conscious mind will be 
beneficial however if the unconscious simply rides roughshod over the conscious mind a psychotic 
condition will develop  reference

regressive restoration of the persona  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  nd ed 
princeton university press   p p   
regressive restoration of the persona  is described as an unsatisfactory attempt by the patient to extricate 
himself from the collective psyche  the contact of the unconscious psyche and the collective psyche 
results in a collapse of the conscious persona a tr aumatic event for the patient to escape it some 
people climb to new heights while others dive into  the abyss below those people who categorically 
reject and repress the contents of the collective ps yche are cited as examples of the second form of 
escape which inevitably leads to th e reestablishment of a now diminish ed persona this is likened to 
fausts rejection of freedom and yearning for a simple life sinc e ones earlier state of naive 
consciousness cannot be recovered the person who choos es this road often lead s a life of resignation

princeton university press   p p   
the effect of identification with the collective psyche  as a means of escaping th e trauma resulting from 
the colla pse of the conscious persona is described to free himself from the embrace of the collective 
psyche instead of denying it as in  regressive restoration of the pe rsona the afflicted individual accepts 
it so totally that he is devoured by it becomes lost in it and thus is no longer capable of perceiving it as 
a separate entity such people often feel that they  possess a great truth there are powerful psychological 
inducements for holding onto this identification with  the collective psyche it  enhances ones life 
feelings promises a rich harvest of knowledge and makes one feel as though life has suddenly acquired 
a new direction but the final effect s of identification are considered harmful in that one does not reap 
the benefits of the collective psyc he but merely becomes one with th em inflation despite the seeming 
rewards and gratifications accompa nying inflation it is shown that the ability for effect ive selfcriticism 
vanishes

press   p p   
individuation as an alternative a nd more desirable form of development than those forms wherein the 
collective psyche has the upper hand is discussed the a im of individuation to divest the self of the false 
wrappings of the persona and the suggestive powers of primordial images is presented although the 
persona is easily understood by all since everyone can  consciously experience it the workings of the 
unconscious processes are seen to be  more difficult to understand sinc e they are more subtle analyses 
of those unconscious factors can be effected in part by examples from me ntal illness creative inspiration 
and religious conversion the unconscious is seen as standing in a compensatory relation to the 
conscious mind several examples from case histories are presented to illustrate the specific ways in 
which the unconscious performs its compensatory function in general it works by producing images 
usually revealed in dreams that respond to a conscious situation in so doing the unconscious does not 
think but rather acts automatically since mans c onsciousness is circumscribed this compensatory 
function of the unconscious supplies psychic contents which if properl y recognized extend the range of 
consciousness the result of this pr ocess is evaluated the increase in selfknowledge diminishes the 
layer of the personal unconscious that is superimpos ed over the collective unconscious  references  
 the relations between the e go and the unconscious part  individuation  anima and 
animus  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  nd ed princeton university press  
 p p   
the animaanimus concepts are pres ented and defined in relation to th e process of individuation for the 
purposes of psychological inquiry the soul is defi ned as a semiconscious psychic complex that has 
partial autonomy the feminine part of a mans soul is called the anima the souls femininity derives 
from three sources mans life e xperiences with women the inherite d collective image of woman that 
exists in mans unconscious and an innate psychic stru cture that allows man to experience in the subject 
manner of woman fundamental differences in the psyc hes of man and woman are said to exist man is 
described as more objective and rational woman as  more subjective and emotional man represses his 
feminine qualities in order to de velop his persona hence the relati on between the anima and the persona 
is compensatory since complete identification with  the persona leads to neurosis the compensatory 
function of the anima is salutary in order for i ndividuation to take place  however man must free 
himself from both the persona and the anima and real ize that the interplay be tween the inner and the 
outer forces represents the energetic s of the life process the polar te nsion necessary for selfregulation 
because the anima is an inner process and harder to rec ognize it is more difficult to deal with than is the 
persona as a method for perceiving the anima it is suggested that it be ob jectified iegranted the status 
of a separate concrete entity a nd allowed to speak by making th e anima conscious the individual 
builds a bridge to his unconscious since the animus is the corresponding entity in women it plays its 
role in the develo pment of a womans personalit y  references

the aim of differentiation and tec hniques for facilitating it are exa mined individuation the attainment 
of a personality at midpoint betwee n the ego consciousness and the unconscious is seen as the result of 
differentiation in order to facilitate  differentiation in neurotics it is suggested that the production of 
fantasies be encouraged the theory behind this techni que is explained if the unconscious has gained an 
ascendancy over the consciou s the strength of the former can be sapped by funneling its energy into the 
production of fantasies this conti nual conscious realization of uncons cious fantasies extends conscious 
horizons by the inclusion of unconscious contents a nd gradually diminishes the dominant influence of 
the unconscious only by dissolving autonomous complexes such as the anima can the individual come 
to terms with his unconscious two case studies are presented to document the therapeutic effects of 
fantasy production it is stressed that the patient must  take his fantasies literally participate in them 
actively and thereby derive the maximum therapeuti c benefit the analyst however is cautioned to 
ignore the literal content of the fantasies and to pr obe beneath them in order to discover the underlying 
operative processes

personality  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  nd ed princeton university press 
  p p   
the formation and characteristics of  the mana personality a stage of development that follows the 
transformation and dissolution of  the anima as an autonomous co mplex are described the power 
mana that infused the anima is  often usurped by the ego as a consequence the individual feels 
mistakenly that he has vanquished the unconscious and that his new knowledge of it will give him 
power hence he perceive s himself as a wise and powerful man this selfconcept termed the mana 
personality is a flat collective figure as are all archetype dominated persona lities consequently it 
restricts the individuals growth in  order to continue to develop the individual must go through the 
process of differentiating the ego from the mana pe rsonality this involves bringing those contents of 
the unconscious specific to the ma na personality to consciousness the danger of identifying or 
concretizing the contents of the mana personality into a god are pointed out with goethes faust and 
nietzsches zarathustra cited as attempts to master  the contents of the mana personality since these 
approaches are obviously not suited to the man who lives in the real world the assimilation of the 
contents of the mana personality into  the conscious mind is seen as th e best solution the results will be 
the formation of the concept of self a psychological construct akin to the religious concept of the god 
within us  references

psychology and what it could deliver  sigmund freud is cited as the father of analytic psychology and 
credited with fashioning its most valuable tool   dream analysis a detailed case history involving a 
neurotic disorder in a young woman is  used to demonstrate the concept that neurosis originates in a 
disturbance in the psyche the explication of the roots of the womans neurosis illustrates how the 
trauma theory of neurosis came to be replaced by the erotic conflict theory th e recognition of repressed 
sexual impulses and the resultant tension between the conscious and the onconscious as the most 
frequent cause of neurosis is held to be an im portant breakthrough for psyc hological theorylikewise 
dream anal ysis is seen as an advance over h ypnotism and free association in the area of anal ytic

development of jungs theory wa s aided by his split from the viennese school of psychology an 
argument against freuds conception of the unconscious as a mere receptacle for repressed incompatible 
sexual impulses is presented according to freud by m eans of analysis the repressions would be lifted 
rendering conscious the contents of  the unconscious as a result fre ud believed the unconscious would 
wither and disappear but since this never occurs the unconscious must contain more material than 
previously thought and perform more than a repressive function it is suggested that the unconscious 
contains all the psychic materials that have fallen below the threshold of cons ciousness the subliminal 
sense perceptions and material that has not yet reached  consciousness these last are the seeds of future 
conscious contents it is held that the unconscious  is never quiescent but always producing unconscious 
fantasies that stand in a compensatory relation to conscious thoughts the personal unconscious is 
defined as that layer of the unconscious that contai ns the unconscious material and processes that were 
acquired in the course of the individuals life a ca se history of a youth who develops a psychosis as a

different reactions to the process of assimilation are discussed along with the role of the collective 
psyche in primitive and modern soci eties the process of assimilation gives rise to some remarkable 
phenomena some patie nts display an increase of selfconfidence while others become markedly 
depressed analysis of thes e two reactions reveals that they are but masks for a feeling of helplessness 
and the will to power respectively the feeling of godlikeness seen in some patients is further 
dissected to discover its source the feeling derive s from a certain psychic function of a collective 
nature that is superordinate to the individual th e collective psyche is the original basis for the 
individual psyche modern man as opposed to prim itive man has been able to differentiate his 
individual psyche from the collecti ve if however during analysis parts of the collective unconscious 
are annexed to the conscious mind the personality w ill inevitably begin to dissolve into its paired 
opposites the collective psyche c ontains good and evil in undifferen tiated form only with the 
development of the individual modern mind does a distinction between the two and the resultant 
repression of evil occur repression of the collecti ve psyche was necessary for the development of the 
civilized personality the danger is  that during analysis the collective unconscious may become 
dominant for this reason analysts are cautioned to  remember that the goal of analysis is the 
development of personality which requires that a clear distinction between the contents of the personal 
and the collective unconscious must always be maintained  reference

a distinction is made between persona and the conscious mind and the difference between 
schizophrenic investment in the un conscious and analytic release of the collectiv e psyche is explained 
analytic experience reveals that the conscious mi nd is only an arbitrary segment of the collective 
psyche it exists because it is i gnorant of the universal characteristics  of hurnamty in addition it has 
repressed more or less arbitrarily psychic elements awareness of whic h might be useful this arbitrary 
segment of consciousness is termed the persona and though it feigns individualit y it really is no more 
than a mask worn by the collective psyche during an alysis this mask is stripped off and the individual 
is seen to be at bottom collective the analysand s perception of his collectiv eness gives rise to the 
feeling of godlikeness this feeling is characteri zed by dreams of flying and growth disorientation in 
regard to ones identity and the release of unconscious  fantasies this state bor ders on and is analogous 
to schizophrenia in schizophrenia the unconscious us urps the reality function  unconscious thoughts are 
heard as though they were voices a nd fantasies are seen as though th ey were real objects during 
analysis however the patient is aware that he is calling up the unc onscious and does not invest its 
contents with an objective reality

two common reactions to the initial awareness of  identification with the collective psyche are 
discussed the feeling that results fr om awareness of the condition of godlikeness drives the patient to 
seek relief two common escape m echanisms are regressive re storation of the persona and 
identification with the collective psyc he the first solution results in th e reestablishment of the previous 
persona and is thus regressive here the unconsci ous is mastered by a reductionist analysis of its 
contents allowing them to be reject ed categorically as mere infantile sexuality or will to power this 
solution retards growth and does nothing to diminish  the influence of the unconscious on the conscious 
the second solution entails accepting th e godlikeness so totally that it  becomes a part of the self and 
thus is no longer threatening such identification is  always a retrograde step  the patient forfeits his 
chance to use the treasures of the collective psyche by becoming identified wi th them  reference

the essence of which is the categorical denial of all that is not already known or understood the human 
psyche however is both individual and collective to attempt to divide the two is pointless and 
impossible what the analyst must ask himself is what  is it at this moment and in this patient that 
represents the natural urges of life the answer  can only come from observing those psychological 
germs of life that are born from the natural collaboration of the conscious and the unconscious on the 
one hand and of the individual and the collective on th e other creative fantasies not dreams perform
