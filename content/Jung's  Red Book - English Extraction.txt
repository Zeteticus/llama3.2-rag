c g jung is widely recognized as a major figure in modern western 
thought and his work continues to spark controversies he played critical 
roles in the formation of modern psychology psychotherapy and psychiatry 
and a large international profession of analytical psychologists worl 
under his name his worl has had its widest impact however outside 
professional circles j ung and freud are the names that most people first 
thinl of in connection with psychology and their ideas have been widely 
disseminated in the arts the humanities films and popular culture jung 
is also widely regarded as one of the instigators of the new age movement 
however it is startling to realize that the bool that stands at the center 
of his oeuvre on which he worked for over sixteen years is only now 
being published 
there can be few unpublished works that have already exerted such 
farreaching effects upon twentiethcentury social and intellectual history 
as jungs red book or liber novus new book nominated by jung to 
contain the nucleus of his later works it has long been recognized as 
the ley to comprehending their genesis yet aside from a few tantalizing 
glimpses it has remained unavailable for study 
i the following draws at times directly on my reconstruction of the formation of jungs psychology in jung and the making of modern psychology the dream of a science 
cambridge cambridge university press  jung referred to the work both as liber novus and as the red book as it has become generally known because there 
are indications that the former is its actual title i have referred to it as such throughout for consistency

 i liber novus 
the cultural moment 
the first few decades of the twentieth century saw a grpt deal 
of experimentation in literature psychology and the visual arts 
  
writers tried to throw off the limitations of representational 
conventions to explore and depict the full range of inner 
experiencedreams visions and fantasies they experimented 
with new forms and utilized old forms in novel ways from the 
automatic writing of the surrealists to the gothic fantasies of 
gustav meyrink writers came into close proximity and collision 
with the researches of psychologists who were engaged in similar 
explorations artists and writers collaborated to try out new 
forms of illustration and typography new configurations of text 
and image psychologists sought to overcome the limitations of 
philosophical psychology and they began to explore the same 
terrain as artists and writers clear demarcations among literature 
art and psychology had not yet been set writers and artists 
borrowed from psychologists and vice versa a number of 
major psychologists such as alfred binet and charles richet 
wrote dramatic and fictional works often under assumed names 
whose themes mirrored those of their scientific works gustav 
fechner one of the founders of psychophysics and experimental 
psychology wrote on the soul life of plants and of the earth 
as a blue ange  meanwhile writers such as andre breton and 
philippe soupault assiduously read and utilized the works of 
psychical researchers and abnormal psychologists such as 
frederick myers theodore flournoy and pierre janet w b 
yeats utilized spiritualistic automatic writing to compose a 
poetic psycho cosmology in a vision  on all sides individuals 
were searching for new forms with which to depict the actualities 
of inner experience in a quest for spiritual and cultural renewal 
in berlin hugo ball noted 
the world and society in  looked like this life is 
completely confined and shackled a kind of economic 
fatalism prevails each individual whether he resists it 
or not is assigned a specific role and with it his interests 
and his character the church is regarded as a redemption 
factory of little importance literature as a safety valve    
the most burning question day and night is is there any
where a force that is strong enough to put an end to this 
state of affairs and if not how can one escape its 
within this cultural crisis jung conceived of undertaking an 
extended process of selfexperimentation which resulted in liber 
novus a work of psychology in a literary form 
we stand today on the other side of a divide between psychology 
and literature to consider liber novus today is to take up a work 
that could have emerged only before these separations had been 
firmly established its study helps us understand how the divide 
occurred but first we may ask who was c g jung 
jung was born in kesswil on lake constance in  his family 
moved to laufen by the rhine falls when he was six months 
old he was the oldest child and had one sister his father was a 
pastor in the swiss reformed church toward the end of his life 
jung wrote a memoir entitled from the earliest experiences of 
my life which was subsequently included in memories dreams 
riflections in a heavily edited form jung narrated the significant 
events that led to his psychological vocation the memoir with 
its focus on significant childhood dreams visions and fantasies 
can be viewed as an introduction to liber novus 
in the first dream he found himself in a meadow with a 
stonelined hole in the ground finding some stairs he descended 
into it and found himself in a chamber here there was a golden 
throne with what appeared to be a tree trunk of skin and flesh 
with an eye on the top he then heard his mothers voice exclaim 
that this was the maneater he was unsure whether she meant 
that this figure actually devoured children or was identical with 
christ this profoundly affected his image of christ years later 
he realized that this figure was a penis and later still that it was 
in fact a ritual phallus and that the setting was an underground 
temple he came to see this dream as an initiation in the secrets 
of the earth 
in his childhood jung experienced a number of visual 
hallucinations he also appears to have had the capacity to evoke 
images voluntarily in a seminar in  he recalled a portrait of 
his maternal grandmother which he would look at as a boy until 
he saw his grandfather descending the stairs  
one sunny day when jung was twelve he was traversing the 
mtinsterplatz in basel admiring the sun shining on the newly 
restored glazed roof tiles of the cathedral he then felt the 
approach of a terrible sinful thought which he pushed away he 
was in a state of anguish for several days finally after convincing 
himself that it was god who wanted him to think this thought 
just as it had been god who had wanted adam and eve to sin he 
let himself contemplate it and saw god on his throne unleashing 
an almighty turd on the cathedral shattering its new roof and 
smashing the cathedral with this jung felt a sense of bliss and 
relief such as he had never experienced before he felt that it was 
an experience of the direct living god who stands omnipotent 
and free above the bible and church he felt alone before god 
and that his real responsibility commenced then he realized that 
it was precisely such a direct immediate experience of the living 
god who stands outside church and bible that his father lacked 
this sense of election led to a final disillusionment with the 
church on the occasion of his first communion he had been 
led to believe that this would be a great experience instead 
nothing he concluded for me it was an absence of god and no 
religion church was a place to which i no longer could go there 
was no life there but deatho

jungs voracious reading started at this time and he was 
particularly struck by goethes faust he was struck by the fact 
that in mephistopheles goethe took the figure of the devil 
seriously in philosophy he was impressed by schopenhauer 
who acknowledged the existence of evil and gave voice to the 
sufferings and miseries of the world 
jung also had a sense of living in two centuries and felt a strong 
nostalgia for the eighteenth century his sense of duality took the 
form of two alternating personalities which he dubbed no 
and  no was the basel schoolboy who read novels and no 
pursued religious reflections in solitude in a state of communion 
with nature and the cosmos he inhabited gods world this 
personality felt most real personality no wanted to be free of the 
melancholy and isolation of personality no when personality 
no entered it felt as if a long dead yet perpetually present 
spirit had entered the room no had no definable character he 
was connected to history particularly with the middle ages for 
no no i with his failings and ineptitudes was someone to 
be put up with this interplay ran throughout jungs life as he 
saw it we are all like thispart of us lives in the present and the 
other part is connected to the centuries 
as the time drew near for him to choose a career the conflict 
between the two personalities intensified no wanted to pur
sue science no the humanities jung then had two critical 
dreams in the first he was walking in a dark wood along the 
rhine he came upon a burial mound and began to dig until 
he discovered the remains of prehistoric animals this dream 
awakened his desire to learn more about nature in the second 
dream he was in a wood and there were watercourses he 
found a circular pool surrounded by dense undergrowth in the 
pool he saw a beautiful creature a large radiolarian after these 
dreams he settled for science to solve the question of how to 
earn a living he decided to study medicine he then had another 
dream he was in an unknown place surrounded by fog making 
slow headway against the wind he was protecting a small light 
from going out he saw a large black figure threateningly close 
he awoke and realized that the figure was the shadow cast from 
the light he thought that in the dream no was himself bearing 
the light and no followed like a shadow he took this as a sign 
that he should go forward with no i and not look back to the 
world of no 
in his university days the interplay between these personalities 
continued in addition to his medical studies jung pursued an 
intensive program of extracurricular reading in particular the 
works of nietzsche schopenhauer swedenborg ii and writers 
on spiritualism nietzsches thus spoke zarathustra made a great 
impression on him he felt that his own personality no 
corresponded to zarathustra and he feared that his personality 
no was similarly morbidi he participated in a student debating 
society the zofingia society and presented lectures on these 
subjects spiritualism particularly interested him as the spiritualists 
appeared to be attempting to use scientific means to explore the 
supernatural and prove the immortality of the soul introduction i  
the latter half of the nineteenth century witnessed the 
emergence of modern spiritualism which spread across europe 
and america through spiritualism the cultivation of trances
with the attendant phenomena of trance speech glossolalia 
automatic writing and crystal visionbecame widespread the 
phenomena of spiritualism attracted the interest of leading 
scientists such as crookes zollner and wallace it also attracted 
the interest of psychologists including freud ferenczi bleuler 
james myers janet bergson stanley hall schrenck notzing 
moll dessoir richet and flournoy 
during his university days in basel jung and his fellow students 
took part in seances in  they engaged in a long series 
of sittings with his cousin helene preiswerk who appeared to 
have mediumistic abilities jung found that during the trances 
she would become different personalities and that he could call 
up these personalities by suggestion dead relatives appeared 
and she became completely transformed into these figures she 
unfolded stories of her previous incarnations and articulated a 
mystical cosmology represented in a mandala her spiritualistic 
revelations carried on until she was caught attempting to fake 
physical apparitions and the seances were discontinued 
on reading richard von krafftebings textbook of psychiatry 
in  jung realized that his vocation lay in psychiatry which 
represented a fusion of the interests of his two personalities 
he underwent something like a conversion to a natural scientific 
framework after his medical studies he took up a post as an 
assistant physician at burgholzli hospital at the end of  
the burgholzli was a progressive university clinic under the 
directorship of eugen bleuler at the end of the nineteenth 
century numerous figures attempted to found a new scientific 
psychology it was held that by turning psychology into a science 
through introducing scientific methods all prior forms of human 
understanding would be revolutionized the new psychology was 
heralded as promising nothing less than the completion of the 
scientific revolution thanks to bleuler and his predecessor auguste 
forel psychological research and hypnosis played prominent roles 
at the burgholzli 
jungs medical dissertation focused on the psychogenesis of 
spiritualistic phenomena in the form of an analysis of his seances 
with helene preiswerk while his initial interest in her case appeared 
to be in the possible veracity of her spiritualistic manifestations in 
the interim he had studied the works of frederic myers william 
james and in particular theodore flournoy at the end of  
flournoy had published a study of a medium whom he called 
helene smith which became a best sellerlswhat was novel about 
flournoys study was that it approached her case purely from 
the psychological angle as a means of illuminating the study of 
subliminal consciousness a critical shift had taken place through 
the work of flournoy frederick myers and william james 
they argued that regardless of whether the alleged spiritualistic 
experiences were valid such experiences enabled farreaching 
insight into the constitution of the subliminal and hence into 
human psychology as a whole through them mediums became 
ii emmanuel swedenborg  was a swedish scientist and christian mystic in  he underwent a religious crisis which is depicted in hisournal of dreams 
in  he had a vision of christ he then devoted his life to relating what he had heard and seen in heaven and hell and learned from the angels and in interpreting 
the internal and symbolic meaning of the bible  swedenborg argued that the bible had two levels of meaning a physical literal level and an inner spiritual level 
these were linked by correspondences he proclaimed the advent of a new church that represented a new spiritual era according to swedenborg from birth one 
acquired evils from ones parents which are lodged in the natural man who is diametrically opposed to the spiritual man man is destined for heaven and he cannot 
reach there without spiritual regeneration and a new birth the means to this lay in charity and faith see eugene taylor jung on swedenborg redivivus

 i liber novus 
important subjects of the new psychology with this shift the 
methods used by the mediumssuch as automatic writing 
trance speech and crystal vision were appropriated by the 
psychologists and became prominent experimental research 
tools in psychotherapy pierre janet and morton prince used 
automatic writing and crystal gazing as methods for revealing 
hidden memories and subconscious fixed ideas automatic 
writing brought to light subpersonalities and enabled dialogues 
with them to be heldifor janet and prince the goal of holding 
such practices was to reintegrate the personality 
jung was so talen by flournoys book that he offered to 
translate it into german but flournoy already had a translator 
the impact of these studies is clear in jungs dissertation 
where he approaches the case purely from a psychological 
angle jungs work was closely modeled on flournoys from 
india to the planet mars both in terms of subject matter and in 
its interpretation of the psychogenesis of helenes spiritualistic 
romances jungs dissertation also indicates the manner in 
which he was utilizing automatic writing as a method of 
psychological investigation 
in  he became engaged to emma rauschenbach whom 
he married and with whom he had five children up till this 
point jung had kept a diary in one of the last entries dated 
may  he wrote i am no longer alone with mysel and i can 
only artificially recall the scary and beautiful feeling of solitude 
this is the shadow side of the fortune of love for jung his 
marriage marked a move away from the solitude to which he had 
been accustomed 
in his youth jung had often visited basels art museum and 
was particularly drawn to the works of holbein and bocklin as 
well as to those of the dutch painters is toward the end of his 
studies he was much occupied with painting for about a year his 
paintings from this period were landscapes in a representational 
style and show highly developed technical skills and fine technical 
proficiencyi in  jung left his post at the burgholzli and 
went to paris to study with the leading french psychologist pierre 
janet who was lecturing at the college de france during his 
stay he devoted much time to painting and visiting museums 
going frequently to the louvre he paid particular attention to 
ancient art egyptian antiquities the works of the renaissance 
fra angelico leonardo da vinci rubens and frans hals he 
bought paintings and engravings and had paintings copied for 
the furnishing of his new home he painted in both oil and 
watercolor in january  he went to london and visited its 
museums paying particular attention to the egyptian aztec 
and inca collections at the british museun 
after his return he took up a post that had become vacant 
at the burgholzi and devoted his research to the analysis of 
linguistic associations in collaboration with franz rildin 
with coworkers they conducted an extensive series of 
experiments which they subjected to statistical analyses 
the conceptual basis of jungs early work lay in the work 
of flournoy and janet which he attempted to fuse with the research methodology of wilhelm wundt and emil kraepelin 
jung nd riklin utilized the associations experiment devised 
by francis galton and developed in psychology and psychiatry by 
wundt kraepelin and gustav aschaffenburg the aim of the 
research project instigated by bleuler was to provide a quick 
and reliable means for differential diagnosis the burgholzli 
team failed to come up with this but they were struck by the 
significance of disturbances of reaction and prolonged response 
times jung and rildin argued that these disturbed reactions 
were due to the presence of emotionally stressed complexes 
and used their experiments to develop a general psychology 
of complexes 
this work established jungs reputation as one of the rising 
stars of psychiatry in  he applied his new theory of complexes 
to study the psychogenesis of dementia praecox later called 
schizophrenia and to demonstrate the intelligibility of delusional 
formations for jung along with a number of other psychiatrists 
and psychologists at this time such as janet and adolf meyer 
insanity was not regarded as something completely set apart 
from sanity but rather as lying on the extreme end of a spectrum 
two years later he argued that if we feel our way into the human 
secrets of the sick person the madness also reveals its system and 
we recognize in the mental illness merely an exceptional reaction 
to emotional problems which are not strange to us 
jung became increasingly disenchanted by the limitations of 
experimental and statistical methods in psychiatry and psychology 
in the outpatient clinic at the burgholzli he presented hypnotic 
demonstrations this led to his interest in therapeutics and to the 
use of the clinical encounter as a method of research around 
 bleuler introduced psychoanalysis into the burgholzli 
and entered into a correspondence with freud asking freud 
for assistance in his analysis of his own dreams in  jung 
entered into communication with freud this relationship 
has been much mythologized a freudocentric legend arose 
which viewed freud and psychoanalysis as the principalsource 
for jungs work this has led to the complete mislocation of 
his work in the intellectual history of the twentieth century 
on numerous occasions jung protested for instance in an 
unpublished article written in the s the schism in the 
freudian schoo he wrote i in no way exclusively stem from 
freud i had my scientific attitude and the theory of complexes 
before i met freud the teachers that influenced me above all 
are bleuler pierre janet and theodore flournoy freud and 
jung clearly came from quite different intellectual traditions 
and were drawn together by shared interests in the psychogenesis 
of mental disorders and psychotherapy their intention was to 
form a scientific psychotherapy based on the new psychology 
and in turn to ground psychology in the indepth clinical 
investigation of individual lives

was established with bleuler and freud editorsinchief and jung 
as managing editor due to their advocacy psychoanalysis gained 
a hearing in the german psychiatric world in  jung received 
an honorary degree from clark university for his association 
researches the following year an international psychoanalytic 
association was formed with jung as the president during the 
period of his collaboration with freud he was a principal architect 
of the psychoanalytic movement for jung this was a period of 
intense institutional and political activity the movement was 
riven by dissent and acrimonious disagreements 
the intoxication 
of mythology 
in  jung bought some land by the shore of lake zurich in 
kusnacht and had a house built where he was to live for the rest 
of his life in  he resigned from the burgholzli to devote 
himself to his growing practice and his research interests his 
retirement from the burgholzli coincided with a shift in his 
research interests to the study of mythology folklore and religion 
and he assembled a vast private library of scholarly works these 
researches culminated in transformations and symbols of the libido 
published in two installments in iii and  this work can be 
seen to mark a return to jungs intellectual roots and to his cultural 
and religious preoccupations he found the mythological work 
exciting and intoxicating in  he recalled it seemed to me 
i was living in an insane asylum of my own making i went about 
with all these fantastic figures centaurs nymphs satyrs gods and 
goddesses as though they were patients and i was analyzing them 
i read a greek or a negro myth as if a lunatic were telling me 
his anamnesis the end of the nineteenth century had seen 
an explosion of scholarship in the newly founded disciplines 
of comparative religion and ethnopsychology primary texts 
were collected and translated for the first time and subjected 
to historical scholarship in collections such as max miillers 
sacred books of the ease for many these works represented an 
important relativization of the christian worldview 
in transformations and symbols of the libido jung differentiated 
two kinds of thinking taking his cue from william james among 
others jung contrasted directed thinking and fantasy thinking 
the former was verbal and logical while the latter was passive 
associative and imagistic the former was exemplified by science 
and the latter by mythology jung claimed that the ancients lacked 
a capacity for directed thinking which was a modern acquisition 
fantasy thinking took place when directed thinking ceased 
traniformations and symbols of the libido was an extended study of 
fantasy thinking and of the continued presence of mythological 
themes in the dreams and fantasies of contemporary individuals 
jung reiterated the anthropological equation of the prehistoric 
the primitive and the child he held that the elucidation of 
currentday fantasy thinking in adults would concurrently shed 
light on the thought of children savages and prehistoric peoples 
in this work jung synthesized nineteenthcentury theories of 
memory heredity and the unconscious and posited a phylogenetic 
layer to the unconscious that was still present in everyone consisting 
 analytical psychology p  
 jung possessed a complete set of this introduction i  
of mythological images for jung myths were symbols of the libido 
and they depicted its typical movements he used the compara
tive method of anthropology to draw together a vast panoply of 
myths and then subjected them to analytic interpretation he 
later termed his use of the comparative method amplification 
he claimed that there had to be typical myths which corresponded 
to the ethnopsychological development of complexes following 
jacob burckhardt jung termed such typical myths primordial 
images urbilder one particular myth was given a central role 
that of the hero for jung this represented the life of the individual 
attempting to become independent and to free himself from 
the mother he interpreted the incest motif as an attempt to return 
to the mother to be reborn he was later to herald this work as 
marking the discovery of the collective unconscious though the 
term itself came at a later date 
in a series of articles from  jungs friend and colleague 
alphonse maeder argued that dreams had a function other than 
that of wish fulfillment which was a balancing or compensatory 
function dreams were attempts to solve the individuals moral 
conflicts as such they did not merely point to the past but 
also prepared the way for the future maeder was developing 
flournoys views of the subconscious creative imagination jung 
was working along similar lines and adopted maeders positions 
for jung and maeder this alteration of the conception of the 
dream brought with it an alteration of all other phenomena 
associated with the unconscious 
in his preface to the  revision of transformations and symbols 
of the libido jung wrote that the work was written in iii when 
he was thirtysix the time is a critical one for it marks the 
beginning of the second half of life when a metanoia a mental 
transformation not infrequently occurs he added that he 
was conscious of the loss of his collaboration with freud and 
was indebted to the support of his wife after completing the 
work he realized the significance of what it meant to live without 
a myth one without a myth is like one uprooted having no 
true link either with the past or with the ancestral life which 
continues within him or yet with contemporary human society 
as he further describes it 
i was driven to ask myself in all seriousness what is the myth 
you are living i found no answer to this question and had to 
admit that i was not living with a myth or even in a myth but 
rather in an uncertain cloud of theoretical possibilities 
which i was beginning to regard with increasing distrust  
so in the most natural way i took it upon myself to get 
to know my myth and i regarded this as the task of 
tasksforso i told myselfhow could  when treating 
my patients malce due allowance for the personal factor 
for my personal equation which is yet so necessary for a 
knowledge of the other person if i was unconscious of it 
the study of myth had revealed to jung his mythlessness he then 
undertook to get to know his myth his personal equation thus 
we see that the selfexperimentation which jung undertook was in 
part a direct response to theoretical questions raised by his research 
which had culminated in transformations and symbols of the libido

 i liber novus 
my most difficult 
experilllen t 
in  jung had some significant dreams that he did not 
understand he gave particular importance to two of these 
which he felt showed the limitations of freuds conceptions of 
dreams the first follows 
i was in a southern town on a rising street with narrow half 
landings it was twelve oclock middaybright sunshine 
an old austrian customs guard or someone similar passes 
by me lost in thought someone says that is one who cannot 
die he died already  years ago but has not yet managed 
to decompose i was very surprised here a striking figure 
came a knight of powerful build clad in yellowish armor 
he looks solid and inscrutable and nothing impresses him 
on his back he carries a red maltese cross he has continued 
to exist from the th century and daily between  and  
oclock midday he takes the same route no one marvels at 
these two apparitions but i was extremely surprised 
i hold back my interpretive skills as regards the old austrian 
freud occurred to me as regards the knight i myself 
inside a voice calls it is all empty and disgusting i 
must bear it 
jung found this dream oppressive and bewildering and freud 
was unable to interpret it around half a year later jung had 
another dream 
i dreamt at that time it was shortly after christmas  
that i was sitting with my children in a marvelous and richly 
furnished castle apartmentan open columned hallwe 
were sitting at a round table whose top was a marvelous 
dark green stone suddenly a gull or a dove flew in and 
sprang lightly onto the table i admonished the children 
to be quiet so that they would not scare away the beautiful 
white bird suddenly this bird turned into a child of eight 
years a small blond girl and ran around playing with my 
children in the marvelous columned colonnades then the 
child suddenly turned into the gull or dove she said the 
following to me only in the first hour of the night can i become 
human while the male dove is busy with the twelve dead with these 
words the bird flew away and i awoke 
 black book  pp  in black book  jung noted that it was this dream that made 
him decide to embark on a relationship with a woman he had 
met three years earlier toni wolff in  he remarked 
that this dream was the beginning of a conviction that the 
unconscious did not consist of inert material only but that there 
was something living down there he added that he thought 
of the story of the tabula smaragdina emerald tablet the twelve 
apostles the signs of the zodiac and so on but that he could make 
nothing out of the dream except that there was a tremendous 
animation of the unconscious i knew no technique of getting at the 
bottom of this activity all i could do was just wait keep on living 
and watch the fantasies these dreams led him to analyze his 
childhood memories but this did not resolve anything he realized 
that he needed to recover the emotional tone of childhood he 
recalled that as a child he used to like to build houses arid other 
structures and he took this up again 
while he was engaged in this selfanalytic activity he continued 
to develop his theoretical work at the munich psychoanalytical 
congress in september  he spoke on psychological types 
he argued that there were two basic movements of the libido 
extraversion in which the subjects interest was oriented toward 
the outer world and introversion in which the subjects interest 
was directed inward following from this he posited two types 
of people characterized by a predominance of one of these 
tendencies the psychologies of freud and adler were examples 
of the fact that psychologies often took what was true of their 
type as generally valid hence what was required was a psychology 
that did justice to both of these types 
the following month on a train journey to schaffhausen 
jung experienced a waking vision of europe being devastated 
by a catastrophic flood which was repeated two weeks later on 
the same journey commenting on this experience in  he 
remarked i could be taken as switzerland fenced in by mountains 
and the submergence of the world could be the debris of my 
former relationships this led him to the following diagnosis 
of his condition i thought to mysel if this means anything 
it means that i am hopelessly off after this experience jung

that the images of the vision indicated a revolution but as he 
could not imagine this he concluded that he was menaced with

said that i had no thoughts but saw blood rivers ofblood 
in the years directly preceding the outbreak of war apocalyptic 
imagery was widespread in european arts and literature for 
example in  wassily kandinsky wrote of a coming universal 
catastrophe from  to  ludwig meidner painted a series 
of works known as the apocalyptic landscapes with scenes of 
destroyed cities corpses and turmoil prophecy was in the air 
in  the famous american medium leonora piper predicted 
that in the coming century there would be a terrible war in different 
parts of the world that would cleanse the world and reveal the 
truths of spiritualism in  arthur conan doyle the spiritualist 
and author of the sherlock holmes stories viewed this as having 
been propheticy 
in jungs account of the fantasy on the train in liber novus the 
inner voice said that what the fantasy depicted would become 
completely real initially he interpreted this subjectively and 
prospectively that is as depicting the imminent destruction of his 
world his reaction to this experience was to undertake a psycho
logical investigation of himself in this epoch selfexperimentation 
was used in medicine and psychology introspection had been one 
of the main tools of psychological research 
jung came to realize that transformations and symbols oj the 
libido could be taken as myself and that an analysis of it leads 
inevitably into an analysis of my own unconscious processes 
he had projected his material onto that of miss frank miller 
whom he had never met up to this point jung had been an active 
thinker and had been averse to fantasy as a form of thinking i 
held it to be altogether impure a sort of incestuous intercourse 
thoroughly immoral from an intellectual viewpoint he now 
turned to analyze his fantasies carefully noting everything and 
had to overcome considerable resistance in doing this permitting 
fantasy in myself had the same effect as would be produced on a 
man if he came into his workshop and found all the tools flying 
about doing things independently of his will  in studying his 
fantasies jung realized that he was studying the mythcreating 
function of the mind 
jung picked up the brown notebook which he had set aside 
in  and began writing in it he noted his inner states in 
metaphors such as being in a desert with an unbearably hot sun 
that is consciousness in the  seminar he recalled that 
it occurred to him that he could write down his reflections 
in a sequence he was writing autobiographical material 
but not as an autobiography from the time of the platonic 
 draft p  introduction i  
dialogues onward the dialogical form has been a prominent 
genre in western philosophy in  ce st augustine wrote 
his soliloquies which presented an extended dialogue between 
himself and reason who instructs him they commenced with 
the following lines 
when i had been pondering many different things to 
myself for a long time and had for many days been seeking 
my own self and what my own good was and what evil was 
to be avoided there suddenly spoke to mewhat was it i 
myself or someone else inside or outside me this is the very 
thing i would love to know but dont 
while jung was writing in black book  
i said to myself what is this i am doing it certainly is 
not science what is it then a voice said to me that is 
art this made the strangest sort of impression upon me 
because it was not in any sense my impression that what 
i was writing was art then i came to this perhaps my 
unconscious is forming a personality that is not  but which 
is insisting on coming through to expression i dont know 
why exactly but i knew to a certainty that the voice that 
had said my writing was art had come from a woman  well 
i said very emphatically to this voice that what i was doing 
was not art and i felt a great resistance grow up within me 
no voice came through however and i kept on writing 
this time i caught her and said no it is not and i felt as 
though an argument would ensue  
he thought that this voice was the soul in the primtve 
sense which he called the anima the latin word for soul 
he stated that in putting down all this material for analysis i 
was in effect writing letters to my anima that is part of myself 
with a different viewpoint from my own i got remarks of a 
new characteri was in analysis with a ghost and a woman 
in retrospect he recalled that this was the voice of a dutch 
patient whom he knew from  to  who had persuaded 
a psychiatrist colleague that he was a misunderstood artist the 
woman had thought that the unconscious was art but jung had 
maintained that it was nature i have previously argued that the 
woman in questionthe only dutch woman in jungs circle at 
this timewas maria moltzer and that the psychiatrist in question 
was jungs friend and colleague franz riklin who increasingly 
forsook analysis for painting in  he became a student of 
augusto giacomettis the uncle of alberto giacometti and an 
important early abstract painter in his own right

 i liber novus 
the november entries in black book  depict jungs sense of his 
return to his soul he recounted the dreams that led him to opt 
for his scientific career and the recent dreams that had brought 
him back to his soul as he recalled in  this first period of 
writing came to an end in november not knowing what would 
come next i thought perhaps more introspection was needed  
i devised such a boring method by fantasizing that i was digging 
a hole and by accepting this fantasy as perfectly real the first 
such experiment took place on december  
as indicated jung had had extensive experience studying 
mediums in trance states during which they were encouraged 
to produce waking fantasies and visual hallucinations and had 
conducted experiments with automatic writing practices of 
visualization had also been used in various religious traditions 
for example in the fifth of the spiritual exercises of st ignatius 
of loyola individuals are instructed on how to see with the eyes 
of the imagination the length breadth and depth of hell and to 
experience this with full sensory immediacy swedenborg also 
engaged in spirit writing in his spiritual diary one entry reads 
 jan spirits if permitted could possess those 
who speak with them so utterly that they would be as 
though they were entirely in the world and indeed in a 
manner so manifest that they could communicate their 
thoughts through their medium and even by letters 
for they have sometimes and indeed often directed my 
tand when writing as though it were quite their own so 
that they thought it was not i but themselves writing 
from  onward in vienna the psychoanalyst herbert silberer 
conducted experiments on himself in hypnagogic states 
silberer attempted to allow images to appear these images 
he maintained presented symbolic depictions of his previous 
train of thought silberer corresponded with jung and sent him 
offprints of his articles  
in  ludwig staudenmaier  a professor 
of experimental chemistry published a work entitled magic 
as an experimental science staudenmaier had embarked on self
experimentations in  commencing with automatic writing 
a series of characters appeared and he found that he no longer 
needed to write to conduct dialogues with them he also induced 
acoustic and visual hallucinations the aim of his enterprise 
was to use his selfexperimentation to provide a scientific 
explanation of magic he argued that the key to understanding 
magic lay in the concepts of hallucinations and the under 
consciousness unterbewufltsein and gave particular importance 
 analytical psychology p  to the role of personifications thus we see that jungs procedure 
closely resembled a number of historical and contemporary 
practices with which he was familiar 
from december  onward he carried on in the same 
procedure deliberately evoking a fantasy in a waking state and 
then entering into it as into a drama these fantasies may be 
understood as a type of dramatized thinking in pictorial form in 
reading his fantasies the impact of jungs mythological studies is 
clear some of the figures and conceptions derive directly from 
his readings and the form and style bear witness to his fascination 
with the world of myth and epic in the black books jung wrote 
down his fantasies in dated entries together with reflections on 
his state of mind and his difficulties in comprehending the fantasies 
the black books are not diaries of events and very few dreams are 
noted in them rather they are the records of an experiment in 
december  he referred to the first of the black books as the 
book of my most difficult experiment  
in retrospect he recalled that his scientific question was to see 
what took place when he switched off consciousness the example 
of dreams indicated the existence of background activity and he 
wanted to give this a possibility of emerging just as one does 
when taking mescalin 
in an entry in his dream book on april  jung noted 
since then frequent exercises in the emptying of consciousness 
his procedure was clearly intentionalwhile its aim was to 
allow psychic contents to appear spontaneously he recalled 
that beneath the threshold of consciousness everything was 
animated at times it was as if he heard something at other 
times he realized that he was whispering to himself 
from november  to the following july he remained uncertain 
of the meaning and significance of his undertaking and concerning 
the meaning of his fantasies which continued to develop during 
this time philemon who would prove to be an important figure in 
subsequent fantasies appeared in a dream jung recounted 
there was a blue sky like the sea covered not by clouds 
but by flat brown clods of earth it looked as if the clods 
were breaking apart and the blue water of the sea were 
becoming visible between them but the water was the blue 
sky suddenly there appeared from the right a winged being 
sailing across the sky i saw that it was an old man with the 
horns of a bull he held a bunch of four keys one of which 
he clutched as if he were about to open a lock he had the 
wings of the kingfisher with its characteristic colors since i 
did not understand this dream image i painted it in order 
to impress it upon my memory

while he was painting this image he found a dead kingfisher 
which is very rarely found in the vicinity of z urich in his garden 
by the lake shore 
the date of this dream is not dear the figure of philemon 
first appears in the black books on january   but with
out kingfisher wings to jung philemon represented superior 
insight and was like a guru to him he would converse with 
him in the garden he recalled that philemon evolved out of the 
figure of elijah who had previously appeared in his fantasies 
philemon was a pagan and brought with him an egypto
hellenic atmosphere with a gnostic coloration  it was he 
who taught me psychic objectivity the reality of the psyche 
through the conversations with philemon the distinction 
was clarified between myself and the object of my thought  
psychologically philemon represented superior insight 
on april  jung resigned as president of the international 
psychoanalytical association on april  he resigned asa lecturer 
in the medical faculty of the university of zurich he recalled 
that he felt that he was in an exposed position at the university 
and felt that he had to find a new orientation as it would otherwise 
be unfair to teach students in june and july he had a thrice
repeated dream of being in a foreign land and having to return 
home quicldy by ship followed by the descent of an icy cold 
on july  the zurich psychoanalytical society voted by 
 to i to leave the international psychoanalytic association 
in the minutes the reason given for the secession was that 
freud had established an orthodoxy that impeded free and 
independent research the group was renamed the association 
for analytical psychology jung was actively involved in this 
association which met fortnightly he also maintained a busy 
therapeutic practice between  and  he had between 
one and nine consultations per day five days a week with an 
average of between five and seven 
the minutes of the association for analytical psychology 
offer no indications of the process that jung was going through 
he does not refer to his fantasies and continues to discuss 
theoretical issues in psychology the same holds true in his 
surviving correspondences during this period each year he 
continued his military service duties thus he maintained his 
professional activities and familial responsibilities during the day 
and dedicated his evenings to his selfexplorations indications 
are that this partitioning of activities continued during the next 
few years jung recalled that during this period his family and 
profession always remained a joyful reality and a guarantee that 
i was normal and really existed 
the question of the different ways of interpreting such 
fantasies was the subject of a talk that he presented on july  
before the psychomedical society in london on psychological

understanding here he contrasted freuds analyticreductive 
method based on causality with the constructive method of the 
zurich school the shortcoming of the former was that through 
tracing things back to antecedent elements it dealt with only half 
of the picture and failed to grasp the living meaning of phenomena 
someone who attempted to understand goethes faust in such a 
manner would be like someone who tried to understand a gothic 
cathedral under its mineralogical aspect the living meaning 
only lives when we experience it in and through ourselves 
inasmuch as life was essentially new it could not be understood 
merely retrospectively hence the constructive standpoint asked 
how out of this present psyche a bridge can be built into its own 
future this paper implicitly presents jungs rationale for not 
embarking on a causal and retrospective analysis of his fantasies 
and serves as a caution to others who may be tempted to do so 
presented as a critique and reformulation of psychoanalysis jungs 
new mode of interpretation links back to the symbolic method of 
swedenborgs spiritual hermeneutics 
on july  jung gave a talk on the importance of the 
unconscious in psychopathology at a meeting of the british 
medical association in aberdeen he argued that in cases of 
neurosis and psychosis the unconscious attempted to compensate 
the onesided conscious attitude the unbalanced individual 
defends himself against this and the opposites become more 
polarized the corrective impulses that present themselves in the 
language of the unconscious should be the beginning of a healing 
process but the form in which they break through makes them 
unacceptable to consciousness 
a month earlier on june  archduke franz ferdinand 
the heir to the austrohungarian empire was assassinatedby 
gavrilo princip a nineteenyearold serb student on august i 
war broke out in  jung recalled i had the feeling that i was 
an overcompensated psychosis and from this feeling i was not 
released till august st  years later he said to mircea eliade 
as a psychiatrist i became worried wondering if i was 
not on the way to doing a schizophrenia as we said in 
the language of those days  i was just preparing a lecture 
on schizophrenia to be delivered at a congress in aberdeen 
and i kept saying to myself ill be speaking of myself very 
likely ill go mad after reading out this paper the congress 
was to take place in july exactly the same period 
when i saw myself in my three dreams voyaging on the 
southern seas on july r immediately after my lecture 
i learned from the newspapers that war had broken out 
finally i understood and when i disembarked in holland 
on the next day nobody was happier than  now i was 
sure that no schizophrenia was threatening me i under
stood that my dreams and my visions came to me from the 
subsoil of the collective unconscious what remained for

 i liber novus 
me to do now was to deepen and validate this discovery 
and this is what i have been trying to do for forty years 
at this moment jung considered that his fantasy had depicted 
not what would happen to him but to europe in other words 
that it was a precognition of a collective event what he would 
later call a big dream after this realization he attempted to 
see whether and to what extent this was true of the other fantasies 
that he experienced and to understand the meaning of this 
correspondence between private fantasies and public events 
this effort makes up much of the subject matter of liber novus 
in scrutinies he wrote that the outbreak of the war had enabled 
him to understand much of what he had previously experienced 
and had given him the courage to write the earlier part of liber 
novus thus he took the outbreak of the war as showing him 
that his fear of going mad was misplaced it is no exaggeration 
to say that had war not been declared liber novus would in 
all likelihood not have been compiled in  while discussing 
active imagination jung commented that the reason why 
the involvement looks very much like a psychosis is that the 
patient is integrating the same fantasymaterial to which the 
insane person falls victim because he cannot integrate it but is 
swallowed up by it  
it is important to note that there are around twelve separate 
fantasies that jung may have regarded as precognitive 
 october  
repeated vision of flood and death of thousands 
and the voice that said that this will become real 
 autumn  
vision of the sea of blood covering the northern lands 
 december    
image of a dead hero and the slaying of siegfried in a dream 
 december   
image of the foot of a giant stepping on a city and images 
of murder and bloody cruelty

 junejuly  
thricerepeated dream f being in a foreign land and having 
to return quickly by ship and the descent of the icy cold liber novus 
jung now commenced wfltlng the draft of liber novus he 
faithfully transcribed most of the fantasies from the black books 
and to each of these added a section explaining the significance of 
each episode combined with a lyrical elaboration wordbyword 
comparison indicates that the fantasies were faithfully reproduced 
with only minor editing and division into chapters thus the 
sequence of the fantasies in liber novus nearly always exactly 
corresponds to the black books when it is indicated that a 
particular fantasy happened on the next night etc this is 
always accurate and not a stylistic device the language and 
content of the material were not altered jung maintained 
a fidelity to the event and what he was writing was not to 
be mistaken for a fiction the draft begins with the address to my 
friends and this phrase occurs frequently the main difference 
between the black books and liber novus is that the former were 
written for jungs personal use and can be considered the records 
of an experiment while the latter is addressed to a public and 
presented in a form to be read by others 
in november  jung closely studied nietzsches thus spoke 
zarathustra which he had first read in his youth he later recalled 
then suddenly the spirit seized me and carried me to a desert 
country in which i read zarathustra it strongly shaped the 
structure and style of liber novus lilce nietzsche in zarathustra 
jung divided the material into a series of books comprised of 
short chapters but whereas zarathustra proclaimed the death of 
god libernovus depicts the rebirth of god in the soul there are 
also indications that he read dantes commedia at this time which 
also informs the structure of the work liber novus depicts jungs 
descent into hell but whereas dante could utilize an established 
cosmology liber n ovus is an attempt to shape an individual 
cosmology the role of philemon in jungs work has analogies to 
that of zarathustra in nietzsches work and virgil in dantes 
in the draft about  percent of the material is drawn directly 
from the black books there are about thirtyfive new sections of 
commentary in these sections he attempted to derive general 
psychological principles from the fantasies and to understand to 
what extent the events portrayed in the fantasies presented in a 
symbolic form developments that were to occur in the world in 
 jung had introduced a distinction between interpretation 
on the objective level in which dream objects were treated as 
representations of real objects and interpretation on the subjective 
level in which every element concerns the dreamers themselves 
as well as interpreting his fantasies on the subjective level one 
could characterize his procedure here as an attempt to interpret 
his fantasies on the collective level he does not try to interpret 
his fantasies reductively but sees them as depicting the functioning

of general psychological principles in him such as the relation 
of introversion to extraversion thinking and pleasure etc and 
as depicting literal or symbolic events that are going to happen 
thus the second layer of the draft represents the first major 
and extended attempt to develop and apply his new constructive 
method the second layer is itself a hermeneutic experiment 
in a critical sense liber novus does not require supplemental 
interpretation for it contains its own interpretation 
in writing the draft jung did not add scholarly references 
though unreferenced citations and allusions to works of philosophy 
religion and literature abound he had selfconsciously chosen to 
leave scholarship to one side yet the fantasies and the reflections 
on them in the red book are those of a scholar and indeed much 
of the selfexperimentation and the composition of liber n ovus 
took place in his library it is quite possible that he might have 
added references if he had decided to publish the work 
after completing the handwritten draft jung had it typed 
and edited it on one manuscript he made alterations by 
hand i refer to this manuscript as the corrected draft judging 
from the annotations it appears that he gave it to someone the 
handwriting is not that of emma jung toni wolff or maria moltzer 
to read who then commented on jungs editing indicating that 
some sections which he had intended to cut should be retained 
the first section of the workuntitled but effectively liber 
primuswas composed on parchment jung then commissioned a 
large folio volume of over  pages bound in red leather from 
the bookbinders emil stierli the spine bears the title liber novus 
he then inserted the parchment pages into the folio volume which 
continues with liber secundus the work is organized like a medieval 
illuminated manuscript with calligraphic writing headed by a table 
of abbreviations jung titled the first book the way of what is to 
come and placed beneath this some citations from the book of 
isaiah and from the gospel according to john thus it was presented 
as a prophetic work 
in the draft jung had divided the material into chapters 
in the course of the transcription into the red leather folio he 
altered some of the titles to the chapters added others and edited 
the material once again the cuts and alterations were predominantly 
to the second layer of interpretation and elaboration and not to 
the fantasy material itself and mainly consisted in shortening the 
text it is this second layer that jung continually reworked in the 
transcription of the text in this edition this second layer has been 
indicated so that the chronology and composition are visible as 
jungs comments in the second layer sometimes implicitly refer 
forward to fantasies that are found later in the text it is also 
helpful to read the fantasies straight through in chronological 
sequence followed by a continuous reading of the second layer 
jung then illustrated the text with some paintings historiated 
initials ornamental borders and margins initially the paintings 
refer directly to the text at a later point the paintings become introduction i  
more symbolic they are active imaginations in their own right 
the combination of text and image recalls the illuminated works 
of william blalce whose work jung had some familiarity with 
a preparatory draft of one of the images in liber n ovus has 
survived which indicates that they were carefully composed 
starting from pencil sketches that were then elaborated the 
composition of the other images likely followed a similar procedure 
from the paintings of jungs which have survived it is strilcing 
that they malce an abrupt leap from the representational landscapes 
of  to the abstract and semifigurative from  onward 
art and the zurich school 
jungs library today contains few books on modern art though 
some books were probably dispersed over the years he possessed 
a catalogue of the graphic works of odilon redon as well as a 
study ofhim he likely encountered redons work when he was 
in paris strong echoes of the symbolist movement appear in the 
paintings in liber n ovus 
in october of  jung went on a bicycle tour of northern 
italy together with his colleague hans schmid they visited 
ravenna and the frescos and mosaics there made a deep impression 
on him these works seemed to have had an impact on his paintings 
the use of strong colors mosaiclike forms and twodimensional 
figures without the use of perspective 
in  when he was in new york he likely attended the

of modern art in america the show ran to march  and jung 
left for new york on march  he referrd to marcel duchamps 
painting nude descending the stairs in his  seminar which had 
caused a furor thereioo here he also referred to having studied 
the course of picassos paintings given the lack of evidence of 
extended study jungs knowledge of modern art probably derived 
more immediately from direct acquaintance 
during the first world war there were contacts between 
the members of the zurich school and artists both were part 
of avantgarde movements and intersecting social circlesioi in  
erika schlegel came to jung for analysis she and her husband 
eugen schlegel had been friendly with toni wolff erika schlegel 
was sophie taeubers sister and became the librarian of the 
psychological club members of the psychological club were 
invited to some of the dada events at the celebration of the 
opening of the gallery dada on march  hugo ball notes

included abstract dances by sophie taeuber and poems by

 i liber novus 
freud analytikus opposed by dr oedipus complex is transformed 
into a parrot by the urlibido parodic ally talting up themes from 
jungs transformations and symbols of the libido and his conflict with 
freud however relations between jungs circle and some of the 
dadaists became more strained in may  emmy hennings 
wrote to hugo ball that the psychoclub had now gone awayios in 
 jung criticized the dada movement in a swiss review which 
did not escape the attention of the dadaistsiog the critical element 
that separated jungs pictorial work from that of the dadaists was his 
overriding emphasis on meaning and signification 
jungs selfexplorations and creative experiments did not 
occur in a vacuum during this period there was great interest in art 
and painting within his circle alphonse maeder wrote a monograph 
on ferdinand hodlerlo and had a friendly correspondence 
with himiob around  maeder had a series of visions or 
waking fantasies which he published pseudonymously when he 
told jung of these events jung replied what you too hans 
schmid also wrote and painted his fantasies in something akin to 
liber n ovus moltzer was keen to increase the artistic activities 
of the zurich school she felt that more artists were needed 
in their circle and considered riklin as a model j b lang 
who was analyzed byriklin began to paint symbolic paintings 
moltzer had a book that she called her bible in which she put 
pictures with writings she recommended that her patient 
fanny bowditch katz do the same thing iii 
in  riklin exhibited some of his paintings as part of the 
new life at the kunsthaus in zurich described as a group of 
swiss expressionists alongside hans arp sophie taeuber 
francis picabia and augusto giacometti ii with his personal 
connections jung could easily have exhibited some of his works 
in such a setting had he so liked thus his refusal to consider 
his works as art occurs in a context where there were quite real 
possibilities for him to have taken this route 
on some occasions jung discussed art with erika schlegel 
she noted the following conversation 
i wore my pearl medallion the pearl embroidery that sophie 
had made for me at jungs yesterday he liked it very much 
and it prompted him to talk animatedly about artfor almost 
an hour he discussed riklin one of augusto giacomettis 
students and observed that while his smaller works had a 
certain aesthetic value his larger ones simply dissolved 
indeed he vanished wholly in his art rendering him utterly 
intangible his work was like a wall over which water rippled 
he could therefore not analyze as this required one to be 
pointed and sharpedged like a knife he had fallen into art in a manner of speaking but art and science were no more 
than the servants of the creative spirit which is what must 
be served 
as regards my own work it was also a matter of malting 
out whether it was really art fairy tales and pictures had a 
religious meaning at bottom i too know that somehow 
and sometime it must reach peoplei 
for jung franz riklin appears to have been something like a 
doppelganger whose fate he was keen to avoid this statement 
also indicates jungs relativization of the status of art and science 
to which he had come through his selfexperimentation 
thus the making of liber novus was by no means a peculiar 
and idiosyncratic activity nor the product of a psychosis rather 
it indicates the close intersections between psychological and 
artistic experimentation with which many individuals were 
engaged at this time 
the collective experiment 
in  jung held a lengthy correspondence with his colleague 
hans schmid on the question of the understanding of psycho
logical types this correspondence gives no direct signs of jungs 
selfexperimentation and indicates that theories he developed 
during this period did not stem solely from his active imaginations 
but also in part consisted of conventional psychological theorizing ii 
on march  jung wrote to smith ely jeliffe 
i am still with the army in a little town where i have plenty 
of practical work and horseback riding  until i had to 
join the army i lived quietly and devoted my time to my 
patients and to my work i was especially working about 
the two types of psychology and about the synthesis of 
unconscious tendencies lis 
during his selfexplorations he experienced states of turmoil 
he recalled that he experienced great fear and sometimes had to 
hold the table to keep himself togetheriig and i was frequently 
so wrought up that i had to eliminate the emotions through yoga 
practices but since it was my purpose to learn what was going on 
within mysel i would do them only until i had calmed myself 
and could take up again the work with the unconsciousi 
he recalled that toni wolffhad become drawn into the process 
in which he was involved and was experiencing a similar stream 
of images jung found that he could discuss his experiences with 
her but she was disorientated and in the same mess lib likewise his

wife was unable to help him in this regard consequently he noted 
that i was able to endure at all was a case of brute forcei 
the psychological club had been founded at the beginning 
of ii through a gift of  swiss francs from edith 
rockefeller mccormick who had come to zurich to be analyzed 
by jung in ii at its inception it had approximately sixty 
members for jung the aim of the club was to study the relation 
of individuals to the group and to provide a naturalistic setting for 
psychological observation to overcome the limitations of oneto
one analysis as well as to provide a venue where patients could 
learn to adapt to social situations at the same time a professional 
body of analysts continued to meet together as the association 
for analytical psychologyo jung participated fully in both of 
these organizations 
jungs selfexperimentation also heralded a change in his analytic 
work he encouraged his patients to embark upon similar processes 
of selfexperimentation patients were instructed on how to conduct 
active imagination to hold inner dialogues and to paint their 
fantasies he took his own experiences as paradigmatic in the 
i seminar he noted i drew all my empirical material from my 
patients but the solution of the problem i drew frdm the inside 
from my observations of the unconscious processesii 
tina keller who was in analysis with jung from ii recalls 
that jung often spoke of himself and his own experiences 
in those early days when one arrived for the analytic 
hour the socalled red book often stood open on an 
easel in it dr jung had been painting or had just finished a 
picture sometimes he would show me what he had done and 
comment upon it the careful and precise work he put into 
these pictures and into the illuminated text that accompanied 
them were a testimony to the importance of this undertaking 
the master thus demonstrated to the student that psychic 
development is worth time and effort i 
in her analyses with jung and toni wolff keller conducted 
active imaginations and also painted far from being a solitary 
endeavor jungs confrontation with the unconscious was a collective 
one in which he took his patients along with him those around 
jung formed an avantgarde group engaged in a social experiment 
that they hoped would transform their lives and the lives of 
those around them 
the return of the dead 
amid the unprecedented carnage of the war the theme of the 
return of the dead was widespread such as in abel gances film 
jaccuse the death toll also led to a revival of interest in spiritual
ism mter nearly a year jung began to write again in the black books 
in ii with a further series of fantasies he had already completed 
the handwritten draft of liber primus and liber secundus at the 
beginning of ii jung experienced a striking series of parapsy
chological events in his house in i he narrated this event to 
cary de angulo later baynes she recorded it as follows 
ii memories p  introduction i  
one night your boy began to rave in his sleep and throw 
himself about saying he couldnt wake up finally your 
wife had to call you to get him quiet  this you could 
only do by cold cloths on himfinally he settled down and 
went on sleeping next morning he woke up remembering 
nothing but seemed utterly exhausted so you told him 
not to go to school he didnt ask why but seemed to take 
it for granted but quite unexpectedly he asked for paper 
and colored pencils and set to work to make the following 
picturea man was angling for fishes with hook and 
line in the middle of the picture on the left was the devil 
saying something to the man and your son wrote down 
what he said it was that he had come for the fisherman 
because he was catching his fishes but on the right was an 
angel who said no you cant take this man he is talcing 
only bad fishes and none of the good ones then after 
your son had made that picture he was quite content the 
same night two of your daughters thought that they had 
seen spooks in their rooms the next day you wrote out 
the sermons to the dead and you knew after that noth
ing more would disturb your family and nothing did of 
course i knew you were the fisherman in your sons pic
ture and you told me so but the boy didnt know it 
in memories jung recounted what followed 
around five oclock in the afternoon on sunday the front 
doorbell began ringing frantically  everyone immediately 
looked to see who was there but there was no one in sight 
i was sitting near the doorbell and not heard it but saw 
it moving we all simply stared at one another the atmosphere 
was thick believe me then i knew something had to happen 
the whole house was as if there was a crowd present 
crammed full of spirits they were packed deep right up 
to the door and the air was so thick it was scarcely possible 
to breathe as for myself i was all aquiver with the question 
for gods sake what in the world is this then they cried 
out in chorus we have come back from jerusalem where 
we found not what we sought that is the beginning of the 
septem sermones 
then it began to flow out of me and in the course of 
three evenings the thing was written as soon as i took 
up the pen the whole ghastly assemblage evaporated the 
room quieted and the atmosphere cleared the haunting 
was over  
the dead had appeared in a fantasy on january i ii and had 
said that they were about to go to jerusalem to pray at the holiest 
gravesi their trip had evidently not been successful the septem 
sermones ad mortuos is a culmination of the fantasies of this period 
it is a psychological cosmology cast in the form of a gnostic 
creation myth in jungs fantasies a new god had been born in 
his soul the god who is the son of the frogs abraxas jung 
understood this symbolically he saw this figure as representing

 i liber novus 
the uniting of the christian god with satan and hence as depicting 
a transformation of the western godimage not until  in 
answer to ob did jung elaborate on this theme in public 
jung had studied the literature on gnosticism in the course 
of his preparatory reading for transformations and symbols of the 
libido in january and october  while on military service 
he studied the works of the gnostics after writing the septem 
sermones in the black books jung recopied it in a calligraphic 
script into a separate book slightly rearranging the sequence 
he added the following inscription under the title the seven 
instructions of the dead written by basilides in alexandria 
the city where the east touches the westi he then had this 
privately printed adding to the inscription translated from 
the greek original into german this legend indicates the 
stylistic effects on jung of latenineteenthcentury classical 
scholarship he recalled that he wrote it on the occasion of 
the founding of the psychological club and regarded it as a 
gift to edith rockefeller mccormick for founding the club  
he gave copies to friends and confidants presenting a copy to 
alphonse maeder he wrote 
i could not presume to put my name to it but chose instead 
the name of one of those great minds of the early christian era 
which christianity obliterated it fell quite unexpectedly into 
my lap like a ripe fruit at a time of great stress and has kindled 
a light of hope and comfort for me in my bad hourso 
on january   jung drew a mandala in the black books 
see appendix a this was the first sketch of the systema 
munditotius he then proceeded to paint this on the back of 
it he wrote in english this is the first mandala i constructed 
in the year  wholly unconscious of what it meant the 
fantasies in the black books continued the systema munditotius is 
a pictorial cosmology of the sermones 
between june ii and october   jung was on military 
service in chateau doex as commander of the english prisoners 
of war around august he wrote to smith ely jeliffe that his 
military service had taken him completely away from his work 
and that on his return he hoped to finish a long paper about the 
types he concluded the letter by writing with us everything 
is unchanged and quiet everything else is swallowed by the war 
the psychosis is still increasing going on and on 
at this time he felt that he was still in a state of chaos and 
that it only began to clear toward the end of the warl from the 
beginning of august to the end of september he drew a series 
of twentyseven mandalas in pencil in his army notebook which 
he preserved at first he did not understand these mandalas 
but felt that they were very significant from august  he drew 
a mandala on most days this gave him the feeling that he had 
taken a photograph of each day and he observed how these mandalas changed he recalled that he received a letter from this dutch 
woman that got on my nerves terribly in this letter this woman 
that is moltzer argued that the fantasies stemming from the 
unconscious possessed artistic worth and should be considered as 
art jung found this troubling because it was not stupid and 
moreover modern painters were attempting to make art out of 
the unconscious this awoke a doubt in him whether his fantasies 
were really spontaneous and natural on the next day he drew a 
mandala and a piece of it was broken off leaving the symmetry 
only now did i gradually come to what the mandala really 
is formation transformation the eternal minds eternal 
recreation and that is the self the wholeness of the per
sonality which when everything is well is harmonious but 
which can bear no self deception my mandala images were 
cryptograms on the state of my self which were delivered 
to me each day 
the mandala in question appears to be the mandala of august  
 the second line is from goethes faust mephistopheles is 
addressing faust giving him directions to the realm of the mothers 
mephistopheles 
a glowing tripod will finally show you 
that you are in the deepest most deepest ground 
by its light you will see the mothers 
the one sits others stand and walk 
as it may chance formation transformation 
the eternal minds eternal recreation 
covered in images of all creatures 
they do not see you since they only see shades 
then hold your heart since the danger is great 
and go straight to that tripod 
touch it with the keyp 
the leter in question has not come to light however in a 
subsequent unpublished letter from november  while at 
chateau doex jung wrote that m moltzer has again disturbed 
me with letters he reproduced the mandalas in liber n ovus he 
noted that it was during this period that a living idea of the self 
first came to him the self i thought was like the monad which 
i am and which is my world the mandala represents this monad 
and corresponds to the microcosmic nature of the soul at this 
point he did not know where this process was leading but he 
began to grasp that the mandala represented the goal of the pro
cess only when i began to paint the mandalas did i see that all 
the paths i took all the steps i made allied back to the one point 
that is to the center the mandala became the expression of all 
paths in the s jungs understanding of the significance 
of the mandala deepened

the draft had contained fantasies from october  to 
february  in the winter of  jung wrote a fresh manuscript 
called scrutinies which began where he had left off in this he 
transcribed fantasies from april  until june  as in the 
first two books of liber n ovus jung interspersed the fantasies with 
interpretive commentariesi he included the sermones in this 
material and now added philemons commentaries on each 
sermon in these philemon stressed the compensatory nature 
of his teaching he deliberately stressed precisely those conceptions 
that the dead lacked scrutinies effectively forms liber tertius of 
liber n ovus the complete sequence of the text would thus be 
liber primus the way of what is to come 
liber secundus the images of the erring 
liber tertius scrutinies 
during this period jung continued transcribing the draft 
into the calligraphic volume and adding paintings the fantasies 
in the black books became more intermittent he portrayed his 
realization of the significance of the sel which took place in the 
autumn of  in scrutiniesi this contains jungs vision of the 
reborn god culminating in the portrayal of abraxas he realized 
that much of what was given to him in the earlier part of the book 
that is liber primus and liber secundus was actually given to him 
by philemoni he realized that there was a prophetic wise old man 
in him to whom he was not identical this represented a critical 
dis identification on january   jung wrote to j b lang 
the work on the unconscious has to happen first and foremost 
for us ourselves our patients profit from it indirectly the 
danger consists in the prophets delusion which often is the 
result of dealing with the unconscious it is the devil who 
says disdain all reason and science mankinds highest powers 
that is never appropriate even though we are forced to 
acknowledge the existence ofj the irrationali 
jungs critical task in working over his fantasies was to 
differentiate the voices and characters for example in the black 
books it is jungs i who speaks the sermones to the dead in 
scrutinies it is not jungs i but philemon who speaks them in 
the black books the main figure with whom jung has dialogues is 
his soul in some sections of liber n ovus this is changed to the 
serpent and the bird in one conversation in january  his 
soul explained to him that when the above and below are not 
united she falls into three partsa serpent the human soul 
and the bird or heavenly soul which visits the gods thus jungs 
revision here can be seen to reflect his understanding of the 
tripartite nature of his soull 
during this period jung continued to work over his material 
and there is some indication that he discussed it with his colleagues 
in march  he wrote to j b lang who had sent him some of 
his own fantasies 
i would not want to say anything more than telling you 
to continue with this approach because as you have observed 
correctly yoursel it is very important that we experience 
the contents of the unconscious before we form any 
opinions about it i very much agree with you that we introduction i  
have to grapple with the knowledge content of gnosis and 
neoplatonism since these are the systems that contain the 
materials which are suited to form the basis of a theory of 
the unconscious spirit i have already been working on this 
myself for a long time and also have had ample opportunity 
to compare my experiences at least partially with those of 
others thats why i was very pleased to hear pretty much 
the same views from you i am glad that you have discovered 
all on your own this area of work which is ready to be 
tackled up to now i lacked workers i am happy that you 
want to join forces with me i consider it very important 
that you extricate your own material uninfluenced from the 
unconscious as carefully as possible my material is very 
voluminous very complicated and in part very graphic up 
to almost completely worked through clarifications but 
what i completely lack is comparative modern material 
zarathustra is too strongly consciously formed meyrink 
retouches aesthetically furthermore i feel he is lacking in 
religious sincerityi 
the content 
liber n ovus thus presents a series of active imaginations together 
with jungs attempt to understand their significance this work of 
understanding encompasses a number of interlinked threads an 
attempt to understand himself and to integrate and develop the 
various components of his personality an attempt to understand 
the structure of the human personality in general an attempt to 
understand the relation of the individual to presentday society 
and to the community of the dead an attempt to understand the 
psychological and historical effects of christianity and an attempt 
to grasp the future religious development of the west jung 
discusses many other themes in the work including the nature of 
selfknowledge the nature of the soul the relations of thinking 
and feeling and the psychological types the relation of inner 
and outer masculinity and femininity the uniting of opposites 
solitude the value of scholarship and learning the status of science 
the significance of symbols and how they are to be understood 
the meaning of the war madness divine madness and psychiatry 
how the imitation of christ is to be understood today the death 
of god the historical significance of nietzsche and the relation 
of magic and reason 
the overall theme of the book is how jung regains his soul 
and overcomes the contemporary malaise of spiritual alienation 
this is ultimately achieved through enabling the rebirth of a new 
image of god in his soul and developing a new worldview in the 
form of a psychological and theological cosmology liber n ovus 
presents the prototype of jungs conception of the individuation 
process which he held to be the universal form of individual 
psychological development liber novus itself can be understood 
on one hand as depicting jungs individuation process and on 
the other hand as his elaboration of this concept as a general 
psychological schema at the beginning of the book jung refinds 
his soul and then embarks on a sequence of fantasy adventures 
which form a consecutive narrative he realized that until then 
he had served the spirit of the time characterized by use and 
value in addition to this there existed a spirit of the depths 
which led to the things of the soul in terms of jungs later 
 on page  of the manuscript of scrutinies a date is indicated  jiiji which suggests that they were written in the latter half of  and thus after the mandala 
experiences at chateau doex

 i liber novus 
biographical memoir the spirit of the times corresponds to 
personality no and the spirit of the depths corresponds to 
personality no thus this period could be seen as a return to 
the values of personality no the chapters follow a particular 
format they begin with the exposition of dramatic visual fantasies 
in them jung encounters a series of figures in various settings 
and enters into conversation with them he is confronted 
with unexpected happenings and shocking statements he then 
attempts to understand what had transpired and to formulate 
the significance of these events and statements into general psycho
logical conceptions and maxims jung held that the significance 
of these fantasies was due to the fact that they stemmed from the 
mythopoeic imagination which was missing in the present rational 
age the task of individuation lay in establishing a dialogue with 
the fantasy figuresor contents of the collective unconscious
and integrating them into consciousness hence recovering the 
value of the mythopoeic imagination which had been lost to the 
modern age and thereby reconciling the spirit of the time with 
the spirit of the depth this task was to form a leitmotif of his 
subsequent scholarly work 
a n ew spring of life 
in  jung wrote several essays and a short book in which 
he began to attempt to translate some of themes of liber n ovus 
into contemporary psychological language and to reflect on the 
significance and the generality of his activity significantly in these 
works he presented the first outlines of the main components of 
his mature psychology a full account of these papers is beyond 
the scope of this introduction the following overview highlights 
elements that link most directly with liber n ovus 
in his works between ii and  he had principally been 
concerned with establishing a structural account of general 
human functioning and of psychopathology in addition to his 
earlier theory of complexes we see that he had already formulated 
conceptions of a phylogenetically acquired unconscious peopled 
by mythic images of a nonsexual psychic energy of the gen
eral types of introversion and extraversion of the compensatory 
and prospective function of dreams and of the synthetic and 
constructive approach to fantasies while he continued to expand 
and develop these conceptions in detail a new project emerges 
here the attempt to provide a temporal account of higher devel
opment which he termed the individuation process this was a 
pivotal theoretical result of his selfexperimentation the full 
elaboration of the individuation process and its historical and 
crosscultural comparison would come to occupy him for the 
rest of his life 
in  he presented a lecture to the association for analytical 
psychology entitled the structure of the unconscious which 
was first published in a french translation in flournoys archives 
de psych  logie  here he differentiated two layers of the uncon
scious the first the personal unconscious onsisted in elements 
acquired during ones lifetime together with elements that could 
equally well be conscious the second was the impersonal 
unconscious or collective psyche while consciousness and 
the personal unconscious were developed and acquired in the 
course of ones lifetime the collective psyche was inheritedii in this essay jung discussed the curious phenomena that resulted from 
assimilating the unconscious he noted that when individuals 
annexed the contents of the collective psyche and regarded them as 
personal attributes they experienced extreme states of superiority and 
inferiority he borrowed the term godlikeness from goethe 
and alfred adler to characterize this state which arose from fusing 
the personal and collective psyche and was one of the dangers 
of analysis 
jung wrote that it was a difficult task to differentiate the 
personal and collective psyche one of the factors one came up 
against was the personaones mask or role this represented 
the segment of the collective psyche that one mistakenly regarded 
as individual when one analyzed this the personality dissolved 
into the collective psyche which resulted in the release of a 
stream of fantasies l the treasures of mythological thinking 
and feeling are unlocked the difference between this state 
and insanity lay in the fact that it was intentional 
two possibilities arose one could attempt to regressively 
restore persona and return to the prior state but it was impossible 
to get rid of the unconscious alternatively one could accept 
the condition of godlikeness however there was a third way 
the hermeneutic treatment of creative fantasies this resulted 
in a synthesis of the individual with the collective psyche which 
revealed the individual lifeline this was the process of indi
viduation in a subsequent undated revision of this paper jung 
introduced the notion of the anima as a counterpart to that of 
the persona he regarded both of these as subjectimagoes 
here he defined the anima as how the subject is seen by the 
collective unconscious 
the vivid description of the vicissitudes of the state of 
godlikeness mirror some of jungs affective states during his 
confrontation with the unconscious the notion of the differen
tiation of the persona and its analysis corresponds to the opening 
section of liber novus where jung sets himself apart from his 
role and achievements and attempts to reconnect with his soul 
the release of mythological fantasies is precisely what ensued in his 
case and the hermeneutic treatment of creative fantasies was what 
he presented in layer two of liber novus the differentiation of 
the personal and impersonal unconscious provided a theoretical 
understanding of jungs mythological fantasies it suggests that he 
did not view them as stemming from his personal unconscious 
but from the inherited collective psyche if so his fantasies 
stemmed from a layer of the psyche that was a collective human 
inheritance and were not simply idiosyncratic or arbitrary 
in october of the same year jung presented two talks to 
the psychological club the first was titled adaptation this 
took two forms adaptation to outer and inner conditions the 
inner was understood to designate the unconscious adaptation 
to the inner led to the demand for individuation which was 
contrary to adaptation to others answering this demand and 
the corresponding break with conformity led to a tragic guilt 
that required expiation and called for a new collective function 
because the individual had to produce values that could serve as a 
substitute for his absence from society these new values enabled 
one to make reparation to the collective individuation was for 
the few those who were insufficiently creative should rather 
reestablish collective conformity with a society the individual 
 after his separation with freud jung found that flournoy was of continued support to him see jung in flournoy from india to the planet mars p ix

had not only to create new values but also socially recognizable 
ones as society had a right to expect realizable values 
read in terms of jungs situation this suggests that his break 
with social conformity to pursue his individuation had led him 
to the view that he had to produce socially realizable values as an 
expiation this led to a dilemma would the form in which jung 
embodied these new values in liber n ovus be socially acceptable 
and recognizable this commitment to the demands of society 
separated jung from the anarchism of the dadaists 
the second talk was on individuation and collectivity he 
argued that individuation and collectivity were a pair of opposites 
related by guilt society demanded imitation through the process 
of imitation one could gain access to values that were ones own 
in analysis through imitation the patient learns individuation 
because it reactivates his own values it is possible to read this 
as a comment on the role of imitation in the analytic treatments 
of those of his patients whom jung had now encouraged to embark 
on similar processes of development the claim that this process 
evoked the patients preexisting values was a counter to the 
charge of suggestion 
in november while on military service at herisau jung wrote 
a paper on the transcendent function which was published 
only in there he depicted the method of eliciting and 
developing fantasies that he later termed active imagination and 
explained its therapeutic rationale this paper can be viewed as 
an interim progress report on jungs selfexperimentation and 
may profitably be considered as a preface to liber novus 
jung noted that the new attitude gained from analysis became 
obsolete unconscious materials were needed to supplement the 
conscious attitude and to correct its onesidedness but because 
energy tension was low in sleep dreams were inferior expressions 
of unconscious contents thus other sources had to be turned 
to namely spontaneous fantasies a recently recovered dream 
book contains a series of dreams from  to  a close 
comparison of this book with the black books indicates that his 
active imaginations did not derive directly from his dreams 
and that these two streams were generally independent 
jung described his technique for inducing such spontaneous 
fantasies the training consists first of all in systematic exercises 
for eliminating critical attention thus producing a vacuum in 
consciousness one commenced by concentrating on a particular 
mood and attempting to become as conscious as possible of all 
fantasies and associations that came up in connection with it the 
aim was to allow fantasy free play without departing from the 
initial affect in a free associative process this led to a concrete 
or symbolic expression of the mood which had the result of 
bringing the affect nearer to consciousness hence making it more 
understandable doing this could have a vitalizing effect individuals 
could draw paint or sculpt depending on their propensities 
visual types should concentrate on the expectation that an 
inner image will be produced as a rule such a fantasyimage

will actually appearperhaps hypnagogicallyand should 
be carefully noted down in writing audioverbal types usually 
hear inner words perhaps mere fragments or apparently 
meaningless sentences to begin with  others at such times 
simply hear their other voice  still rarer but equally 
valuable is automatic writing direct or with the planchette  
once these fantasies had been produced and embodied two 
approaches were possible creative formulation and understanding 
each needed the other and both were necessary to produce the 
transcendent function which arose out of the union of conscious 
and unconscious contents 
for some people jung noted it was silnple to note the other 
voice in writing and to answer it from the standpoint of the i it 
is exactly as if a dialogue were taking place between two human 
beings   this dialogue led to the creation of the transcendent 
function which resulted in a widening of consciousness this 
depiction of inner dialogues and the means of evoking fantasies 
in a waldng state represents jungs own undertaldng in the black 
books the interplay of creative formulation and understanding 
corresponds to jungs work in liber novus jung did not publish 
this paper he later remarked that he never finished his work on 
the transcendent function because he did it only halfheartedl y 
in  jung published a short book with a long title the 
psychology of the unconscious processes an overview of the modern 
theory and method of analytical psychology in his preface dated 
december  he proclaimed the psychological processes that 
accompanied the war had brought the problem of the chaotic 
unconscious to the forefront of attention however the psychology 
of the individual corresponded to the psychology of the nation 
and only the transformation of the attitude of the individual 
could bring about cultural renewal  this articulated the intimate 
interconnection between individual and collective events that was 
at the center of liber novus for jung the conjunction between 
his precognitive visions and the outbreak of war had made 
apparent the deep subliminal connections between individual 
fantasies and world eventsand hence between the psychology of 
the individual and that of the nation what was now required was 
to work out this connection in more detail 
jung noted that after one had analyzed and integrated 
the contents of the personal unconscious one came up against 
mythological fantasies that stemmed from the phylogenetic layer 
of the unconscious the psychology of the unconscious processes 
provided an exposition of the collective suprapersonal absolute 
unconsciousthese terms being used interchangeably jung 
argued that one needed to separate oneself from the unconscious 
by presenting it visibly as something separate from one it was 
vital to differentiate the i from the noni namely the collective 
psyche or absolute unconscious to do this man must necessarily 
stand upon firm jeet in his i function that is he must fulfil his duty 
toward life completely so that he may in every respect be a vitally living 
member ofsociety  jung had been endeavoring to accomplish these 
tasks during this period

io i liber novus 
the contents of this unconscious were what jung in 
transformations and symbols of the libido had called typical myths or 
primordial images he described these dominants as the ruling 
powers the gods that is images of dominating laws and principles 
average regularities in the sequence of images that the brain has 
received from the sequence of secular processes one needed to 
pay particular attention to these dominants particularly important 
was the detachment of the mythological or collective psychological contents 
from the objects of consciousness and their consolidation as psychological 
realities outside the individual psyche  this enabled one to cne 
to terms with activated residues of our ancestral history the 
differentiation of the personal from the nonpersonal resulted in 
a release of energy 
these comments also mirror his activity his attempt to 
differentiate the various characters which appeared and to 
consolidate them as psychological realities the notion that these 
figures had a psychological reality in their own right and were not 
merely subjective figments was the main lesson that he attributed 
to the fantasy figure of elijah psychic objectivity 
jung argued that the era of reason and skepticism inaugurated 
by the french revolution had repressed religion and irrationalism 
this in turn had serious consequences leading to the outbreak of 
irrationalism represented by the world war it was thus a historical 
necessity to acknowledge the irrational as a psychological factor 
the acceptance of the irrational forms one of the central themes 
of liber n ovus 
in the psychology of the unconscious processes jung developed his 
conception of the psychological types he noted that it was a 
common development that the psychological characteristics of 
the types were pushed to extreme by what he termed the law 
of enantiodromia or the reversal into the opposite the other 
hllction entered in namely feeling for the introvert and thinking 
for the extravert these secondary functions were found in the 
unconscious the development of the contrary function led to 
individuation as the contrary function was not acceptable to 
consciousness a special technique was required to come to terms 
with it namely the production of the transcendent function the 
unconscious was a danger when one was not at one with it but 
with the establishment of the transcendent function the dis
harmony ceased this rebalancing gave access to the productive and 
beneficent aspects of the unconscious the unconscious contained 
the wisdn and experience of untold ages and thus formed an 
unparalleled guide the development of the contrary function 
appears in the mysterium section of liber n ovus the attempt to 
gain the wisdom stored in the unconscious is portrayed throughout 
the book in which jung asks his soul to tell him what she sees and 
the ineaning of his fantasies the unconscious is here viewed as a 
source of higher wisdom he concluded the essay by indicating the 
personal and experiential nature of his new conceptions our age 
is seeking a new spring of life i found one and drank of it and the 
water tasted good 
the way to the self 
in ii jung wrote a paper entitled on the unconscious where 
he noted that all of us stood between two worlds the world of 
 ibid p  
 ibid p  
 analytical psychology p  
 see below pp  external perception and the world of perception of the unconscious 
this distinction depicts his experience at this time he wrote 
that friedrich schiller had claimed that the approximation of these 
two worlds was through art by contrast jung argued i am of 
the opinion that the union of rational and irrational truth is to 
be found not so much in art as in the symbol per se for it is the 
essence of the symbol to contain both the rational and irrationalg 
symbols he maintained stemmed from the unconscious and 
the creation of symbols was the most important function of the 
unconscious while the compensatory function of the unconscious 
was always present the symbolcreating function was present only 
when we were willing to recognize it here we see him continuing 
to eschew viewing his productions as art it was not art but symbols 
which were of paramount importance here the recognition and 
recuperation of this symbolcreating power is portrayed in liber 
n ovus it depicts jungs attempt to understand the psychological 
nature of symbolism and to view his fantasies symbolically he 
concluded that what was unconscious at any given epoch was 
only relative and changing what was required now was the 
remolding of our views in accordance with the active forces of 
the unconsciousi thus the task confronting him was one of 
translating the conceptions gained through his confrontation 
with the unconscious and expressed in a literary and symbolic 
manner in liber n ovus into a language that was compatible with 
the contemporary outlook 
the following year he presented a paper in england before 
the society of psychical research of which he was an honorary 
member on the psychological foundations of the belief in 
spiritsi he differentiated between two situations in which the 
collective unconscious became active in the first it became 
activated through a crisis in an individuals life and the collapse 
of hopes and expectations in the second it becalne activated at 
times of great social political and religious upheaval at such 
moments the factors suppressed by the prevailing attitudes 
accumulate in the collective unconscious strongly intuitive 
individuals become aware of these and try to translate them 
into communicable ideas if they succeeded in translating the 
unconscious into a cnmunicable language this had a redeenling 
effect the contents of the unconscious had a disturbing effect 
in the first situation the collective unconscious might replace 
reality which is pathological in the second situation the individual 
may feel disorientated but the state is not pathological this 
differentiation suggests that jung viewed his own experience as 
falling under the second headingnamely the activation of the 
collective unconscious due to the general cultural upheaval thus 
his initial fear of impending insanity in ii lay in his failure to 
realize this distinction 
in ii he presented a series of seminars to the psychological 
club on his work on typology and was engaged in extensive 
scholarly research n this subject at this time he developed 
and expanded the themes articulated in these papers in ii 
in psychological types as regards the working over of thenles 
of liber n ovus the most important section was chapter  the 
type problem in poetry the basic issue discussed here was how 
the problem of opposites could be resolved through the produc
tion of the uniting or reconciling symbol this forms one of the 
 collected papers on analytical psychology p  this sentence appeared only in the first edition of jungs book

central themes of liber n ovus jung presented detailed analysis 
of the issue of the resolution of the problem of opposites in 
hinduism taoism meister eckhart and in present times in 
the work of carl spitteler this chapter can also be read in terms 
of a meditation on some of the historical sources that directly 
informed his conceptions in liber novus it also heralded the 
introduction of an important method rather than directly discuss
ing the issue of the reconciliation of opposites in liber novus he 
sought out historical analogies and commented upon them 
in  the self emerged as a psychological concept jung 
defined it as follows 
inasmuch as the i is only the center of my field of 
consciousness it is not identical with the totality of my 
psyche being merely a complex among other complexes 
hence i discriminate between the i and the self since the i 
is only the subject of my consciousness while the self is the 
subject of my totality hence it also includes the uncon
scious psyche in this sense the self would be an ideal 
greatness which embraces and includes the i in unconscious 
fantasy the self often appears as the superordinated or ideal 
personality as faust is in relation to goethe and zarathustra 
to nietzschei 
he equated the hindu notion of brahmanatman with the self 
at the same time jung provided a definition of the soul he argued 
that the soul possessed qualities that were complementary to the 
persona containing those qualities that the conscious attitude 
lacked this complementary character of the soul also affected its 
sexual character so that a man had a feminine soul or anima and 
a woman had a masculine soul or animus this corresponded to 
the fact that men and women had both masculine and feminine 
traits he also noted that the soul gave rise to images that were 
assumed to be worthless fronl the rational perspective there were 
four ways of using them 
the first possibility of malcing use of them is artistic if 
one is in anyway gifted in that direction a second is philosophical 
speculation a third is quasireligious leading to heresy and 
the founding of sects and a fourth way of employing the 
dynamis of these images is to squander it in every form 
of licentiousness  
from this perspective the psychological utilization of these 
images would represent a fifth way for it to succeed psychology 
had to distinguish itself clearly from art philosophy and religion 
this necessity accounts for jungs rejection of the alternatives 
in the subsequent black books he continued to elaborate his 
mythology the figures developed and transformed into one 
another the differentiation of the figures was accompanied 
by their coalescence as he came to regard them as aspects of 
underlying components of the personality on january  
he had a conversation with his soul concerning both his vocation 
and liber novus

his soul here pointedly urged him to publish his material at 
which he balked three days later his soul informed him that 
the new religion expresses itself only in the transformation of 
human relations relations do not let themselves be replaced 
by the deepest knowledge moreover a religion does not consist 
only in knowledge but at its visible kvel in a new ordering of 
human affairs therefore expect no further knowledge from me 
you know everything that is to be known about the manifested

i i liber novus 
what he had learned through his selfinvestigation into life 
during this period the themes of the psychology of religion 
and the relation of religion to psychology became increasingly 
prominent in his work starting from his seminar in polzeath 
in cornwall in  he attempted to develop a psychology of 
the religiousmaking process rather than proclaiming a new 
prophetic revelation his interest lay in the psychology of religious 
experiences the task was to depict the translation and transposi
tion of the numinous experience of individuals into symbols and 
eventually into the dogmas and creeds of organized religions 
and finally to study the psychological function of such symbols 
for such a psychology of the religionmaking process to succeed 
it was essential that analytical psychology while providing an 
affirmation of the religious attitude did not succumb to becoming 
a creedi 
in  jung wrote a paper on the relation of analytical 
psychology to poetic art works he differentiated two types of 
work the first which sprang entirely from the authors intention 
and the second which seized the author examples of such 
symbolic works were the second part of goethes faust and 
nietzsches zarathustra he held that these works stemmed 
from the collective unconscious in such instances the creative 
process consisted in the unconscious activation of an archetypal 
image the archetypes released in us a voice that was stronger 
than our own 
whoever speaks in primordial images speaks with a thousand 
voices he enthrals and overpowers  he transmutes our 
personal destiny into the destiny of mankind and evokes 
in us all those beneficent forces that ever and anon have 
enabled humanity to find a refuge from every peril and to 
outlive the longest night  
the artist who produced such works educated the spirit of 
the age and compensated the onesidedness of the present in 
describing the genesis of such symbolic works jung seemingly had 
his own activities in mind thus while jung refused to regard 
liber novus as art his reflections on its composition were 
nevertheless a critical source of his subsequent conceptions and 
theories of art the implicit question that this paper raised was 
whether psychology could now serve this function of educating 
the spirit of the age and compensating the onesidedness of the 
present from this period onward he came to conceive of the task 
of his psychology in precisely such a manner  
publication deliberations 
from  onward in addition to discussions with emma 
jung and toni wolff jung had extensive discussions with cary 
baynes and wolfgang stockmayer concerning what to do with 
liber n ovus and around its potential publication because these 
discussions took place when he was still working on it they are critically important cary fink was born in  she studied 
at vassar college where she was taught by kristine mann 
who became one of jungs earliest followers in the united 
states in  she married jaime de angulo and completed her 
medical training at johns hopkins in ii in  she left him 
and went to zurich with kristine mann she entered analysis with 
jung she never practiced analysis and jung highly respected her 
critical intelligence in  she married peter baynes they 
were subsequently divorced in  jung asked her to make 
a fresh transcription of liber n ovus because he had added a lot 
of material since the previous transcription she undertook this 
in  and  when jung was in africa her typewritecwas 
heavy so she first copied it by hand and then typed it out 
these notes recount her discussions with jung and are written 
in the form of letters to him but were not sent

in another book of meyrinks the white dominican 
you said he made use of exactly the same symbolism that 
had come to you in the first vision that revealed to your 
unconscious furthermore you said he had spoken of a 
red book which contained certain mysteries and the 
book that you are writing about the unconscious you have 
called the red book  then you said you were in doubt 
as to what to do about that book meyrink you said could 
throw his into novel form and it was all right but you could 
only command the scientific and philosophical method 
and that stuff you couldnt cast into that mold i said you 
could use the zarathustra form and you said that was true 
but you were sick of that i am too then you said you had 
thought of making an autobiography out of it that would 
seem to me by far the best because then you would tend 
to write as you spoke which was in a very colorful way but 
apart from any difficulty with the form you said you dreaded 
making it public because it was like selling your house 
but i jumped upon you with both feet there and said it 
wasnt a bit like that because you and the book stood for 
a constellation of the universe and that to talce the book 
as being purely personal was to identify yourself with it 
which was something you would not think of permitting to 
your patients  then we laughed over my having caught 
you redhanded as it were goethe had been caught in the 
same difficulty in the nd part of faust in which he had 
gotten into the unconscious and found it so difficult to 
get the right form that he had finally died leaving the 
mss as such in his drawer so much of what you had 
experienced you said would be counted as sheer lunacy 
that if it were published you would lose out altogether not 
only as a scientist but as a human being but not i said if 
you went at it from the dichtung und wahrheit poetry

senting any of it as dichtung when it was all wahrheit but 
it does not seem to me falseness to make use of that much 
of a mask in order to protect yourself from philistiaand 
after all as i said philistia has its rights confronted with the 
choice of you as a lunatic and themselves as inexperienced 
fools they have to choose the former alternative but if 
they can place you as a poet their faces are saved much 
of your material you said has come to you as runes  the 
explanation of those runes sounds like the veriest nonsense 
but that does not matter if the end product is sense in 
your case i said apparently you have become conscious of 
more of the steps of creation than ever anyone before in 
most cases the mind evidently drops out of the irrelevant 
stuff automatically and delivers the end product whereas 
you bring along the whole business matrix process and 
product naturally it is frightfully more difficult to handle 
then my hour was up 
january  
what you told me some time ago set me thinking and 
suddenly the other day while i was reading the vorspiel 
auf dem theater prelude in the theater it came to 
me that you too ought to malce use of that principle which 
goethe has handled so beautifully all through faust namely 
the placing in opposition of the creative and eternal with 
the negative and transient you may not see right away what 
this has to do with the red book but i will explain as i 
understand it in this book you are going to challenge men 
to a new way of looking at their souls at any rate there is 
going to be in it a good deal that will be out of the grasp of 
the ordinary man just as at one period of your own life you 
would scarcely have understood it in a way it is a jewel 
you are giving to the world is it not my idea is that it needs 
a sort of protection in order not to be thrown into the gutter 
and finally made away with by a strangely clad jew 
the best protection you could devise it seems to me 
would be to put in incorporate the book itself an exposition 
of the forces that will attempt to destroy it it is one of 
your great gifts strength of seeing the black as well as the 
white of every given situation so you will know better 
than most of the people who attack the book what it is 
that they want to destroy could you not take the wind out 
of their sails by writing their criticism for them perhaps 
that is the very thing you have done in the introduction 
perhaps you would rather assume towards the public the 
attitude of talce or leave it and be blessed or be damned 
whichever you prefer that would be all right whatever 
there is of truth in it is going to survive in any case but i 
would like to see you do the other thing if it did not call 
for too much effort 
january  
you had the night before had a dream in which i appeared 
in a disguise and was to do work on the red book and 
you had been thinking about it all that day and during dr 
whartons hour preceding mine especially pleasant for her 
i must say  as you had said you had made up your mind to introduction i  
turn over to me all of your unconscious material represented 
by the red book etc to see what i as a stranger and impartial 
observer would say about it you thought i had a good critique 
and an impartial one toni you said was deeply interwoven 
with it and besides did not take any interest in the thing 
in itself nor in getting it into usable form she is lost in 
bird fluttering you said for yourself you said you had 
always known what to do with your ideas but here you were 
baffled when you approached them you became enmeshed 
as it were and could no longer be sure of anything you 
were certain sme of them had great importance but you 
could not find the appropriate formas they were now you 
said they might come out of a madhouse so then you said 
i was to copy down the contents of the red bookonce 
before you had had it copied but you had since then added 
a great deal of material so you wanted it done again and 
you would explain things to me as i went along for you 
understood nearly everything in it you said in this way we 
could come to discuss many things which never came up 
in my analysis and i could understand your ideas from the 
foundation you told me thensomething more of your own 
attitude toward the red book you said some of it hurt 
your sense of the fitness of things terribly and that you 
had shrunk from putting it down as it came to you but that 
you had started on the principle of voluntariness that is of 
making no corrections and so you had stuck to that some of 
the pictures were absolutely infantile but were intended 
so to be there were various figures speaking elias father 
philemon etc but all appeared to be phases of what you 
thought ought to be called the master you were sure that 
this latter was the same who inspired buddha mani christ 
mahometall those who may be said to have communed with 
god but the others had identified with him you abso
lutely refused to it could not be for you you said you had 
to remain the psychologistthe person who understood the 
process i said then that the thing to be done was to enable the 
world to understand the process also without their getting the 
notion that they had the master caged as it were at their 
beck  call they had to think of him as a pillar of fire per
petually moving on and forever out of human grasp yes 
you said itwas something like that perhaps it cannot yet be 
done as you talked i grew more and more aware of the 
immeasurability of the ideas which are filling you you said 
they had the shadow of eternity upon them and i could 
feel the truth of it 
on january  she noted that jung said of a dream which she 
had told him 
that it was a preparation for the red book because the red 
book told of the battle between the world of reality and the 
world of the spirit you said in that battle you had been very 
nearly torn asunder but that you had managed to keep your 
feet on the earth  malce an effect on reality that you said 
for you was the test of any idea and that you had no respect 
for any ideas however winged that had to exist off in space 
and were unable to malce an impression on realityl

 i liber novus 
there is an undated fragment of a letter draft to an unidentified 
person in which cary baynes expresses her view of the significance 
of liber n ovus and the necessity of its publication 
i am absolutely thunderstruck for example as i read the 
red book and see all that is told there for the right way 
for us of today to find how toni has kept it out of her systetti 
she wouldnt have an unconscious spot in her psyche had 
she digested even as much of the red book as i have read  
that i should think was not a third or a fourth and another 
difficult thing to understand is why she has no interest in 
seeing him publish it there are people in my country who 
would read it from cover to cover without stopping to 
breathe scarcely so does it reenvisage and clarify the things 
that are today staggering everyone who is trying to find the 
clue to life  he has put into it all the vigor and color of his 
speech all the directness and simplicity that come when as 
at cornwall the fire burns in him 
of course it may be that as he says if he published it as 
it is he would forever be hors du combat in the world of 
rational science but then there must be some way around 
that some way of protecting himself against stupidity in 
order that the people who would want the book need not 
go without for the time it will take the majority to get 
ready for it i always knew he must be able to write the 
fire that he can spealand here it is his published books 
are doctored up for the world at large or rather they are 
written out of his head  this out of his hearti 
these discussions vividly portray the depth of jungs 
deliberations concerning the publication of liber n ovus his 
sense of its centrality in comprehending the genesis of his 
work and his fear that the work would be misunderstood 
the impression that the style of the work would male on an 
unsuspecting public strongly concerned jung he  later recalled 
to aniela jaffe that the work still needed a suitable form in 
which it could be brought into the world because it sounded like 
prophecy which was not to his taste 
there appears to have been some discussion concerning these 
issues in jungs circle on may   cary baynes noted a 
discussion with peter baynes in which he argued that liber novus 
could be understood only by someone who had lmown jung by 
contrast she thought that the book 
was the record of the passage of the universe through the soul 
of a man and just as a person stands by the sea and listens to 
that very strange and awful music and cannot explain why his 
heart aches or why a cry of exaltation wants to leap from his 
throat so i thought it would be with the red book and that 
a man would be perforce lifted out of himself by the majesty 
of it and swung to heights he had never been beforei 
there are further signs that jung circulated copies of liber novus 
to confidantes and that the material was discussed together 
 the reference is to the polzeath seminar with the possibilities of its publication one such colleague 
was wolfgang stockmayer jung met stockmayer in in his 
unpublished obituary jung nominated him as the first german 
to be interested in his work he recalled that stockmayer was 
a true friend they traveled together in italy and switzerland 
and there was seldom a year in which they did not meet 
jung commented 
he distinguished himself through his great interest and 
equally great understanding for pathological psychic 
processes i also found with him a sympathetic reception 
for my broader viewpoint which became of importance 
for my later comparative psychological works  
stockmayer accompanied jung in the valuable penetration 
of our psychology into classical chinese philosophy the mystical 
speculations of india and tantric yoga 
on december  stockmayer wrote to jung 
i often long for the red book and i would like to have a 
transcript o what is available i failed to do so when i had 
it as things go i recently fantasized about a kind of journal 
of documents in a loose form for materials from the 
forge of the unconscious with words and colors 
it appears that jung sent some material to him on april  
 stockmayer wrote to jung 
in the meantime we have gone through scrutinies and 
it is the same impression as with the great wanderingi 
a selected collective milieu for such from the red book 
is certainly worth trying out although your commentary 
would be quite desired since a certain adjacent center of 
yours lies here ample access to sources is of great significance 
consciously and unconsciously and i obviously fantasize 
about facsimiles which you will understand you need 
not fear extraversion magic from me painting also has 
great appeal  
jungs ttianuscript commentaries see appendix b was possibly 
connected with these discussions 
thus figures in jungs circle held differing views concerning 
the significance of liber n ovus and whether it should be published 
which may have had bearings on jungs eventual decisions cary 
baynes did not complete the transcription getting as far as the 
first twentyseven pages of scrutinies for the next few years 
her time was taken up with the translation of jungs essays into 
english followed by the translation of the i ching 
at some stage which i estimate to be in the midtwenties 
jung went back to the draft and edited it again deleting and 
adding material on approximately  pages his revisions 
served to modernize the language and terminology  he also 
 i suspect that this may have been written to her exhusband jaime de angulo on july   he wrote to her  daresay you have been as busy as i have with that 
material of jungs  i read your letter the one in which you announced it and you warned me not to tell anyone and you added that you ought not to tell me but you 
knew i would feel so proud of you cfb

revised sotne of the material that he had already transcribed 
into the calligraphic volume of liber novus as well as some 
material that was left out it is hard to see why he undertook 
this unless he was seriously considering publishing it 
in  jung presented his seminars on analytical psychology 
to the psychological club here he discussed some of the 
important fantasies in liber n ovus he described how they 
unfolded and indicated how they formed the basis of the ideas 
in psychological types and the key to understanding its genesis 
the seminar was transcribed and edited by cary baynes that 
same year peter baynes prepared an english translation of the 
septem sermones ad mortuos which was privately published  jung 
gave copies to some of his englishspeaking students in a 
letter that is presumably a reply to one from henry murray 
thanking him for a copy jung wrote 
i am deeply convinced that those ideas that came to me 
are really quite wonderful things i can easily say that 
without blushing because i know how resistant and 
how foolishly obstinate i was when they first visited me 
and what a trouble it was until i could read this symbolic 
language so much superior to my dull conscious mind 
it is possible that jung may have considered the publication 
of the sermones as a trial for the publication of liber n ovus 
barbara hannah claims that he regretted publishing it and that 
he felt strongly that it should only have been written in the 
red book 
at some point jung wrote a manuscript entitled 
commentaries which provided a commentary on chapters  
 and ii of liber primus see appendix b he had discussed 
some of these fantasies in his  seminar and he goes into 
more detail here from the style and conceptions i would  
estimate that this text was written in the midtwenties he may 
have writtenor intended to writefurther commentaries 
for other chapters but these have not come to light this manu
script indicates the amount of work he put into understanding 
each and every detail of his fantasies 
jung gave a number of people copies of liber novus cary 
baynes peter baynes aniela jaffe wolfgang stockmayer and 
toni wolff copies may also have been given to others in  
a fire destroyed peter bayness house and damaged his copy of 
liber n ovus a few years later he wrote to jung asking if by chance 
he had another copy and offered to translate it jung replied i 
will try whether i can procure another copy of the red book 
please dont worry about translations i am sure there are  or  
translations already but i dont know of what and by whomoo 
this supposition was presumably based on the number of copies 
of the work in circulation 
jung let the following individuals read andor look at liber 
novus richard hull tina keller james kirsch ximena roelli 
de angulo as a child and kurt wolff aniela jaffe read the 
black books and tina keller was also allowed to read sections of 
the black books jung most likely showed the book to other close 
associates such as emil medtner franz rilclin sr erika schlegel 
hans triib and marielouise von franz it appears that he allowed 
 london stuart and watkins  introduction i  
those people to read liber n ovus whom he fully trusted and whom 
he felt had a full grasp of his ideas ite a number of his students 
did not fit into this category 
the t ransfortnation 
of psychotherapy 
liber novus is of critical significance for grasping the emergence of 
jungs new model of psychotherapy in  in transformation and 
symbols of the libido he considered the presence of mythological 
fantasiessuch as are present in liber novusto be the signs of 
a loosening of the phylogenetic layers of the unconscious and 
indicative of schizophrenia through his selfexperimentation 
he radically revised this position what he now considered critical 
was not the presence of any particular content but the attitude 
of the individual toward it and in particular whether an indi
vidual could accommodate such material in their worldview this 
explains why he commented in his afterword to liber n ovus that to 
the superficial observer the work would seem like madness and 
could have become so ifhe had failed to contain and comprehend 
the experiences in liber secundus chapter  he presents a 
critique of contemporary psychiatry highlighting its incapacity 
to differentiate religious experience or divine madness from 
psychopathology if the content of visions or fantasies had no 
diagnostic value he held that it was nevertheless critical to view 
them carefully 
out of his experiences he developed new conceptions of the 
aims and methods of psychotherapy since its inception at the 
end of the nineteenth century modern psychotherapy had been 
primarily concerned with the treatment of functional nervous 
disorders or neuroses as they came to be known from the time 
of the first world war onward jung reformulated the prac
tice of psychotherapy no longer solely preoccupied with the 
treatment of psychopathology it became a practice to enable 
the higher development of the individual through fostering the 
individuation process this was to have farreaching consequences 
not only for the developtnent of analytical psychology but also 
for psychotherapy as a whole 
to demonstrate the validity of the conceptions that he derived in 
liber novus jung attetnpted to show that the processes depicted 
within it were not unique and that the conceptions which he 
developed in it were applicable to others to study the productions 
of his patients he built up an extensive collection of their paintings 
so that his patients were not separated from their images he 
would generally ask them to malce copies for him 
during this period he continued to instruct his patients as 
to how to induce visions in a walting state in  christiana 
morgan came to jung for analysis she had been drawn to his ideas 
on reading psychological types and turned to him for assistance 
with her problems with relationships and her depressions in a 
session in  morgan noted jungs advice to her on how to 
produce visions 
well you see these are too vague for me to be able to say 
much about them they are only the beginning you only

 i liber novus 
use the retina of the eye at first in order to objectify then 
instead of keeping on trying to force the image out you just 
want to look in now when you see these images you want 
to hold them and see where they take youhow they change 
and you want to try to get into the picture yourselfto 
become one of the actors when i first began to do this i 
saw landscapes then i learned how to put myself into the 
landscape and the figures would talk to me and i would 
answer them  people said he has an artistic temperament 
but it was only that my unconscious was swaying me now 
i learn to act its drama as well as the drama of the outer life 
 so nothing can hurt me now i have written  pages 
of material from the unconscious told the vision of a giant 
who turned into an egg 
he described his own experiments in detail to his patients and 
instructed them to follow suit his role was one of supervising 
them in experimenting with their own stream of images morgan 
noted jung saying 
now i feel as though i ought to say something to you 
about these phantasies  the phantasies now seem to 
be rather thin and full of repetitions of the same motives 
there isnt enough fire and heat in them they ought to 
be more burning  you must be in them more that is you 
must be your own conscious critical self in themimposing 
your own judgments and criticisms  i can explain what i 
mean by telling you of my own experience i was writing 
in my book and suddenly saw a man standing watch over 
my shoulder one of the gold dots from my book flew 
up and hit him in the eye he asked me if i would talce 
it out i said nonot unless he told me who he was he 
said he wouldnt you see i knew that if i had done what 
he asked then he would have sunk into the unconscious 
and i would have missed the point of it ie why he had 
appeared from the unconscious at all finally he told me 
that he would tell me the meaning of certain hieroglyphs 
which i had had a few days previous this he did and i 
took the thing out of his eye and he vanished 
jung went so far as to suggest that his patients prepare their own 
red books morgan recalled him saying 
i should advise you to put it all down as beautifully as you 
canin some beautifully bound book it will seem as if you 
were malcing the visions banalbut then you need to do 
thatthen you are freed from the power of them if you 
do that with these eyes for instance they will cease to draw 
you you should never try to make the visions come again 
thinlc of it in your imagination and try to paint it then 
when these things are in some precious book you can go 
to the book  turn over the pages  for you it will be your 
churchyour cathedralthe silent places of your spirit 
where you will find renewal if anyone tells you that it is 
morbid or neurotic and you listen to themthen you will 
lose your soulfor in that book is your soul  in a letter to j a gilbert in  he commented on his procedure 
i found sometimes that it is of great help in handling such 
a case to encourage them to express their peculiar contents 
either in the form of writing or of drawing and painting 
there are so many incomprehensible intuitions in such cases 
phantasy fragments that rise from the unconscious for which 
there is almost no suitable language i let my patients find 
their own symbolic expressions their mythology 
philemons sanctuary 
in the s jungs interest increasingly shifted from the 
transcription of liber n ovus and the elaboration of his mythology 
in the black books to working on his tower in bollingen in  
he purchased some land on the upper shores of lake zurich in 
bollingen prior to this he and his family sometimes spent holidays 
camping around lalce zurich he felt the need to represent his 
innermost thoughts in stone and to build a completely primitive 
dwelling words and paper however did not seem real enough 
to me something more was needed he had to make a confession 
in stone the tower was a representation of individuation over 
the years he painted murals and made carvings on the walls the 
tower may be regarded as a threedimensional continuation of 
liber novus its liber ojartus at the end of liber secundus jung 
wrote i must catch up with a piece of the middle ageswithin 
myself we have only finished the middle ages ofothers i 
must begin early in that period when the hermits died out 
significantly the tower was deliberately built as a structure from 
the middle ages with no modern amenities the tower was an 
ongoing evolving work he carved this inscription on its wall 
philemonis sacrum fausti poenitentia philemons shrine
fausts repentance one of the murals in the tower is a portrait 
of philemon on april   jung wrote to richard wilhelm 
why are there no worldly cloisters for men who should live 
outside the timesio 
on january   jungs mother died on december  
december  he had the following dream 
i am on military service marching with a battalion in a wood 
by ossingen i come across excavations at a crossroads

then mummified corpses finally there comes a barouche in 
the style of the seventeenth century in it sits someone who 
is dead but still alive she turns her head when i address her 
as miss i am aware that miss is a title of nobilityl 
a few years later he grasped the significance of this dream 
he noted on december  
only now do i see for that the dream of  december 
 means the death of the anima she does not know

mother  since the death of my mother the a anima 
has fallen silent meaningfu 
a few years later he had a few further dialogues with his soul 
but his confrontation with the anima had effectively reached 
a closure at this point on january  i he had a dream set 
in liverpool 
several young swiss and i are down by the docks in 
liverpool it is a dark rainy night with smoke and clouds 
we walk up to the upper part of town which lies on a plateau 
we come to a small circular lake in a centrally located garden 
in the middle of this there is an island the men speak of a 
swiss who lives here in such a sooty dark dirty city but i 
see that on the island stands a magnolia tree covered with 
red flowers illuminated by an eternal sun and think now 
i know why this swiss fellow lives here he apparently also 
knows why i see a city map platej 
jung then painted a mandala based upon this map he attached 
great significance to this dream commenting later 
this dream represented my situation at the time i can 
still see the grayishyellowish raincoats glistening with the 
wetness of the rain everything was extremely unpleasant 
black and opaque just as i felt then but i had had a vision 
of unearthly beauty and that was why i was able to live 
at all    i saw that here the goal had been reached one 
could not go beyond the center the center is the goal 
and everything is directed toward that center through this 
dream i understood that the self is the principle and arche
type of orientation and meaning  
jung added that he himself was the one swiss the i was 
not the sel but from there one could see the divine miracle the 
small light resembled the great light henceforth he stopped 
painting mandalas the dream had expressed the unconscious 
developmental process which was not linear and he found it 
completely satisfying he felt utterly alone at that time preoccu
pied with something great that others didnt understand in the 
dream only he saw the tree while they stood in the darkness 
the tree appeared radiantly had he not had such a vision his life 
would have lost meaning 
the realization was that the self is the goal of individuation 
and that the process of individuation was not linear but consisted 
in a circumambulation of the self this realization gave him 
strength for otherwise the experience would have driven him 
or those around him crazy he felt that the mandala drawings 
showed him the self in its saving function and that this was 
his salvation the task now was one of consolidating these insights 
into his life and science 
in his i revision of the psychology of the unconscious processes 
he highlighted the significance of the midlife transition he 
argued that the first half of life could be characterized as the 
natural phase in which the prime aim was establishing oneself 
in the world gaining an income and raising a family the second

half of life could be characterized as the cultural phase which 
involved a revaluation of earlier values the goal in this period 
was one of conserving previous values together with the recog
nition of their opposites this meant that individuals had 
to develop the undeveloped and neglected aspects of their 
personality the individuation process was now conceived 
as the general pattern of human development he argued that 
there was a lack of guidance for this transition in contemporary 
society and he saw his psychology as filling this lacuna outside 
of analytical psychology jungs formulations have had an 
impact on the field of adult developmental psychology clearly 
his crisis experience formed the template for this conception of 
the requirements of the two halves of life liber n ovus depicts 
jungs reappraisal of his previous values and his attempt to 
develop the neglected aspects of his personality thus it formed 
the basis of his understanding of how the midlife transition could 
be successfully navigated 
in i he published a small book the relations between the i and 
the unconscious which was an expansion of his ii paper the 
structure of the unconscious here he expanded upon the interior 
drama of the transformation process adding a section dealing in 
detail with the process of individuation he noted that after one 
had dealt with the fantasies from the personal sphere one met 
with fantasies from the impersonal sphere these were not simply 
arbitrary but converged upon a goal hence these later fantasies 
could be described as processes of initiation which provided their 
nearest analogy for this process to take place active participation 
was required when the conscious mind participates actively 
and experiences each stage of the process  then the next image 
always starts off on the higher level that has been won and 
purposiveness develops 
after the assimilation of the personal unconscious the 
differentiation of the persona and the overcoming of the state 
of godlikeness the next stage that followed was the integration 
of the anima for men and of the animus for women jung argued 
that just as it was essential for a man to distinguish between what 
he was and how he appeared to others it was equally essential to 
become conscious of his invisible relations to the unconscious 
and hence to differentiate himself from the anima he noted 
that when the anima was unconscious it was projected for a 
child the first bearer of the soulimage was the mother and 
thereafter the women who aroused a mans feelings one needed 
to objectify the anima and to pose questions to her by the 
method of inner dialogue or active imagination everyone he 
claimed had this ability to hold dialogues with himor herself 
active imagination would thus be one form of inner dialogue a 
type of dramatized thinking it was critical to disidentify from 
the thoughts that arose and to overcome the assumption that 
one had produced them oneselfo what was most essential was 
not interpreting or understanding the fantasies but experiencing 
them this represented a shift from his emphasis on creative 
formulation and understanding in his paper on the transcendent 
function he argued that one should treat the fantasies com
pletely literally while one was engaged in them but symbolically 
when one interpreted them this was a direct description of 
jungs procedure in the black books the task of such discussions

i i liber novus 
was to objectify the effects of the anima and to become conscious 
of the contents that underlay these thereby integrating these into 
consciousness when one had become familiar with the unconscious 
processes reflected in the anima the anima then became a function 
of the relationship between consciousness and the unconscious as 
opposed to an autonomous complex again this process of the 
integration of the anima was the subject of liber n ovus and the 
black books it also highlights the fact that the fantasies in liber 
n ovus should be read symbolically and not literally to talce 
statements from them out of context and to cite them literally 
would represent a serious misunderstanding jung noted that 
this process had three effects 
the first effect is that the range of consciousness is 
increased by the inclusion of a great number and variety of 
unconscious contents the second is a gradual diminution 
of the dominating influence of the unconscious the third 
is an alteration in the personality 
after one had achieved the integration of the anima one 
was confronted with another figure namely the mana personality 
jung argued that when the anima lost her mana or power the 
man who assimilated it must have acquired this and so became 
a mana personality a being of superior will and wisdom however 
this figure was a dominant of the collective unconscious the 
recognized archetype of the powerful man in the form of hero 
chief magician medicine man and saint the lord of men and 
spirits the friend of gods thus in integrating the anima and 
attaining her power one inevitably identified with the figure of 
the magician and one faced the task of differentiating oneself 
from this he added that for women the corresponding figure 
was that of the great mother if one gave up the claim to victory 
over the anima possession by the figure of the magician ceased 
and one realized that the mana truly belonged to the midpoint 
of the personality namely the self the assillilation of the contents 
of the mana personality led to the self jungs description of the 
encounter with the mana personality both the identification and 
subsequent disidentification with it corresponds to his encounter 
with philemon in liber novus of the self jung wrote it might 
as well be called god in us the beginnings of our whole psychic 
life seem to be inextricably rooted to this point and all our 
highest and deepest purposes seem to be striving toward it 
jungs description of the self conveys the significance of his 
realization following his liverpool dream 
the self could be characterized as a kind of compensation 
for the conflict between inner and outer  the self is also 
the goal of life because it is the most complete expression 
of that fateful combination we call individuality  with 
the experiencing of the self as something irrational as an 
indefinable being to which the i is neither opposed nor 
subjected but in a relation of dependence and around

ja which it revolves very much as the earth revolves about the 
sunthen the goal of individuation has been reached 
the confrontation 
with the world 
why did jung stop working on libel n ovus in his afterword 
written in i he wrote 
my acquaintance with alchemy in i took me away 
from it the beginning of the end came in i when 
richard wilhelm sent me the text of the golden flower 
an alchemical treatise there the contents of this book found 
their way into actuality and i could no longer continue 
working on it 
there is one more completed painting in libel n ovus in 
i jung painted a mandala of a golden castle page i 
after painting it it struck him that the mandala had something 
chinese about it shortly afterward richard wilhelm sent him 
the text of the secret of the golden flower asking him to write a 
commentary on it jung was struck by it and the timing 
the text gave me an undreamedof confirmation of my 
ideas about the mandala and the circumambulation of the 
center this was the first event which broke through my 
isolation i became aware of an affinity i could establish ties 
with someone and something 
the significance of this confirmation is indicated in the lines 
that he wrote beneath the painting of the yellow castle jung 
was struck by the correspondences between the imagery and 
conceptions of this text and his own paintings and fantasies on 
may  i he wrote to wilhelm fate appears to have given 
us the role of two bridge pillars which carry the bridge between 
east and west only later did he realize that the alchemical 
nature of the text was important he worked on his commentary 
during i on september io i he wrote to wilhelm i am 
thrilled by this text which stands so close to our unconscious 
jungs comlnentary on the secret of the golden flower was a 
turning point it was his first public discussion of the significance 
of the inandala for the first time jung anonymously presented 
three of his own paintings from liber n ovus as examples of 
european mandalas and commented on them to wilhelm he 
wrote on october  i concerning the mandalas in the volume 
the images amplify one another precisely through their diversity 
they give an excellent image of the effort of the unconscious 
european spirit to grasp eastern eschatology this connection 
between the european unconscious spirit and eastern escha
tology became one of the major themes in jungs work in the 
is which he explored through further collaborations with the 
 foreword to the second german edition commentary to the secret of the golden flower cw  p

indologists wilhelm hauer and heinrich zimmer at the same 
time the form of the work was crucial rather than revealing the full 
details of his own experiment or those of his patients jung used 
the parallels with the chinese text as an indirect way of speaking 
about it much as he had begun to do in chapter  of psychological 
types this allegorical method now became his preferred form 
rather than write directly of his experiences he commented on 
analogous developments in esoteric practices and most of all 
in medieval alchemy 
shortly afterward jung abruptly left off working on liber 
n ovus the last fullpage image was left unfinished and he 
stopped transcribing the text he later recalled that when he 
reached this central point or tao his confrontation with the 
world commenced and he began to give many lectures thus 
the confrontation with the unconscious drew to a close and 
the confrontation with the world began jung added that he 
saw these activities as a form of compensation for the years of 
inner preoccupation 
the comparative study 
of the individuation process 
jung had been familiar with alchemical texts from around  
in  theodore flournoy had presented a psychqlogical 
interpretation of alchemy in his lectures at the university of 
geneva and in  herbert silberer published an extensive 
work on the subject jungs approach to alchemy followed 
the work of flournoy and silberer in regarding alchemy from 
a psychological perspective his understanding of it was based 
on two main theses first that in meditating on the texts and 
materials in their laboratories the alchemists were actually 
practicing a form of active imagination second that the 
symbolism in the alchemical texts corresponded to that of the 
individuation process with which jung and his patients had 
been engaged 
in the s jungs activity shifted from working on his 
fantasies in the black books to his alchemy copy books in these he 
presented an encyclopedic collection of excerpts from alchemical 
literature and related works which he indexed according to key 
words and subjects these copy books formed the basis of his 
writings on the psychology of alchemy 
after  jung put liber novus to one side while he had 
stopped working directly on it it still remained at the center 
of his activity in his therapeutic work he continued to attempt 
to foster similar devefbpments in his patients and to establish 
which aspects of his own experience were singular and which 
had some generality and applicability to others in his symbolic 
researches jung was interested in parallels to the imagery and 
conceptions of liber n ovus the question that he pursued was the 
following was something alan to the individuation process to be 
found in all cultures if so what were the common and differential introduction i  
elements in this perspective jungs work after  could be 
considered as an extended amplification of the contents of liber 
novus and an attempt to translate its contents into a form accept
able to the contemporary outlook some of the statelnents made 
in liber n ovus closely correspond to positions that jung would 
later articulate in his published works and represent their first 
formulations on the other hand much did not directly find 
its way into the collected works or was presented in a schematic 
form or through allegory and indirect allusion thus liber n ovus 
enables a hitherto unsuspected clarification of the most difficult 
aspects of jungs collected works one is simply not in a position to 
comprehend the genesis of jungs late work nor to fully under
stand what he was attempting to achieve without studying liber 
novus at the same time the collected works can in part be 
considered an indirect commentary on liber n ovus each mutually 
explicates the other 
jung saw his confrontation with the unconscious as the source 
of his later work he recalled that all his work and everything 
that he subsequently achieved came from these imaginings he 
had expressed things as well as he was able in clumsy handi
capped language he often felt as if gigantic blocks of stone 
were tumbling down upon him one thunderstorm followed 
another he was amazed it hadnt broken him as it had done 
others such as schreber 
when asked by kurt wolff in  on the relation between 
his scholarly works and his biographical notes of dreams and 
fantasies jung replied 
that was the primal stuff that compelled me to work on it 
and my work is a more or less successful attempt to incorporate 
this incandescent matter into the worldview of my time 
the first imaginings and dreams were like fiery molten 
basalt from which the stone crystallized upon which i 
could worko 
he added that it has cost me  years so to speak to bring the 
things that i once experienced and wrote down into the vessel of 
my scientific work 
in jungs own terms liber novus could be considered to 
contain among other things an account of stages of his process 
of individuation in subsequent works he tried to point out 
the general schematic common elements to which he could find 
parallels in his patients and in comparative research the later 
works thus present a skeletal outline a basic sketch but left out 
the main body of detail in retrospect he described the red book 
as an attempt to formulate things in terms of revelation he had 
hope that this would free him but found that it didnt he then 
realized that he had to return to the human side and to science he 
had to draw conclusions from the insights the elaboration of 
the material in the red book was vital but he also had to under
stand the ethical obligations in doing so he had paid with his 
life and his science

 i liber novus 
in  he commenced a series of seminars on the fantasy 
visions of christiana morgan at the psychological club in zurich 
which can in part be regarded as an indirect commentary on 
liber n ovus to demonstrate the empiral validity of the concep
tions that he derived in the latter he had to show that processes 
depicted within it were not unique 
with his seminars on kundalini yoga in  jung commenced 
a comparative study of esoteric practices focusing on the spiritual 
exercises of ignatius of loyola patanjalis yoga sutras buddhist 
meditational practices and medieval alchemy which he presented 
in an extensive series of lectures at the swiss federal institute 
of technology eth the critical insight that enabled these 
linkages and comparisons was jungs realization that these 
practices were all based on different forms of active imagina
tion and that they all had as their goal the transformation of 
the personalitywhich jung understood as the process of 
individuation thus jungs eth lectures provide a comparative 
history of active imagination the practice that formed the basis 
of liber novus 
in  he published his first extended case description of 
the individuation process which was that of kristine mann 
who had painted an extensive series of mandalas he referred 
to his own undertalcing 
i have naturally used this method on myself too and can 
affirm that one can paint very complicated pictures without 
having the least idea of their real meaning while painting 
them the picture seems to develop out of itself and often 
in opposition to ones conscious intentions 
 he noted that the present work filled a gap in his description 
of his therapeutic methods as he had written little about active 
imagination he had used this method since  but only 
sketched it in the relations of the i to the unconscious in  and 
first mentioned the mandala in  in his commentary on the 
secret of the golden flower 
for at least thirteen years i kept quiet about the results 
of these methods in order to avoid any suggestion i wanted 
to assure myself that these thingsmandalas especially
really are produced spontaneously and were not suggested 
to the patient by my own fantasy 
through his historical studies he convinced himself that mandalas 
had been produced in all times and places he also noted that 
they were produced by patients of psychotherapists who were 
not his students this also indicates one consideration that may 
have led him not to publish liber n ovus to convince himself and 
his critics that the developments of his patients and especially 
their mandala images were not simply due to suggestion he 
held that the mandala represented one of the best examples of 
the universality of an archetype in  he also noted that he 
himself had used the method of active imagination over a long 
period of time and observed many symbols that he had been 
able to verify only years later in texts that had been unknown 
to him however from an evidential standpoint given the 
breadth of his learning jungs own material would not have been a particularly convincing example of his thesis that images 
from the collective unconscious spontaneously emerged without 
prior acquaintance 
in liber n ovus jung articulated his understanding of the 
historical transformations of christianity and the historicity 
of symbolic formations he took up this theme in his writings on 
the psychology of alchemy and on the psychology of christian 
dogmas and most of all in answer tojob as we have seen it was 
jungs view that his prewar visions were prophetic that led to 
the composition of liber novus in  through his collabora
tion with the nobel prizewinning physicist wolfgang pauli 
jung argued that there existed a principle of acausal orderedness 
that underlay such meaningful coincidences which he called 
synchronicity he claimed that under certain circumstances 
the constellation of an archetype led to a relativization of time 
and space which explained how such events could happen 
this was an attempt to expand scientific understanding to 
accommodate events such as his visions of  and  
it is important to note that the relation of liber n ovus to 
jungs scholarly writings did not follow a straight pointby
point translation and elaboration as early as  jung sought to 
convey some of the results of his experiments in a scholarly 
language while continuing with the elaboration of his fantasies 
one would do best to regard liber n ovus and the black books as 
representing a private opus that ran parallel to and alongside 
his public scholarly opus whilst the latter was nourished by 
and drew from the former they remained distinct after ceasing 
to work on liber n ovus he continued to elaborate his private 
opushis own mythologyin his work on the tower and in 
his stone carvings and paintings here liber n ovus functioned 
as a generating center and a number of his paintings and 
carvings relate to it in psychotherapy jung sought to enable 
his patients to recover a sense of meaning in life through 
facilitating and supervising their own selfexperimentation and 
symbol creation at the same time he attempted to elaborate a 
general scientific psychology 
the publication 
of liber n ovus 
while jung had stopped working directly on liber novus the 
question of what to do with it remained and the issue of its 
eventual publication remained open on april   jung 
replied to mary mellon concerning a printing of the sermones 
concerning the printing of the seven sermones i should 
wish you to wait for a while i had in mind to add certain material 
but i have hesitated for years to do it but at such an occasion 
one might risk it in  he had a major heart attack and 
did not see this plan through 
in  lucy heyer put forward a project for a biography of 
jung at olga froebes suggestion and on jungs insistence 
cary baynes began collaborating with lucy heyer on this project 
cary baynes considered writing a biography of jung based on liber 
novus to jungs disappointment she withdrew from the project 
after several years of interviews with lucy heyer jung terminated

her progress in  kurt wolff proposed another biographical 
project which became memories dreams rejfections at some stage 
jung gave aniela jaffe a copy of the draft of liber novus which had 
been made by toni wolff jung authorized jaffe to cite from liber 
novus and the black books in memories dreams rejfectionso in his 
interviews with aniela jaffe jung discussed liber novus and his 
selfexperimentation unfortunately she did not reproduce all 
his comments 
on october   she wrote to jack barrett of the bollingen 
foundation concerning liber n ovus and informed him that jung 
had suggested that it and the black books be given to the library of 
the university of basel with a restriction of  years  years or 
longer as he hates the idea that anybody should read this material 
without knowing the relations to his life etc she added that she had 
decided not to use much of this material in memories
 in one early 
manuscript of memories jaffe had included a transcription of 
the draft typescript of most of liber primus but it was omitted 
from the final manuscript and she did not cite from liber n ovus 
or the black books in the german edition of memories jaffe 
included jungs epilogue to liber novus as an appendix jungs 
flexible date stipulations concerning access to liber n ovus were 
similar to that which he gave around the same time concerning 
the publication of his correspondence with freud 
on october   jung told jaffe that he had never finished 
the red book according to jaffe in the spring of the year  
jung after a time of lengthy illhealth took up liber novus again to 
complete the last remaining unfinished image once again he 
took up the transcription of the manuscript into the calligraphic 
volume jaffe notes however he still could not or would not 
 complete it he told me that it had to do with death the cal
ligraphic transcription breaks off midsentence and jung added 
an afterword which also broke off midsentence the postscript 
and jungs discussions of its donation to an archive suggest that 
jung was aware that the work would eventually be studied at 
some stage after jungs death liber novus remained with his 
family in accordance with his will 
in her  eranos lecture the creative phases in jungs life 
jaffe cited two passages from the draft of liber novus noting that 
jung placed a copy of the manuscript at my disposal with permission 
to quote from it as occasion arose this was the only time she did 
so pictures from liber n ovus were also shown in a bbe documen
tary on jung narrated by laurens van der post in  these 
created widespread interest in it in  after the much acclaimed 
publication ofrhe freud ung letters william mcguire representing introduction i  
princeton university press wrote to the lawyer of the jung estate 
hans karrer with a publication proposal for liber n ovus and a 
collection of photographs of jungs stone carvings paintings 
and the tower he proposed a facsimile edition possibly with
out the text he wrote that we are uninformed of the number 
of its pages the relative amount of text and pictures and the 
content and interest of the text no one in the press had 
actually seen or read the work or knew much about it this 
request was denied 
in  some reproductions from the calligraphic volume 
of liber n ovus wee displayed at an exhibition commemorating 
jungs centenary in zurich in  nine paintings from liber 
novus were published by jaffe in c g lung word and image and 
in  a few other related paintings wre published by gerhard 
wehr in his illustrated biography of jung 
in  liber novus was professionally photographed and 
five facsimile editions were prepared these were given to the five 
families directly descendent from jung in  jungs family 
who had supported the publication of jungs collected works 
in german completed in  commenced an examination 
of jungs unpublished materials as a result of my researches 
i found one transcription and a partial transcription of liber 
novus and presented them to the jung heirs in around the 
same time another transcription was presented to the heirs 
by marielouise von franz i was invited to present reports 
on the subject and its suitability for publication and made a 
presentation on the subject on the basis of these reports and 
discussions the heirs decided in may  to release the work 
for publication 
the work on liber novus was at the center of jungs 
selfexperimentation it is nothing less than the central book in 
his oeuvre with its publication one is now in a position to study 
what took place there on the basis of primary documentation as 
opposed to the fantasy gossip and speculation that makes up 
too much of what is written on jung and to grasp the genesis 
and constitution of jungs later work for nearly a century such 
a reading has simply not been possible and the vast literature on 
jungs life and work that has arisen has lacked access to the single 
most important documentary source this publication marks 
a caesura and opens the possibility of a new era in the under
standing of jungs work it provides a unique window into how 
he recovered his soul and in so doing constituted a psychology 
thus this introduction does not end with a conclusion but with 
the promise of a new beginning 
 jung to jaffe october   bollingen archives library of congress 
 bollingen archives library of congress jaffe gave a similar account to kurt wolff mentioning  or  years as the possible restriction undated received 
october  kurt wolff papers beinecke library yale university on reading the first sections of the protocols of aniela jaffes interviews with jung cary 
baynes wrote to jung on january  that it is the right introduction to the red book and so i can die in peace on that score cfb 
 kurt wolff papers beinecke library yale university the prologue was omitted and it was given the title of the first chapter der wiederfindung der seele the recovery of 
the soul another copy of this section was heavily edited by an unidentified hand which may have been part of preparing this for publication at this time jfa 
 one may note that the publication of the freudjung letters crucial as this was in its own right while liber novus and the bulk of jungs other correspondences remained 
unpublished regrettably heightened the mistaken freudocentric view of jung as we see in liber novus jung is moving in a universe that is as far away from psycho
analysis as could be imagined

mark kyburz john peck and sonu shamdasani 
at the outset of liher n ovus jung experiences a crisis of language 
the spirit of the depths who immediately challenges jungs use 
of language along with the spirit of the time informs jung that 
on the terrain of his soul his achieved language will no longer 
serve his own powers of knowing and spealcing can no longer 
account for why he utters what he says or under what compulsion 
he spealcs all such attempts become arbitrary in the depth realm 
even murderous he is made to understand that what he might 
say on these occasions is both madness and instructively what 
is i indeed in a broader perspective the language that he will find 
for his inner experience would compose a vast commedia do 
you believe man of this time that laughter is lower than worship 
where is your measure false measurer the sum of life decides in 
laughter and in worship not your judgment 
in translating this accumulated record of jungs imaginal 
encounters with his inner figures from a sixteenyear period 
beginning just before the first world war we have let jung 
remain a man who was pulled loose from his ltioorings but also 
caught up in the maelstrom that has gone by the name of literary 
modernism we have tried neither to further modernize nor to 
render more archaic the language and forms in which he couched 
his personal record 
the language in liher novus pursues three main stylistic 
registers and each poses distinct difficulties for a translator one 
of them faithfully reports the fantasies and inner dialogues of jungs 
imaginal encounters while a second remains firmly and discern
ingly conceptual still a third writes in a mantic and prophetic or 
romantic and dithyrambic mode the relation between these 
reportorial reflective and romantic aspects of jungs language 
remains conledic in a manner that dante or goethe would have 
recognized that is within each chapter the descriptive conceptual 
and mantic registers consistently rub against each other while 
at the same time no single register is affected by its partners 
all three stylistic registers serve psychic promptings and each 
chapter shares a polyphonic mode with the others in the 
scrutinies section from  this polyphony matures its voices 
commingling in various ratios 
a reader will quicldy infer that this design was not premeditated 
but rather grew from the experiment to which jung arduously 
submitted the editorial note diagrams the textual evolution 
of this composition here we need only observe that jung each 
time sets down an initial protocol layer of narrative encounter 
usually with dialogue and then in the secnd layer a lyrical 
elaboration of and commentary on that encounter the first layer 
avoids an elevated tone whereas the second welcomes elevation 
and modulates into sermonic manticprophetic reflections on the 
episodes meaning which in turn unpack events discursively this 
mode of compositionwhich is unique in jungs workswas no 
temperamental arrangement instead as the episodes accumulated 
and their stakes mounted it grew into an experiment that was 
as much literary as it was psychological and spiritual in jungs 
extensive published and unpublished corpus there is no other 
text that was subjected to such careful and continual linguistic 
revision as liher novus 
i see below p  
 see below p  these three linguistic registers already present themselves as 
virtual models for a possible translation our practice has been 
to let them cohabit within the exploratory frameworks alive in 
jungs own day the task before him was to find a language rather 
than use one ready at hand the mantic and conceptual registers 
can themselves be considered as translations of the descriptive 
register that is these registers move from a literal level to symbolic 
ones that amplify it in a modern analogue to dantes modi diversi 
in his letter to can grande della scala in a very real sense liher 
novus was composed through intertextual translation the books 
rhetoric its manner of address emerges from this interanimating 
structure of internal translation or transvaluation a critical task for 
any translation of the work therefore is conveying this compositional 
texture in tact 
the fact that painted images of an accomplished and hybrid 
kind illuminate the medieval format of a folio in scribal hand 
compounds any reflections on the linguistic task the novel language 
required a renewed ancient script a polyphonic style couches itself 
multimedia fashion within a symbolic throwbackyetforward 
movement medieval and anticipatory into retrievals of psychic 
reality verbal and visual images press in on jung from the root 
past and present while aiming toward the beyond a layered 
medium emerges whose polyphonic style mirrors within its 
language that same composite layering 
faced with the task of translating a text composed nearly a 
hundred years ago translators usually have the benefit of prior 
models to consult as well as decades of scholarly commentary and 
criticism without such exemplars at hand we were left to imagine 
how the work nlight have been translated in previous decades 
consequently our translation sidesteps several unpublished or 
hypothetical models for rendering liher n ovus into english there 
is peter baynes strilcingly archaizing septem sermones of  
which draws largely upon a victorian idiom or the conceptu
ally rationalizing version that rfc hull might have attempted 
had he been allowed to translate it alongside his other volumes 
in the bollingen series of jungs collected works or the elegant 
literary rendering from the hand of soltieone like r j hollingdale 
our version therefore occupies an actual position in a largely 
virtual sequence consideration of these virtual models highlighted 
questions of how to pitch the language within historical shifts 
in english prose how to convey the myriad convergences and 
divergences between the language of liher novus and jungs 
collected works and how to render in english a work simultaneously 
echoing luthers german and nietzsches parody of the same in 
thus spoke zarathustra because our version talces this position 
accordingly when we have cited jungs collected works we have 
freshly rendered or discreetly modified the published translations 
liher n ovus was coeval with the literary ferment that mikhail 
balchtin called the dialogical prose imagination the anglowelsh 
writer and artist david jones author of in parenthesis and the 
anathemata referred to the rupture of the first world war and 
its effects on the historical sense of writers artists and thinkers 
simply as the break in concert with other experimental writing 
from these decades liher n ovus excavates archaeological layers of 
literary adventure with hardwon consciousness as both shovel and 
precious shard while jung actively considered publishing liher 
n ovus for many years he chose not to make a name for himself in

this literary manneras much for style as for contentby releasing it 
by ii with psychological types he already found that his sanctum 
could furnish him his main themes through translation into a 
scholarly idiom 
jung enunciates the tension among his three stylistic registers 
already addressing a future readershipwhich shifts from an 
inner circle of friends to a wider public between different layers 
of the text this is graphically apparent in the frequent pronomial 
shifts between the versions which show the manner in which 
he was constantly reimagining the potential readers of the text 
jung coherently adopted this dialogical stancepolyphonic in 
balchtins later termsonce again mindful of a hypothetical 
future audience yet also aloof from the question of audience 
altogether not from pride but simply in view of the aims to be 
served paintings and fantasies from this private treasury entered 
anonymously as crypted intertexts into jungs later work nestling 
as hermetic clues to the undisclosed whole of his effort 
indeed we can imagine jung laughing when he wrote of 
 case z in the last section of his essay on the psychological 
aspects of the kore ii there he summarizes as anonymous 
twelve episodes from encounters with his own soul in liber novus 
calling them a dreamseries the comments he appends to 
these propel the adventurer he had been and the subject he 
became in that adventure into the discourse of a wouldbe science 
the comedy is both spacious and exquisite this respectful host 
to the anima also wields the diagnostic pointer in all seriousness 
his language flexibly straddled both contexts but also kept 
certain veils in place while doing so this linguistic strategy 
mirrored jungs larger aims in remaining fruitfully dual and 
contextual declaring his mysteries to be particular not to be 
aped in any way he nonetheless also offered them as a template 
of formative spiritual process and in so doing attempted to 
develop an idiom that could be taken up by others to articulate 
their experiences 
this is one way of paraphrasing the considerable anomaly of 
the language that jung had to find through sleepless nights from 
ii onward that language shifted its shape altered its scale 
and weighed both megrims and tons therefore it comes as 
no surprise that in his more elevated passages jung relied on 
the resonance of the luther bible itself a translation that had 
achieved rocklike stability within german culture ein jeste burg 
a mighty fortress thus our own reliance here on the king james 
version of the bible kjv for comparable tonalities in english 
yet a paradox rises immediately what jung counted on in that 
resonance had transplanted an alien spirit into the germanic 
heimat or home as one may likewise say of the kjvs deep embed
ding of the same implant in anglosaxon culture franz rosenzweig 
translating parts of the old testament with martin buber in the 
midis identified luthers bible as the great spacemaker 
within germanic spirit precisely through luthers closein moves 
 cw  translators note i  
toward his source for the comfort of our souls we must retain 
such words must put up with them and so give the hebrew 
some room where it does better than german can thus our 
own practice of not smoothing out jungs several modes or 
malcing them run more fluently than need be or even regularizing 
his punctuation think of dantes shaggy diction or of still 
another maxim from luther in rosenzweigs notes the mud 
will cling to the wheel 
yet even these profound allowances for archaic and original 
speech across abysses of ineaning fail to approximate the 
destabilizing experience in and through language to which jung 
testifies his late comments in the published memoir on his 
reservations about highflown styleo in effect cover his tracks in 
liber novus the original experience sent speech into a spin that 
animates the books initiatic dimension language too undergoes 
a descent into hell and the realm of the dead which divests one 
of speech even as it renews the capacity for utterance 
the following instances give some idea of this factors range 
mapping the stresses in any sincere ventriloquism such as jung 
risked by undertalcing a controlled seance with himself and his 
ground with pen in hand hlderlins hairbreadth space warps 
and isaiahs tongueborne burning coal both move in this league 
along with plato on right frenzy or divine inadness imy soul 
spoke to me in a whisper urgently and alarmingly words words 
do not make too many words be silent and listen have you 
recognized your madness and do you admit it have you noticed 
that all your foundations are all completely mired in madness  
 jungs soul there are hellish webs of words only words  
be tentative with words value them  for you are the first who 
gets snared in them for words have meanings with words you 
pull up the underworld word the paltriest and the mightiest 
in words the emptiness and the fullness flow together hence 
the word is an image of the godi  but if the word is a 
symbol it means everything when the way enters death and 
we are surrounded by rot and horror the way rises in the dark
ness and leaves the mouth as the saving symbol the wordi  
the dead woman let me have the word oh that you cannot 
hearl how difficultgive me the wordli it then materializes in 
jungs hand as hap the phallus  jungs soul you possess the 
word that should not be allowed to remain concealedi  jung 
what is my word it is the stammering of a minor   soul they 
do not see the fire they do not believe your words but they see 
your mark and unknowingly suspect you to be the messenger of 
the burning agony  you stutter you stammeri in the protocols 
for his memoir jung recalls bringing to the original experiences 
in liber n ovus only a highly clumsy speechi yet one instance 
 strongly belies that later emphasis i knew that philemon 
had intoxicated me and given me a language that was foreign to 
me and of a different sensitivity all of this faded when the god 
arose and only philemon kept that languagei

this last instance indicates that jung later attributed the 
mantic dithyrambic speech of layer two in everything before the 
scrutinies section to philemon the literal intoxication described 
here is linguistic a dramatized ventriloquial version of platonic 
divine madness it therefore underscores our attempt to faithfully 
render the stylistic registers of liber n ovus so as to present a 
vital aspect of jungs literary experiment as he grapples with 
attempting to find the most fitting idiom in which to cast the 
transformations of inner experience jungs search for the soul 
then stands at one with the search for appropriately dialogical 
and differentiated language 
these instances in all their oscillations affect a reading of 
jungs collected works and counsel caution with applying its 
conceptual tools to the task of reading and understanding liber 
n ovus to take but one example one begins to see that it is too 
neat to equate the opposed yet related depths of logos and eros 
with the conceptual and lyricalantic registers found in liber 
novus jungs commentary on the elijahsalome relation
ship included here shows that relationship to be developmental a 
mystery play of the formative process that kindles love for the 
lowest in us the modal span for language in liber n ovus thus 
animates that mystery play but does not correspond directly to 
opposed psychological functions 
 see appendix b 
 mp p  this complex respect for language instructs translators of 
liber novus in navigating the underworldredemptive tensions 
spanned by its rhetoric the great force behind the mantic tension in 
that rhetoric occupied jung in the brief epilogue he inscribed 
in the calligraphic volume in  two years before his death 
once again plying the seas of those illuminated pages he seems to 
have found any further summingup to be unnecessary brealang 
off in midsentence he left the book to stand on its own as one strand 
of discourse within his whole effort that counterpoint required 
no comment any more than did the three registers of language 
within the book itself ordeal was commedia after all calling for no 
retrospective theoretical justification liber n ovus would survive 
the gropings and peltings of reception jung had remarked in 
 to aniela jaffe that so much rubbish had been said about 
him that any more didnt disturb him that lifted pen therefore 
confidently consigned the book to its depth trajectory steeply 
expanding into the quarry it had become with both his collected 
works and the lakeside tower at bollingen as its final extractions 
in this note we have attempted to convey only the general 
principles that have guided this translation a full discussion of 
the choices that confronted us and a justification of the decisions 
talcen would fill a volume as ample as this one

editorial note 
sonu shamdasani 
liber n ovus is an unfinished manuscript corpus and it is not 
completely clear how jung intended to complete it or how he 
would have published it had he decided to do so we have a 
series of manuscripts of which no single version can be taken 
as final consequently the text could be presented in a variety of 
ways this note indicates the editorial rationale behind the present 
edition 
the following is the sequence of extant manuscripts for liber 
primus and liber secundus 
black books  november iiapril

handwritten draft circa

cary bayness transcription   pages incomplete 
the arrangement presented here starts with a revision of cary 
bayness transcription and a fresh transcription of the remain
ing material in the calligraphic volume together with the typed 
draft of scrutinies with linebyline comparisons with all extant 
versions the last thirty pages are completed from the draft the 
main variations between the different manuscripts concern the 
second layer of the text these changes represent jungs continued 
work of comprehending the psychological significance of the 
fantasies as jung considered liber novus to be an attempt at an 
elaboration in terms of the revelation the changes between the 
different versions present this attempt at an elaboration and 
therefore are an important part of the work itself thus the 
notes indicate significant changes between the different ver
sions and they present material that clarifies the meaning or 
context of a particular section each manuscript layer is impor
tant and interesting and a publication of all of themwhich 
would run to several thousand pageswould be a task for the 
future 
the criterion for including passages from the earlier 
manuscripts has been simply the question does this inclusion 
help the reader comprehend what is talcing place aside from 
the intrinsic importance of these changes noting them in the 
footnotes serves a second purposeit shows how carefully jung 
worked at continually revising the text editorial note i  
the corrected draft has two layers of corrections by jung the 
first set of corrections appears to have been done after the draft 
was typed and before the transcription into the calligraphic 
volume as it appears that it was this tianuscript that jung 
transcribed a further set of corrections on approxitiately 
 pages of the typescript appears to have been made after 
the calligraphic volume and i would estimate that these were 
done sometime in the midisthese corrections tiodernize 
the language and bring the terminology into relation with jungs 
terminology from the period of psychological types additional 
clarifications are also added jung even corrected material in 
the draft that was deleted in the calligraphic volume i have 
presented some of the significant changes in the footnotes 
from them it is possible for a reader to see how jung would 
have revised the whole text had he ctipleted this layer of cor
rections 
subdivisions have been added in liber secundus chapter  
the magician and in scrutinies for ease of reference these are 
indicated by numbers in scrolled brackets   where possible 
the date of each fantasy has been given from the black bools the 
second layer added in the draft is indicated by  and the 
manuscript reverts to the sequence of the fantasies in the blacl 
books at the beginning of the following chapter in the pas
sages where subdivisions have been added the reversion to the 
sequence of the black books is indicated by i 
the various manuscripts have different systems of 
paragraphing in the draft paragraphs often consist of one or 
two sentences and the text is presented like a prose poem 
at the other extreme in the calligraphic volume there are 
lengthy passages of text with  paragraph breaks the most 
logical paragraphing appears in cary bayness transcription 
she frequently took her cue for paragraph breaks from the 
presence of colored initials because it is unlikely that she 
would have reparagraphed the text without jungs approval her 
layout has formed the point of departure for this edition in some 
instances the paragraphing has been brought closer into line 
with the draft and the calligraphic volume in the second half 
of her transcription cary baynes transcribed the draft because 
the calligraphic volume had not been completed here i have 
paragraphed the text in the same manner as established before 
i believe that this presents the text in the clearest and easiest
tofollow form 
in the calligraphic volume jung illustrated certain initials 
and wrote some in red and blue and stietimes increased the 
font of the text the layout here attempts to follow these 
conventions because the initials in question arent always the 
same in english and german the choice of which initial to set 
in red in the english has been governed by its corresponding 
 location in the text the bolding and increase of font size has 
been rendered by italics the remainder of the text beyond that 
which jung transcribed in the calligraphic volume has been set 
following the same conventions to maintain consistency in the 
case of the septem sermones the font coloring has followed jungs 
printed version of  
the decision to include scrutinies in sequence with and as 
part of liber n ovus is based on the following editorial rationale 
the material in the blacl books commences in novetiber  
liber secundus closes with material from april   and 
scrutinies commences with material frti the same day the black 
books run consecutively until july  and recommence on 
i interested readers may compare this edition with the sections from the draft in the kurt wolff papers at yale university and with cary bayness transcription 
at the contemporary medical archives at the wellcome collection london it is quite possible that other manuscripts may yet come to light 
 there are also some paint marks on this manuscript

 i liber novus 
june   in the hiatus jung wrote the handwritten draft 
when cary baynes transcribed liber novus between  
and  the first half of her transcription followed liber novus 
itself to the point reached by jung in his own transcription into 
the calligraphic volume it continues by following the draft and 
then proceeds  pages into scrutinies ending midsentence 
at the end of liber secundus jungs soul has ascended 
to heaven following the reborn god jung now thinks that 
philemon is a charlatan and comes to his i whom he must live 
with and educate scrutinies continues directly from this point 
with a confrontation with his i the ascent of the reborn 
god is referred to and his soul returns and explains why she 
had disappeared philemon reappears and instructs jung on 
how to establish the right relation to his soul the dead the 
gods and the daimons in scrutinies philemon fully emerges and 
takes on the significance that jung attached to him both in 
the  seminar and in memories only in scrutinies do certain 
episodes in liber primus and liber secundus become clear by the 
same token the narrative in scrutinies makes no sense if one has 
not read liber primus and liber secundus 
at two places in scrutinies liber primus and liber secundus are 
mentioned in a way that strongly suggests that they are all part of 
the same work 
and then the war broke out this opened my eyes about 
what i had experienced before and it also gave me the 
courage to say all that i havy written in the earlier part of 
this book 
since the god has ascended to the upper realms liahmnn 
has also become different he first appeared to me as a 
magician who lived in a distant land but then i felt his 
nearness and since the god has ascended i knew that 
 see below p  
 see below p  
sja 
ja liahmnn had intoxicated me and given me a language 
that was foreign to me and of a different sensitivity all of 
this faded when the god arose and only liahmqn kept 
that language but i felt that he went on other ways than i 
did probably the greater part of what i have written in the 
earlier part of this book was given to me by liahmqn 
these references to the earlier part of this book suggest that 
all of this indeed constitutes one book and that scrutinies was 
considered by jung to be part of liber novus 
this view is supported by the number of internal connections 
between the texts one example is the fact that the mandalas in 
liber n ovus are closely connected to the experience of the self and 
the realization of its centrality depicted only in scrutinies another 
example occurs in liber secundus chapter  when ezechiel and 
his fellow anabaptists arrive they tell jung that they are going 
to jerusalems holy places because they are not at peace not 
having fully finished with life in scrutinies the dead reappear 
telling jung that they have been to jerusalem but did not find 
what they sought there at that point philemon appears and 
the septem sermones begin perhaps jung intended to transcribe 
scrutinies into the calligraphic volume and illustrate it there are 
ample blank pages 
on january   cary baynes asked jung do you remember 
that you had me copy quite a bit of the red book itself while 
you were in africa i got as far as the beginning of the prufungen 
scrutinies this goes beyond what frau jaffe put at k ws kurt 
wolff disposal and he would like to read it is that oks jung 
replied on january  i have no objections against your lending 
your notes of the red book to mr wolff here cary baynes too 
seems to have regarded scrutinies as part of liber novus 
in citations in the notes ellipses have been indicated by three 
periods no emphases have been added

manu propria scriptum a c g lung anno domini mcmxv in domu sua 
kusnach turicense 
written by c g jung with his own hand in his house in 
kiisnachtziirich in the year  
 hi iv  if i speak in the spirit of this times i lnust say 
no one and nothing can justify what i must proclaim to you 
justification is superfluous to me since i have no choice but i 
must i have learned that in addition to the spirit of this time 
there is still another spirit at work namely that which rules the 
depths of everything contemporary the spirit of this tilne would 
like to hear of use and value i also thought this way and my 
humanity still thinks this way but that other spirit forces me 
nevertheless to speak beyond justification use and meaning 
filled with human pride and blinded by the presumptuous spirit 
of the times i long sought to hold that other spirit away from 
me but i did not consider that the spirit of the depths from 
time immemorial and for all the future possesses a greater power 
than the spirit of this time who changes with the generations 
the spirit of the depths has subjugated all pride and arrogance to 
the power of judgment he took away my belief in science he 
robbed me of the joy of explaining and ordering things and he let 
devotion to the ideals of this time die out in me he forced me 
down to the last and simplest things 
the spirit of the depths took my understanding and all my 
knowledge and placed them at the service of the inexplicable 
and the paradoxical he robbed me of speech and writing for 
everything that was not in his service namely the melting together 
of sense and nonsense which produces the supreme meaning 
but the supreme meaning is the path the way and the bridge to what is to 
come that is the god yet to come it is not the coming god himself but his 
image which appears in the supreme meaning god is an image and those 
who worship him must worship him in the images of the supreme meaning 
 medieval manuscripts were numbered by folios instead of pages the front side of the folio is the recto the righthand page of an open book and the back is the verso 
the lefthand of an open book in liber primus jung followed this practice he reverted to contemporary pagination in liber secundus 
 in  jung cited the first three verses of this passage from luthers bible noting the birth of the savior the development of the redeeming symbol takes place 
where one does not expect it and from precisely where a solution is most improbable psyctological types cw   
 in  jung cited this passage noting the nature of the redeeming symbol is that of a child that is the childlikeness or presuppositionlessness of the attitude belongs 
to the symbol and its function this childlike attitude necessarily brings with it another guiding principle in place of selfwill and rational intentions whose godlikeness 
is synonymous with superiority since it is of an irrational nature the guiding principle appears in a miraculous form isaiah expresses his connection very well   these 
honorific titles reproduce the essential qualities of the redeeming symbol the criterion of godlike effect is the irresistible power of the unconscious impulses 
psychological types cw   
 in  jung noted that the union of the opposites of the destructive and constructive powers of the unconscious paralleled the messianic state of fulfillment depicted 
in this passage mysterium coniunctionis cw   
 in goethes faust faust says to wagner what you call the spirit of the times  is fundamentally the gentlemans own mind  in which the times are reflected

innermost and lowermost  this i resisted since i hated nothing more than that which seemed to me unchaste and insolent p i

the supreme meaning is not a meaning and not an absurdity it is image 
and force in one magnificence and force together 
the supreme meaning is the beginning and the end it is the bridge of going 
across and fulfillment  
the other gods died oj their temporality yet the supreme meaning never 
dies it turns into meaning and then into absurdity and out of the fire and 
blood oj their collision the supreme meaning rises up rejuvenated anew 
the image of god has a shadow the supreme meaning is real and casts a 
shadow for what can be actual and corporeal and have no shadow 
the shadow is nonsense it lacks force and has no continued existence 
through itself but nonsense is the inseparable and undying brother of the 
supreme meaning 
like plants so men also grow some in the light others in the shadows 
there are many who need the shadows and not the light 
the image of god throws a shadow that is just as great as itself 
the supreme meaning is great and sman it is as wide as the space of the 
starry heaven and as narrow as the cell of the living body 
the spirit of this time in me wanted to recognize the great
ness and extent of the supreme meaning but not its littleness 
the spirit of the depths however conquered this arrogance and 
i had to swallow the small as a means of healing the immortal in 
me it completely burnt up my innards since it was inglorious and 
unheroic it was even ridiculous and revolting but the pliers of 
the spirit of the depths held me and i had to drink the bitterest 
of all draughts 
the spirit of this time tempted me with the thought that all 
this belongs to the shadowiness of the godimage this would 
be pernicious deception since the shadow is nonsense but the 
small narrow and banal is not nonsense but one of both of the 
essences of the godhead 
i resisted recognizing that the everyday belongs to the image 
of the godhead i fled this thought i hid myself behind the 
highest and coldest stars 
but the spirit of the depths caught up with me and forced the 
bitter drink between my lips io 
the spirit of this time whispered to me this supreme 
meaning this image of god this melting together of the hot 
and the cold that is you and only you but the spirit of the 
depths spoke to me iiyou are an image of the unending world 
all the last mysteries of becoming and passing away live in you 
if you did not possess all this how could you know 
for the sale of my human weakness the spirit of the depths 
gave me this word yet this word is also superfluous since i 
do not speal it freely but because i must i speak because the 
spirit robs me of joy and life if i do not spealcl i am the serf who 
brings it and does not know what he carries in his hand it would 
burn his hands if he did not place it where his master orders him 
to lay it 
the spirit of our time spoke to me and said what dire 
urgency could be forcing you to speak all this this was an 
awful temptation i wanted to ponder what inner or outer 
bind could force me into this and because i found nothing that i could grasp i was near to making one up but with 
this the spirit of our time had almost brought it about that 
instead of speaking i was thinking again about reasons and 
explanations but the spirit of the depths spoke to me and 
said to understand a thing is a bridge and possibility of 
returning to the path but to explain a matter is arbitrary and 
sometimes even murder have you counted the murderers 
among the scholars 
but the spirit of this time stepped up to me and laid before 
me huge volumes which contained all my knowledge their pages 
were made of ore and a steel stylus had engraved inexorable 
words in them and he pointed to these inexorable words and 
spoke to me and said what you speak that is madness 
it is true it is true what i speak is the greatness and intoxication 
and ugliness of madness 
but the spirit of the depths stepped up to me and said what 
you speak is the greatness is the intoxication is the undignified 
sick paltry dailiness is it runs in all the streets lives in all the 
houses and rules the day of all humanity even the eternal stars 
are commonplace it is the great mistress and the one essence of 
god one laughs about it and laughter too is do you believe 
man of this time that laughter is lower than worship where is 
your measure false measurer the sum of life decides in laughter 
and in worship not your judgment 
i must also speal the ridiculous you coming men you will 
recognize the supreme meaning by the fact that he is laughter 
and worship a bloody laughter and a bloody worship a sacrificial 
blood binds the poles those who know this laugh and worship in 
the same breath 
after this however my humanity approached me and said 
what solitude what coldness of desolation you lay upon 
me when you speak such reflect on the destruction of being 
and the streams of blood from the terrible sacrifice that the 
depths demandi 
but the spirit of the depths said no one can or should halt 
sacrifice sacrifice is not destruction sacrifice is the foundation 
stone of what is to come have you not had monasteries have 
not countless thousands gone into the desert you should carry 
the monastery in yourself the desert is within you the desert 
calls you and draws you back and if you were fettered to the 
world of this time with iron the call of the desert would breal all 
chains truly i prepare you for solitude 
after this my humanity remained silent something happened 
to my spirit however which i must call mercy 
my speech is imperfect not because i want to shine with 
words but out of the impossibility of finding those words 
i speak in images with nothing else can i express the words 
from the depths 
the mercy which happened to me gave me belief hope and 
sufficient daring not to resist further the spirit of the depths but 
to utter his word but before i could pull myself together to really 
do it i needed a visible sign that would show me that the spirit of 
 the terms hinubergehen going across obergang goingacross untergang downgoing and brucke bridge feature in nietzsches zarathustra in relation to the 
passage from man to the obermensch superman for example what is great in man is that he is a  and not a mill what can be loved in man is that he is a gqillg

the depths in me was at the same time the ruler of the depths of 
world affairs 
isit happened in october of the year  as i was leaving alone 
for a journey that during the day i was suddenly overcome in 
broad daylight by a vision i saw a terrible flood that covered all 
the northern and lowlying lands between the north sea and the 
alps it reached from england up to russia and from the coast of 
the north sea right up to the alps i saw yellow waves swimming 
rubble and the death of countless thousands 
this vision lasted for two hours it confused me and made me 
ill i was not able to interpret it two weeks passed then the vision 
returned still more violent than before and an inner voice spoke 
look at it it is completely real and it will come to pass you cannot 
doubt this i wrestled again for two hours with this vision but it 
held me fast it left me exhausted and confused and i thought my 
mind had gone crazyi 
from then on the anxiety toward the terrible event that stood 
directly before us kept coming back once i also saw a sea of blood 
over the northern lands 
in the year  in the month of june at the beginning and end of 
the month and at the beginning of july i had the same dream three 
times i was in a foreign land and suddenly overnight and right in 
the middle of summer a terrible cold descended from space all seas 
and rivers were locked in ice every green living thing had frozen 
the second dream was thoroughly similar to this but the third 
dream at the beginning of july went as follows 
i was in a remote english landi it was necessary that i return 
to my homeland with a fast ship as speedily as possiblei i reached 
home quicldyi in my homeland i found that in the middle of 
summer a terrible cold had fallen from space which had turned 
every living thing into ice there stood a leafbearing but fruit
less tree whose leaves had turned into sweet grapes full of healing 
juice through the working of the frosto i picked some grapes 
and gave them to a great waiting throngi 
in reality now it was so at the time when the great war 
broke out between the peoples of europe i found myself in 
scotland compelled by the war to choose the fastest ship and 
the shortest route home i encountered the colossal cold that 
froze everything i met up with the flood the sea of blood and 
found my barren tree whose leaves the frost had transformed into 
a remedy and i plucked the ripe fruit and gave it to you and i do 
not know what i poured out for you what bittersweet intoxicating 
drink which left on your tongues an aftertaste of blood 
believe me it is no teaching and no instruction that i give you on 
is the corrected drqft has i beginning p  refinding the soul i  
what basis should i presume to teach your i give you news of the way of 
this man but not of your own way my path is not your path therefore i 
 cannot teach you  the way is within us but not in gods nor in teachings 
nor in laws within us is the way the truth and the life 
woe betide those who live by way of examples life is not with them if 
you live according to an example you thus live the life of that example but 
who should live your own life if not yourselfr so live yourselves  
the signposts have fallen unblazed trails lie before us do not be greedy 
to gobble up the fruits of foreign fields do you not know that you yourselves 
are the firtile acre which bears everything that avails your 
yet who today knows thisr who knows the way to the eternally fruitful 
climes of the soulr you seek the way through mere appearances you study 
books and give ear to all kinds of opinion what good is all thatr 
there is only one way and that is your way  
you seek the pathr i warn you away from my own it can also be the 
wrong way for you 
may each go his own way 
i will be no savior no lawgiver no master teacher unto you you are no 
longer little children  
giving laws wanting improvements making things easier has all become 
wrong and evil may each one seek out his own way the way leads to 
mutual love in community men will come to see and fiel the similarity and 
commonality of their ways 
laws and teachings held in common compel people to solitude so that 
they may escape the pressure of undesirable contact but solitude makes people 
hostile and venomous 
therefore give people dignity and let each of them stand apart so that each 
may find his own fillowship and love it 
power stands against power contempt against contempt love against love 
give humanity dignity and trust that life will find the better way 
the one eye of the godhead is blind the oneear of the godhead is deaf 
the order of its being is crossed by chaos so be patient with the crippledness of 
the world and do not overvalue its consummate beauty

 when i hd the vision of the flood in october of the year 
 it happened at a time that was significant for me as a lnan 
at that time in the fortieth year of my life i had achieved everything 
that i had wished for myself i had achieved honor power wealth 
knowledge and every human happiness then my desire for the 
 jung discussed this vision on several occasions stressing different details in his  seminar analytical psychology p f to mircea eliade see above p  and in 
memories pp  jung was on the way to schaffhausen where his motherinlaw lived her fiftyseventh birthday was on october the journey by train takes 
about one hour 
 the drqft continues with a friend whose lack of farsightedness and whose improvidence i had in reality often noted p  
 the drqft continues my friend however wanted to return on a small and slower ship which i considered stupid and imprudent p  
 the drqft continues and there i found strangely enough my friend who had evidently talcen the same faster ship without my noticing pp  
 ice wine is made by leaving grapes on the vine until they are frozen by frost they are then pressed and the ice is removed leading to a highly concentrated delectable 
sweet wine 
 the drqft continues this was my dream all my efforts to understand it were in vain i labored for days its impression however was powerful p  jung also 
recounted this dream in memories p  
 see introduction p i 
 in the drqft this is addressed to my friends p  
 cf the contrast to john  jesus said unto him i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me 
 the drqft continues this is not a law but notice of the fact that the time of example and law and of the straight line drawn in advance has become overripe p io 
 the drqft continues my tongue shall wither if i serve up laws if i prattle to you about teachings those who seek such will leave my table hungry p  
 the drqft continues only one law exists and that is your law only one truth exists and that is your truth p io 
 the drqft continues one should not turn people into sheep but sheep into people the spirit of the depth demands this who is beyond present and past speak and 
write for those who want to listen and read but do not run after men so that you do not soil the dignity of humanityit is a rare good a sad deniise in dignity is better 
than an undignified healing whoever wants to be a doctor of the soul sees people as being sick he offends human dignity it is presumptuous to say that man is sick 
whoever wants to be the souls shepherd treats people like sheep he violates human dignity it is insolent to say that people are like sheep who gives you the right to 
say that man is sick and a sheep give him human dignity so he may find his ascendancy or downfall his way p ii 
 the drqft continues this is all my dear friends that i can tell you about the grounds and aims of my message which i am burdened with like the patient donlcey with 
a heavy load he is glad to put it down p

increase of these trappings ceased the desire ebbed from me 
and horror came over me the vision of the flood seized me 
and i felt the spirit of th depths but i did not understand 
him yet he drove me on with unbearable inner longing and 
i said 
 my soul where are you do you hear me i speak i call 
youare you there i have returned i am here again i have 
shaken the dust of all the lands froln my feet and i have come 
to you i am with you after long years of long wandering i 
have come to you again should i tell you everything i have 
seen experienced and drunk in or do you not want to hear 
about all the noise of life and the world but one thing you 
must know the one thing i have learned is that one must live 
this life 
this life is the way the long soughtafter way to the 
unfatholnable which we call divine there is no other way 
all other ways are false paths i found the right way it led me to 
you to my soul i return tempered and purified do you still 
know me how long the separation lasted everything has become 
so different and how did i find you how strange my journey 
was what words should i use to tell you on what twisted paths 
a good star has guided me to you give me your hand my almost 
forgotten soul how warm the joy at seeing you again you long 
disavowed soul life has led me back to you let us thank the 
life i have lived for all the happy and all the sad hours for every 
joy for every sadness my soul my journey should continue with 
you i will wander with you and ascend to my solitude 
 the spirit of the depths forced me to say this and at the 
same time to undergo it against mysel since i had not expected 
it then i still labored misguidedly under the spirit of this time 
and thought differently about the human soul i thought and 
spoke much of the soul i knew inany learned words for her i 
had judged her and turned her into a scientific objecti i did 
not consider that my soul cannot be the object of my judgment 
and knowledge much more are my judgment and knowledge the objects of my soul therefore the spirit of the depths forced me 
to speal to my soul to call upon her as a living and selfexisting 
being i had to become aware that i had lost my soul 
from this we learn how the spirit of the depths considers the 
soul he sees her as a living and selfexisting being and with this 
he contradicts the spirit of this time for whom the soul is a thing 
dependent on man which lets herself be judged and arranged 
and whose circumference we can grasp i had to accept that what 
i had previously called my soul was not at all my soul but a 
dead system hence i had to speal to my soul as to something 
far off and unknown which did not exist through me but through 
whom i existed 
he whose desire turns away from outer things reaches the 
place of the soul if he does not find the soul the horror of 
emptiness will overcome him and fear will drive him with a whip 
lashing time and again in a desperate endeavor and a blind desire 
for the hollow things of the world he becolnes a fool through 
his endless desire and forgets the way of his soul never to find 
her again he will run after all things and will seize hold of 
them but he will not find his soul since he would find her only 
in himself truly his soul lies in things and men but the blind 
one seizes things and men yet not his soul in things and inen he 
has no knowledge of his soul how could he tell her apart from 
things and men he could find his soul in desire itsel but not 
in the objects of desire if he possessed his desire and his desire 
did not possess him he would lay a hand on his soul since his 
desire is the image and expression of his soul  
if we possess the image of a thing we possess half the thing 
the image of the world is half the world he who possesses 
the world but not its image possesses only half the world since 
his soul is poor and has nothing the wealth of the soul exists in 
imagesy he who possesses the image of the world possesses half 
the world even if his humanity is poor and owns nothingy but 
hunger males the soul into a beast that devours the unbearable 
and is poisoned by it my friends it is wise to nourish the soul 
otherwise you will breed dragons and devils in your heart 
 the handwritten draft has dear friends p i the draft has dear friends p i in his lecture at the eth on june   jung noted a point exists at about 
the thirtyfifth year when things begin to change it is the first moment of the shadow side of life of the going down to death it is clear that dante found this point and 
those who have read zarathustra will know that nietzsche also discovered it when this turning point comes people meet it in several ways some turn away from it oth

vol  and  notes on lectures given at the eidgenssiche technische hochschule zarich by prof dr c g jung october july  nd ed zurich privately printed  p 
 
 on october  jung wrote to freud breaking off relations with him and resigning as editor of thejahrbuchfar psychoanalytische und psychopathologische forschungen 
william mcguire ed the freudjung letters tr r mannheim and rfc hull princeton princeton university pressbollingen series  p  
 november   after longing the drift has at the beginning of the following month i seized my pen and began writing this p  
 this affirmation occurs a number of times in jungs later writingssee for example jane pratt notes on a talk given by c g jung is analytical psychology a religion  
springjournal of archetypal psychology andjungian thought  p  
 jung later described his personal transformation at this time as an example of the beginning of the second half of life which frequently marked a return to the soul 
after the goals and ambitions of the first half of life had een achieved symbols oftraniformation  cw  p xxvi see also the turning point oflife  cw  
 jung is referring here to his earlier work for example he had written in  through the associations experiment we are at least given the means to pave the way for 
the experimental research of the mysteries of thesick soul the psychopathological meaning of the associations experiment cw   
 in psychological types  jung noted that in psychology conceptions are a product of the subjective psychological constellation of the researcher cw   this 
reflexivity formed an important theme in his later work see my jung and the making of modem psychology the dream of a science i 
 the drift continues a deaq system that i had contrived assembled from socalled experiences and judgments p  
 in  jung called this process the introversion of the libido on the question of psychological types cw  
i in  jung had written it is a common error to judge longing in terms of the quality of the object  nature is only beautiful on account of the longing and love accorded to it 
by man the aesthetic attributes emanating therefrom apply first and foremost to the libido which alone accounts for the beauty of nature traniformations and symbols 
of the libido cw b  
 in psychological types jung articulated this primacy of the image through his notion of esse in anima cw  ff iiff in her diary notes cary baynes commented 
on this passage what struck me especially was what you said about the bild image being half the world that is the thing that males humanity so dull they 
have missed understanding that thing the world that is the thing that holds them rapt das bild they have never seriously considered unless they have been poets 
february  cfb 
 the drift continues he who strives only for things will sink into poverty as outer wealth increases and his soul will be afflicted by protracted illness p  
 the draft continues this parable about refinding the soul my friends is meant to show you that you have only seen me as half a man since my soul had lost me 
i am certain that you did not notice this because how many are with their souls today yet without the soul there is no path that leads beyond these times p  
in her diary notes cary baynes commented on this passage february th  i came to your conversation with your soul all that you say is said in the right way 
and is sincere it is no cry of the yolug man awakening into life but that of the mature man who has lived fully and richly in ways of the world and yet knows almost 
abruptly one night say that he has missed the essence the vision came at the height of your powel when you could have gone on just as you were with perfect worldly 
success i do not know how you were strong enough to give it heed i am really for everything you say and understand it everyone who has lost the connection with his 
soul or has known how to give it life ought to have a chance to see this book every word so far lives for me and strengthens me just where i feel weak but as you say 
the world is very far away from it in mood today that does not matter too much a book can swing even a whole world if it is written in fire and blood cfb

soul and god 
hi iir 
cap ii 
on the second night i called out to my soul 
i am weary my soul my wandering has lasted too long my 
search for myself outside of myself now i have gone through 
events and find you behind all of them for i made discoveries 
on iny erring through events humanity and the world i found 
men and you my soul i found again first in images within men 
and then you yourself i found you where i least expected you 
you cliinbed out of a dark shaft you announced yourself to me 
in advance in dreamsy they burned in my heart and drove me to 
all the boldest acts of daring and forced me to rise above myself 
you let me see truths of which i had no previous inlding you let 
me undertake journeys whose endless length would have scared 
me if the knowledge of them had not been secure in you 
i wandered for many years so long that i forgot that i 
possessed a soul where were you all this time which beyond 
sheltered you and gave you sanctuary oh that you must speal 
through me that my speech and i are your symbol and expression 
how should i decipher you 
who are you child my dreams have represented you as a 
child and as a maiden i am ignorant of your mystery forgive 
me if i speal as in a dream like a drunkardare you god is god 
a child a maiden forgive me if i babble no one else hears me 
i speak to you quietly and you know that i am neither a drunkard 
nor someone deranged and that my heart twists in pain from the 
wound whose darkness delivers speeches full of mockery you 
are lying to yourself you spoke so as to deceive others and make 
them believe in you you want to be a prophet and chase after 
your ambition the wound still bleeds and i am far from being 
able to pretend that i do not hear the mockery 
how strange it sounds to me to call you a child you who still 
hold the allwithoutend in your hand i went on the way of the 
day and you went invisibly with me putting the pieces together 
meaningfully and letting me see the whole in each part 
you took away where i thought to take hold and you gave me 
where i did not expect anything and time and again you brought 
about fate from new and unexpected quarters where i sowed 
you robbed me of the harvest and where i did not sow you give 
me fruit a hundredfold and time and again i lost the path and soul and god i  
found it again where i would never have foreseen it you upheld 
my belief when i was alone and near despair at every decisive 
moment you let ine believe in myself 
 like a tired wanderer who had sought nothing in the world 
apart from her shall i come closer to my soul i shall learn that 
my soul finally lies behind everything and if i cross the world 
i am ultimately doing this to find my soul even the dearest are 
thelnselves not the goal and end of the lve that goes on seeking 
they are symbols of their own souls 
my friends do you guess to what solitude we ascend 
i must learn that the dregs of my thought my dreains are the 
speech of my soul i must carry them in my heart and go back and 
forth over them in my mind lile the words of the person dearest 
to me dreams are the guiding words of the soul why should i 
henceforth not love my dreams and not make their riddling ilnages 
into objects of my daily consideration you think that the dream is 
foolish and ungainly what is beautiful what is ungainly what 
is clever what is foolish the spirit of this time is your measure 
but the spirit of the depths surpasses it at both ends only the 
spirit of this time knows the difference between large and small 
but this difference is invalid like the spirit which recognizes it  
the spirit of the depths even taught me to consider inyaction 
and my decision as dependent on dreams dreams pave the way 
for life and they determine you without you understanding their 
languagey one would like to learn this language but who can 
teach and learn it scholarliness alone is not enough there is a 
knowledge of the heart that gives deeper insight  the knowledge 
of the heart is in no book and is not to be found in the mouth 
of any teacher but grows out of you like the green seed from the 
dark earth scholarliness belong to the spirit of this time but 
this spirit in no way grasps the dream since the soul is everywhere 
that scholarly knowledge is not 
but how can i attain the knowledge of the heart you can 
attain this knowledge only by living your life to the full you 
live your life fully if you also live what you have never yet lived 
but have left for others to live or to think you will say but i 
cannot live or think everything that others live or thinlc but 
you should say the life that i could still live i should live and 
the thoughts that i could still thinl i should thinl it appears 
as though you want to flee from yourself so as not to have to 
live what remains unlived until now but you cannot flee from 
 in  jung commented on the symbolism of the bird and serpent in connection with the tree the philosophical tree ch  cw  
 november   
 the draft continues which were dark to me and which i sought to grasp in my own inadequate way p  
 the drqft continues i belonged to men and things i did not belong to myself in black book  jung states that he wandered for eleven years p  he had stopped 
writing in this book in  taking it up again in the autumn of  
 blacle book  continues and i found you again only through the soul of the woman p  
 blacle book  continues look i bear a wound that is as yet not healed my ambition to malce an impression p  
 black book  continues i must tell myself most clearly does he use the image of a child that lives in every mans soul were horus tages and christ not children 
dionysus and heracles were also divine children did christ the god of man not call himself the son of man what was his innermost thought in doing so should the 
daughter of man be gods name p  
 the drqft continues how thick the earlier darkness was how impetuous and how egotistic my passion was subjugated by all the daimonsof ambition the desire for 
glory greed uncharitableness and zeal how ignorant i was at the time life tore me away and i deliberately moved away from you and i have done so for all these 
years i recognize how good all of this was but i thought that you were lost even though i sometimes thought that i was lost but you were not lost i went on the way 
of the day you went invisibly with me and guided me step by step putting the pieces together meaningfully pp  
 in  jung endorsed maeders notion of the prospective fimction of the dream an attempt at an account of psychoanalytic theory cw   in a discussion in 
the zurich psychoanalytical society on january  jlmg said the dream is not only the fulfillment of infatltile desires but also symbolizes the future  the dream 
provides the answer through the symbol which one must understand mzs p  on the development of jungs dream theory see my ung and the making of modern 
psychology the dream of a science  
 this echoes blaise pascals famous statement the heart has its reasons of which reason knows nothing yensees  london penguin  p  jungs 
copy of pascals work contains a number of marginal marks 
 in  jung argued that scholarliness was insufficient if one wanted to become a knower of the human soul to do this one had to hang up exact science and put 
away the scholars gown to say farewell to his study and wander with human heart through the world through the horror of prisons mad houses and hospitals through 
drab suburban pubs in brothels and gambling dens through the salons of elegant society the stock exchanges the socialist meetings the churches the revivals and 
ecstasies of the sects to experience love hate and passion in every form in ones body new paths of psychology cw   
 in  jung commented on the pathogenic consequences of the unlived life of parents upon their children what usually has the strongest psychic effect on the child 
is the life which the parents  have not lived this statement would be rather too perfunctory and superficial if we did not add by way of qualification that part of 
their lives which might have been lived had not certain somewhat threadbare excuses prevented the parents from doing so introduction to frances wickes analyse

yourself it is with you all the time and demands fulfillment 
if you pretend to be blind and dumb to this demand you feign 
being blind and deaf to yourself this way you will never reach 
the knowledge of the heart 
the knowledge of your heart is how your heart is 
from a cunning heart you will know cunning 
from a good heart you will know goodness 
so that your understanding becomes perfect consider that your 
heart is both good and evil you ask what should i also live evil 
the spirit of the depths demands the life that you could still 
live you should live wellbeing decides not your wellbeing not 
the wellbeing of the others but only wellbeing 
wellbeing is between me and others in society i too lived
which i had not done before and which i could still do i lived 
into the depths and the depths began to speal the depths taught 
me the other truth it thus united sense and nonsense in me 
i had to recognize that i am only the expression and symbol of 
the soul in the sense of the spirit of the depths i am as i am in 
this visible world a symbol of my soul and i am thoroughly a ser 
completely subjugated utterly obedient the spirit of the depths 
taught me to say i am the servant of a child through this dictum 
i learn above all the most extreme humility as what i most need 
the spirit of this time of course allowed me to believe in my 
reason he let me see myself in the image of a leader with ripe 
thoughts but the spirit of the depths teaches me that i am a 
servant in fact the servant of a child this dictum was repugnant 
to me and i hated it but i had to recognize and accept that my 
soul is a child and that my god in my soul is a child  
if you are boys your god is a woman 
if you are women your god is a boy 
if you are men your god is a maiden 
the god is where you are not 
so it is wise that one has a god this servesfor your peifection 
a maiden is the pregnant future 
a boy is the engenderingfuture 
a woman is having given birth 
a man is having engendered 
so if you are childlike beings now your god will descendfrom the height 
of ripeness to age and death 
but if you are developed beings having engendered or given birth in body 
or in soul so your god rises from the radiant cradle to the incalculable height 
of the future to the maturity and fullness of the coming time 
he who still has his life before him is a child 
he who lives life in the present is developed 
if you thus live all that you can live you are developed 
he who is a child in this time his goldies 
he who is developed in this time his god continues to live the spirit of the depths teaches this mystery 
prosperous and woeful are those whose god is developed 
prosperous and woeful are those whose god is a child 
what is better that man has life ahead of him or that god does 
i know no answer live the unavoidable decides 
the spirit of the depths taught me that my life is encompassed by the divine 
child  from his hand everything unexpected came to me everything living 
this child is what i feel as an eternally springing youth in me  
i n childish men you feel the hopeless transience all that you saw passing 
is yet to come for him his future is full of transience 
but the transience of the things coming toward you has never yet experi 
enced a human meaning 
your continuing to live is a living onward you engender and give birth 
to what is to come you are fecund you live onward 
the childish is unfruitful what is to come to him is what already has been 
engendered and already withered it does not live onward  
my god is a child so wonder not that the spirit of this time in 
me is incensed to mockery and scorn there will be no one who 
will laugh at me as i laughed at myself 
your god should not be a man of mockery rather you yourself 
will be the man of mockery you should mock yourself and rise 
above this if you have still not learned this from the old holy 
books then go there drink the blood and eat the flesh of him who 
was mocked and tormented for the sake of our sins so that you 
totally become his nature deny his beingapartfromyou you 
should be he himsel not christians but christ otherwise you 
will be of no use to the coming god 
is there anyone among you who believes he can be spared the 
way can he swindle his way past the pain of christ i say such 
a one deceives himself to his own detriment he beds down on 
thorns and fire no one can be spared the way of christ since this 
way leads to what is to come you should all become christs 
you do not overcome the old teaching through doing less but 
through doing more every step closer to my soul excites the scornful 
laughter of my devils those cowardlyearwhisperers and poisonmixers 
it was easy for them to laugh since i had to do strange things 
on the service of the soul

n the following night i had to write down all the dreams 
that i could recollect true to their wording the meaning 
of this act was dark to m why all this forgive the fuss that 
rises in me yet you want me to do this what strange things 
are happening to me i know too much not to see on what 
 in the  seminar jtmg explained his thoughts at this time these ideas about the anima and animus led me ever further afield into metaphysical problems and more things 
crept up for reexamination at that time i was on the kantian basis that there were things that could never be solved and that therefore should not be speculated about but 
it seemed to me that if i could find such definite ideas about the anima it was quite worthwhile to try to formulate a conception of god but i could arrive at nothing 
satisfactory and thought for a time that perhaps the anima figure was the deity i said to myself that perhaps men had had a female god originally but growing tired of 
being governed by women they had then overthrown this god i practically threw the whole metaphysical problem into the anima and conceived of it as the dominating 
spirit of psyche in this way i got into a psychological argument with myself about the problem of god analytical psychology p  
 in  jung presented a study of the motif of the divine child in a collaborative volume with the hungarian classicist karl kerenyi see on the psychology of the 
child archetype cw  i jung wrote that the child motif occurs frequently in the individuation process it does not represent ones literal childhood as is emphasized 
by its mythological nature it compensates the onesidedness of consciousness and paves the way for the future development of the personality in certain conditions of 
conflict the unconscious psyche produces a symbol that tmites the opposites the child is such a symbol it anticipates the sel which is produced through the synthesis 
of the conscious and unconscious elements of the personality the typical fates that befall the child indicate the kind of psychic events accompanying the genesis of the 
self the wonderful birth of the child indicates that this happens psychically as opposed to physically 
 in  jtmg wrote an essential aspect of the child motif is its futural character the child is potential future on the psychology of the child archetype cw  i  
 the draft continues my friends as you can see mercy is granted to the developed not the childish i thank my god for this message do not let the teachings of 
christianity deceive you its teachings are good for the most mature minds of bygone time today it serves immature minds christianity no longer promises us grace 
and yet we still need mercy that which i tell you is the way of what is to come my way to mercy p

excessive apprehension brimful of knowledge my foot hesitates 
to follow you into what mist and darkness does your path lead 
must i also learn to do without meaning if this is what you 
demand then so be it this hour belongs to you what is there 
where there is no meaning only nonsense or madness it seems 
to me is there also a supreme meaning is that your meaning 
my soul i limp after you on crutches of understanding i am 
a man and you stride like a god what torture i must return 
to mysel to my smallest things i saw the things of my soul as 
small pitiably small you force me to see them as large to malce 
them large is that your aim i follow but it terrifies me hear 
my doubts otherwise i cannot follow since your meaning is a 
supreme meaning and your steps are the steps of a god 
i understand i must not think either should thought too no 
longer be i should give myself completely into your handsbut 
who are you i do not trust you not once to trust is that my love 
for you my joy in you do i not trust every valiant man and not 
you my soul your hand lies heavy on me but i will i will have 
i not sought to love men and trust them and should i not do this 
with you forget my doubts i know it is ignoble to doubt you 
you know how difficult it is for me to set aside the beggars pride 
i talce in my own thought i forgot that you are also one of my 
friends and have the first right to my trust should what i give 
them not belong to you i recognize my injustice it seems to me 
that i despised you my joy at finding you again was not genuine 
i also recognize that the scornful laughter in me was right 
i must learn to love you should i also set aside selfjudgment 
i am afraid then the soul spoke to me and said this fear 
testifies against me it is true it testifies against you it kills the 
holy trust between you and me 
  how hard is fate if you take a step toward your soul you will at first 
miss the meaning you will believe that you have sunk into meaninglessness 
into eternal disorder you will be right nothing will deliver you yom disorder 
and meaninglessness since this is the other half of the world 
your god is a child so long as you are not childlike is the child order 
meaningi or disorder capricei disorder and meaninglessness are the mother 
of order and meaning order and meaning are things that have become and 
are no longer becoming 
you open the gates of the soul to let the dark ffood of chaos ffow into your 
order and meaning if you marry the ordered to the chaos you produce the 
divine child the supreme meaning beyond meaning and meaninglessness 
you are aftaid to open the doori i too was ayaid since we hadforgotten 
that god is terrible christ taught god is love  but you should know that 
love is also terrible 
i spoke to a loving soul and as i drew nearer to her i was overcome by 
horror and i heaped up a wall of doubt and did not anticipate that i thus 
wanted to protect myself yom my ftaiful soul the desert i  
you dread the depths it should horrify you since the way of what is to 
come leads through it you must endure the temptation of ftar and doubt 
and at the same time acknowledge to the bone that your ftar is justified and 
your doubt is reasonable how otherwise  could it be a true temptation and a 
true overcomingi 
christ totally overcomes the temptation of the devil but not the temptation 
of god to good and reason christ thus succumbs to cursing  
you still have to learn this to succumb to no temptation but to do every 
thing of your own will then you will be free and beyond christianity 
i have had to recognize that i must submit to what i ftar yes even more 
that i must even love what horrifies me we must learn such yom that saint 
who was disgusted by the plague inftctions she drank the pus cif plague boils and 
became aware that it smelled like roses the acts cif the saint were not in vain  
i n everything regarding your salvation and the attainment of mercy you 
are dependent on your soul thus no sacrifice can be too great for you if your 
virtues hinder you yom salvation discard them since they have become evil 
to you the slave to virtue finds the way as little as the slave to vices  
if you believe that you are the master of your soul then become her ser 
vant if you were her servant make yourselfher master since she needs to be 
ruled these should be your first steps 
during six further nights the spirit of the depths was silent in 
me since i swayed between fear defiance and nausea and was 
wholly the prey of my passion i could not and did not want to 
listen to the depths but on the seventh night the spirit of the 
depths spoke to me look into your depths pray to your depths 
waken the dead 
but i stood helpless and did not know what i could do i 
looked into mysel and the only thing i found within was the 
memory of earlier dreams all of which i wrote down without 
knowing what good this would do i wanted to throw everything 
away and return to the light of day but the spirit stopped me and 
forced me back into myself 
the desert

sixth night my soul leads me into the desert into the desert 
of my own self i did not think that my soul is a desert a barren 
hot desert dusty and without drink the journey leads through 
hot sand slowly wading without a visible goal to hope for how 
eerie is this wasteland it seems to me that the way leads so far 
away from mankind i take my way step by step and do not know 
how long my journey will last 
why is my self a desert have i lived too much outside of myself 
in men and events why did i avoid my self was i not dear to 
 in black book  jung noted here here someone stands beside me and whispers terrible things into my ear you write to be printed and circulated among people you want 
to cause a stir through the unusual nietzsche did this better than you you are imitating saint augustine  p  the reference is to augustines confessions  
ce a devotional work written when he was fortyfive years old in which he narrates his conversion to christianity in an autobiographical form corifessions tr h chadwick 
oxford oxford university press  the confessions are addressed to god and recount the years of his wandering from god and the manner of his return echoing this 
in the opening sections of liber n ovus jung addresses his soul and recounts the years of his wandering away from her and the manner of his return in his published works 
jung frequently cited augustine and refeed to his corifessions several times in traniformations and symbols of the libido 
 the first letter of john god is love whoever lives in love lives in god and god in him i john  
 christ was tempted by the devil for forty days in the desert lule  
 matthew   now in the morning as he returned into the city he hungered and when he saw a fig tree in the way he came to it and found nothing thereon 
but leaves only and said unto it let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever and presently the fig tree withered away and when the disciples saw it they marveled 
saying how soon is thefig tree withered away in  jung wrote the christianmy christianknows no curse formulas indeed he does not even sanction the 
cursing of the innocent figtree by the rabbi jesus why i have not adopted the catholic truth cw   
 the draft continues they may serve for your redemption p  
 in thus spoke zarathustra nietzsche wrote md even when one has all the virtues there is still one thing to remember to send even these virtues to sleep at the proper 
time of the chairs of virtue p  in  jung commented on the eastern notion of liberation from virtues and vices commentary to the tibetan book of great

myself but i have avoided the place of my soul i was my thoughts 
after i was no longer events and other men but i was not my 
self confronted with my thoughts i should also rise up above my 
thoughts to my own self my journey goes there and that is why it 
leads away from men and events into solitude is it solitude to be 
with oneself solitude is true only when the self is a desert should 
i also male a garden out of the desert should i people a desolate 
land should i open the airy magic garden of the wilderness what 
leads me into the desert and what am i to do there is it a deception 
that i can no longer trust my thoughts only life is true and only 
life leads me into the desert truly not my thinlcing that would like to 
return to thoughts to men and events since it feels uncanny in the 
desert my soul what am i to do here but my soul spoke to me and 
said wait i heard the cruel word torment belongs to the desert 
through giving my soul all i could give i came to the place of 
the soul and found that this place was a hot desert desolate and 
unfruitful no culture of the mind is enough to make a garden 
out of your soul i had cultivated my spirit the spirit of this time 
in me but not that spirit of the depths that turns to the things 
of the soul the world of the soul the soul has its own peculiar 
world only the self enters in there or the man who has completely 
become his self he who is neither in everits nor in men nor in 
his thoughts through the turning of my desire from things and 
men i turned my self away from things and men but that is 
precisely how i became the secure prey of my thoughts yes i 
wholly became my thoughts 
 i also had to detach myself from my thoughts through turning 
my desire away from them and at once i noticed that my self 
became a desert where only the sun of unquiet desire burned i 
was overwhelmed by the endless infertility of this desert even if 
something could have thrived there the creative power of desire 
was still absent wherever the creative power of desire is there 
springs the soils own seed but do not forget to wait did you not 
see that when your creative force turned to the world how the 
dead things moved under it and through it how they grew and 
prospered and how your thoughts flowed in rich rivers if your 
creative force now turns to the place of the soul you will see how 
your soul becomes green and how its field bears wonderful fruit 
nobody can spare themselves the waiting and most will be 
unable to bear this torment but will throw themselves with greed 
back at men things and thoughts whose slaves they will become 
from then on since then it will have been clearly proved that this 
man is incapable of enduring beyond things men and thoughts 
and they will hence become his master and he will become their 
fool since he cannot be without them not until even his soul 
has become a fruitful field also he whose soul is a garden needs 
things men and thoughts but he is their friend and not their 
slave and fool 
everything to come was already in images to find their soul 
the ancients went into the desert this is an image the ancients 
lived their symbols since the world had not yet become real for 
them thus they went into the solitude of the desert to teach 
us that the place of the soul is a lonely desert there they found the abundance of visions the fruits of the desert the wondrous 
flowers of the soul think diligently about the images that the 
ancients have left behind they show the way of what is to come 
look back at the collapse of empires of growth and death of the 
desert and monasteries they are the images of what is to come 
everything has been foretold but who knows how to interpret it 
when you say that the place of the soul is not then it is not 
but if you say that it is then it is notice what the ancients said 
in images the word is a creative act the ancients said in the 
beginning was the word consider this and think upon it 
the words that oscillate between nonsense and supreme 
meaning are the oldest and truest 
experiences in the desert 
hi iiir  
 after a hard struggle i have come a piece of the way nearer to 
you how hard this struggle was i had fallen into an undergrowth 
of doubt confusion and scorn i recognize that i must be alone 
with my soul i come with empty hands to you my soul what 
do you want to hear but my soul spoke to me and said if you 
come to a friend do you come to tale i knew that this should 
not be so but it seems to me that i am poor and empty i would 
like to sit down near you and at least feel the breath of your 
animating presence my way is hot sand all day long sandy dusty 
paths my patience is sometimes weak and once i despaired of 
myself as you know 
my soul answered and said you speal to me as if you were a 
child complaining to its mother i am not your mother i do not 
want to complain but let me say to you that mine is a long and 
dusty road you are to me like a shady tree in the wilderness i 
would like to enjoy your shade but my soul answered you are 
pleasureseelcing where is your patience your time has not yet 
run its course have you forgotten why you went into the desert 
my faith is weal my face is blind from all that shimmering 
blaze of the desert sun the heat lies on me like lead thirst 
torments me i dare not thinl how unendingly long my way is 
and above all i see nothing in front of me but the soul answered 
you speak as if you have still learned nothing can you not wait 
should everything fall into your lap ripe and finished you are 
full yes you teem with intentions and desirousness do you 
still not know that the way to truth stands open only to those 
without intentions 
i know that everything you say oh my soul is also my thought 
but i hardly live according to it the soul said how tell me do 
you then believe that your thoughts should help you i would 
always like to refer to the fact that i am a human being just a 
human being who is weak and sometimes does not do his best 
but the soul said is this what you think it means to be human 
you are hard my soul but you are right how little we still commit 
ourselves to living we should grow like a tree that likewise 
does not know its law we tie ourselves up with intentions 
not mindful of the fact that intention is the limitation yes the 
 black book  continues i hear the words an anchorite in his own desert the monks in the syrian desert occur to me p 
 black book  continues i think of christianity in the desert physically those ancients went into the desert did they also enter into the desert of their own self or was 
their self not as barren and desolate as mine there they wrestled with the devil i wrestle with waiting it seems to me not less since it is truly a hot hell p  
 around  st anthony went to live as a hermit in the egyptian desert and other hermits followed whom he and pachomius organized into a community this formed 
the basis of christian monasticism which spread to the palestinian and syrian deserts in the fourth century there were thousands of monks in the egyptian desert

 iiir  iii v exclusion of life we believe that we can illuminate the darkness 
with an intention and in that way aim past the light how can 
we presume to want to know in advance from where the light will 
come to us 
let me bring only one complaint before you i suffer from 
scorn my own scorn but my soul said to me do you think 
little of yourself i do not believe so my soul answered then 
listen do you think little of me do you still not know that 
you are not writing a book to feed your vanity but that you 
are speaking with me how can you suffer from scorn if you 
address me with those words that i give you do you know 
then who i am have you grasped me defined me and made 
me into a dead formula have you measured the depths of my 
chasms and explored all the ways down which i am yet going to 
lead you scorn cannot challenge you if you are not vain to the 
marrow of your bones your truth is hard i want to lay down 
my vanity before you since it blinds me see that is why i also 
believed my hands were empty when i came to you today i did 
not consider that it is you who fills empty hands if only they want 
to stretch out yet they do not want to i did not know that i am 
your vessel empty without you but brimming over with you 
 this was my twentyfifth night in the desert this is how 
long it took my soul to awalcen from a shadowy being to her own 
life until she could approach me as a freestanding being sepa
rate from me and i received hard but salutary words from her i 
needed that talcing in hand since i could not overcome the scorn 
within me 
the spirit of this time considers itself extremely clever like every such 
spirit of the time but wisdom is simpleminded not just simple because of 
this the clever person mocks wisdom since mockery is his weapon he uses 
the pointed poisonous weapon because he is struck by naive wisdom if he 
were not struck he would not need the weapon only in the desert do we 
become aware of our terrible simplemindedness but we are aftaid of admitting 
it that is why we are scornful but mockery  does not attain simpleminded 
ness the mockery falls on the mocker and in the desert where no one hears 
and answers he sufficates from his own scorn 
the cleverer you are the more foolish your simplemindedness the totally 
clever are total fools in their simplemindedness we cannot save ourselves 
from the cleverness of the spirit of this time through increasing our cleverness 
but through accepting what our cleverness hates most namely simpleminded 
ness yet we also do not want to be artificial fools because we have fallen 
into simplemindedness rather we will be clever fools that leads to the supreme 
meaning cleverness couples itself with intention simplemindedness knows 
no intention cleverness conquers the world but simplemindedness the soul 
so take on the vow of poverty of spirit in order to partake of the soul  descent into hell in the future i  
against this the scorn of my cleverness rose up many will laugh at my 
foolishness but no one will laugh more than i laughed at myself 
so i overcame scorn but when i had overcome it i was near to my soul 
and she could speak to me and i was soon to see the desert becoming green 
descent into hell 
in the future

iin the following night the air was filled with many voices 
a loud voice called i am falling others cried out confused and 
excited during this where to what do you want should i 
entrust myself to this confusion i shuddered it is a dreadful deep 
do you want me to leave myself to chance to the madness of my 
own darkness wither wither you fall and i want to fall with

i stand in black dirt up to my anldes in a dark cave shadows 
sweep over me i am seized by fear but i know i must go in 
i crawl through a narrow crack in the rock and reach an inner 
cave whose bottom is covered with black water but beyond this i 
catch a glimpse of a luminous red stone which i must reach i wade 
through the muddy water the cave is full of the frightful noise 
of shrieking voices i take the stone it covers a dark opening in the 
rock i hold the stone in my hand peering around inquiringly i do 
not want to listen to the voices they keep me away but i want to 
know here something wants to be uttered i place my ear to the 
opening i hear the flow of underground waters i see the bloody 
head of a man on the dark stream someone wounded someone 
slain floats there i talce in this image for a long time shuddering 
i see a large black scarab floating past on the dark stream 
in the deepest reach of the stream shines a red sun radiating 
through the dark water there i seeand a terror seizes mesmall 
serpents on the dark rock walls striving toward the depths 
where the sun shines a thousand serpents crowd around veiling

 in commentary on the secret of the golden flower i jung criticized the western tendency to turn everything into methods and intentions the cardinal 
lesson as presented by the chinese texts and by meister eckhart was that of allowing psychic events to happen of their own accord letting things happen the action 
through nonaction the letting go of oneself of meister eckhart became the key for me that succeeded in opening the door to the way one must be able to psychically 
let things happen cw i   
 christ preached blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven matthew  in a number of christian communities members talce a vow of poverty 
in i jung wrote just as in christianity the vow of worldly poverty turned the mind away from the riches of this earth so spiritual poverty seeks to renounce the 
false riches of the spirit in order to withdraw not only from the sorry remnantswhich today call themselves the protestant churches of a great past but also from all 
the allurements of exotic aromas in order finally to turn back to itself where in the cold light of consciousness the blank barrenness of the world reaches to the very 
stars on the archetypes of the collective unconscious cw  i  
 the drcift continues this too is an image of the ancients that they lived in things symbolically they renounced wealth in order to have a share of the voluntary poverty 
of their souls therefore i had to grant my soul my most extreme poverty and need and the scorn of my cleverness rose up against this p

heal the wounds that doubt inflicts on me my soul that too 
is to be overcome so that i can recognize your supreme meaning 
how far away everything is and how i have turned back my 
spirit is a spirit of torment it tears asunder my contemplation it 
would dismantle everything and rip it apart i am still a victim of 
my thinking when can i order my thinking to be quiet so that 
my thoughts those unruly hounds will crawl to my feet how 
can i ever hope to hear your voice louder to see your face clearer 
when all my thoughts howl 
i am stunned but i want to be stunned since i have sworn to 
you my soul to trust you even if you lead me through madness 
how shall i ever walk under your sun if i do not drink the bitter 
draught of slumber to the lees help me so that i do not choke 
on my own knowledge the fullness of my knowledge threatens 
to fall in on me my knowledge has a thousand voices an army 
roaring like lions the air trembles when they speak and i am 
their defenseless sacrifice keep it far from me science that clever 
knower that bad prison master who binds the soul and imprisons 
it in a lightless cell but above all protect me from the serpent of 
judgment which only appears to be a healing serpent yet in your 
depths is infernal pison and agonizing death i want to go down 
cleansed into your depths with white garments and not rush in 
like some thie seizing whatever i can and fleeing breathlessly 
let me persist in divine astonishment so that i am ready to 
behold your wonders let me lay my head on a stone before your 
door so that i am prepared to receive your light 
 when the desert begins to bloom it brings forth strange 
plants you will consider yourself mad and in a certain sense you 
will in fact be mad to the extent that the christianity of this 
time lacks madness it lacks divine life tale note of what the 
ancients taught us in images madness is divine but because 
the ancients lived this image concretely in events it became a 
deception for us since we became masters of the reality of the 
world it is unquestionable if you enter into the world of the 
soul you are like a madman and a doctor would consider you to 
be sick what i say here can be seen as sickness but no one can 
see it as sickness more than i do this is how i overcame madness if you do not know what divine 
madness is suspend judgment and wait for the fruits but know 
that there is a divine madness which is nothing other than the 
overpowering of the spirit of this time through the spirit of the 
depths speal then of sick delusion when the spirit of the depths 
can no longer stay down and forces a man to speak in tongues 
instead of in human speech and makes him believe that he 
himself is the spirit of the depths but also speal of sick delusion 
when the spirit of this time does not leave a man and forces him 
to see only the surface to deny the spirit of the depths and to 
take himself for the spirit of the times the spirit of this time is 
ungodly the spirit of the depths is ungodly balance is godly 
because i was caught up in the spirit of this time precisely 
what happened to me on this night had to happen to me namely 
that the spirit of the depths erupted with force and swept away 
the spirit of this time with a powerful wave but the spirit of the 
depths had gained this power because i had spoken to my soul 
during  nights in the desert and i had given her all my love 
and submission but during the  days i gave all my love and 
submission to things to men and to the thoughts of this time 
i went into the desert only at night 
thus can you differentiate sick and divine delusion whoever 
does the one and does without the other you may call sick since 
he is out of balance 
but who can withstand fear when the divine intoxication 
and madness comes to him love soul and god are beautiful 
and terrible the ancients brought over some of the beauty of 
god into this world and this world became so beautiful that it 
appeared to the spirit of the time to be fulfillment and better 
than the bosom of the godhead the frightfulness and cruelty 
of the world lay under wraps and in the depths of our hearts if 
the spirit of the depths seizes you you will feel the cruelty and 
cry out in torment the spirit of the depths is pregnant with ice 
fire and death you are right to fear the spirit of the depths as 
he is full of horror 
you see in these days what the spirit of the depths bore you 
did not believe it but you would have known it if you had taken 
counsel with your fear

guished four types of divine madness i inspired divination such as by the prophetess at delphi  instances in which individuals when ancient sins have given rise 
to troubles have prophesied and incited to prayer and worship  possession by the muses since the technically skilled untouched by the madness of the muses will 
never be a good poet and  the lover in the renaissance the theme of divine madness was talcen up by the neoplatonists such as ecino and by humanists such as 
erasmus erasmuss discussion is particularly important as it fuses the classical platonic conception with christianity for erasmus christianity was the highest type 
of inspired madness like plato erasmus differentiated between two types of madness thus as long as the soul uses its bodily organs aright a man is called sane but 
truly when it bursts its chains and tries to be free practising running away from its prison then one calls it insanity if this happens through disease or a defect of the 
organs then by common consent it is plainly insanity and yet men of this kind too we find foretelling things to come knowing tongues and writings which they 
had never studied beforehandaltogether showing forth something divine in praise of folly tr m a screech london penguin  pp  he adds that if 
insanity happens through divine fervor it may not be the same kind of insanity but it is so like it that most people malce no distinction for lay people the two forms 
of insanity appeared the same the happiness that christians sought was nothing other than a certain kind of madness those who experience this experience some
thing which is very like madness they spealc incoherently and unnaturally utter sound without sense and their faces suddenly change expression  in fact they are 
truly beside themselves ibid pp  in  the philosopher fwj schelling discussed divine madness in a manner that has a certain proximity to jungs discus
sion noting that the ancients did not speak in vain of a divine and holy madness schelling related this to the inner selflaceration of nature he held that nothing 
great can be accomplished without a constant solicitation of madness which should always be overcome but should never be entirely lacking on the one hand there 
were sober spirits in whom there was no trace of madness together with men of understanding who produced cold intellectual works on the other there is one kind of 
person that governs madness and precisely in this overwhelming shows the highest force of the intellect the other kind of person is governed by madness and is some

ered before me in the depths of what is to come lay murder 
the blond hero lay slain the black beetle is the death that is 
necessary for renewal and so thereafter a new sun glowed the 
sun of the depths full of riddles a sun of the night and as the 
rising sun of spring quickens the dead earth so the sun of the 
depths quickened the dead and thus began the terrible struggle 
between light and darkness out of that burst the powerful and 
ever unvanquished source of blood this was what was to come 
which you now experience in your life and it is even more than 
that i had this vision on the night of  december  
depths and surface should mix so that new life can develop 
yet the new life does not develop outside of us but within 
us what happens outside us in these days is the image that the 
peoples live in events to bequeath this image immemorially to 
faroff times so that they might learn from it for their own way just 
as we learned from the images that the ancients had lived before 
us in events 
life does not come from events but from us everything that 
happens outside has already been 
therefore whoever considers the event from outside always sees only that 
it already was and that it is always the same but whoever looks from inside 
knows that everything is new the events that happen are always the same 
but the creative depths of man are not always the same events signify noth
ing they signify only in us we create the meaning of events the meaning is 
and always was artijicial we make it 
because of this we seek in ourselves the meaning of events so that the way 
of  what is to come becomes apparent and our life can pow again 
that which you need comes from yourself namely the meaning of the 
event the meaning of events is not their particular meaning this meaning 
exists in learned books events have no meaning 
the meaning of events is the way of salvation that you create the meaning 
of events comes from the possibility oflife in this world that you create it is 
the mastery of this world and the assertion of your soul in this world 
this meaning of events is the supreme meaning that is not in events 
and not in the soul but is the god standing between events and the soul the 
mediator oflife the way the bridge and the going across  
i would not have been able to see what was to come if i could 
not have seen it in myself 
therefore i talce part in that murder the sun of the depths 
also shines in me after the murder has been accomplished the 
thousand serpents that want to devour the sun are also in me i 
myself am a murderer and murdered sacrificer and sacrificed 
the upwelling blood streams out of me descent into hell in the future i  
you all have a share in the murder in you the reborn one will 
come to be and the sun of the depths will rise and a thousand 
serpents will develop from your dead matter and fallon the sun 
to choke it your blood will stream forth the peoples demonstrate 
this at the present time in unforgettable acts that will be written 
with blood in unforgettable books for eternal memory 
but i ask you when do men fallon their brothers with mighty 
weapons and bloody acts they do such if they do not know that 
their brother is themselves they themselves are sacrificers but 
they mutually do the service of sacrifice they must all sacrifice 
each other since the time has not yet come when man puts the 
bloody knife into himsel in order to sacrifice the one he kills in 
his brother but whom do people kill they kill the noble the 
brave the heroes they take aim at these and do not know that 
with these they mean themselves they should sacrifice the hero 
in themselves and because they do not know this they kill their 
courageous brother 
the time is still not ripe but through this blood sacrifice 
it should ripen so long as it is possible to murder the brother 
instead of onesel the time is not ripe frightful things must happen 
until men grow ripe but anything else will not ripen humanity 
hence all this that talces place in these days must also be so that 
the renewal can come since the source of blood that follows the 
shrouding of the sun is also the source of the new life 
as the fate of the peoples is represented to you in events 
so will it happen in your heart if the hero in you is slain then 
the sun of the depths rises in you glowing from afar and from 
a dreadful place but all the same everything that up till now 
seemed to be dead in you will come to life and will change into 
poisonous serpents that will cover the sun and you will fall into 
night and confusion your blood also will stream from many 
wounds in this frightful struggle your shock and doubt will be 
great but from such torment the new life will be born birth is 
blood and torment your darkness which you did not suspect 
since it was dead will come to life and you will feel the crush of 
total evil and the conflicts of life that still now lie buried in 
the matter of your body but the serpents are dreadful evil 
thoughts and feelings 
you thought you knew that abyss oh you clever people 
it is another thing to experience it everything will happen to 
you think of all the frightful and devilish things that men have 
inflicted on their brothers that should happen to you in your 
heart suffer it yourself through your own hand and know that it 
is your own heinous and devilish hand that inflicts the suffering 
on you but not your brother who wrestles with his own devils 
his nature he announced himself with a loud voice as in a warlike turmoil with the manifold clamoring of the voices of this time the spirit of this time arose in me 
against this stranger and uttered a battle cry together with his many serfs i heard the noise of this battle in the air then the spirit of the depths burst forth and led me 
to the site of the innermost but he had reduced the spirit of this time to a dwarf who was clever and bustling yet was a dwarf and the vision showed me the spirit of 
this time as made of leather that is pressed together sere and lifeless he could not prevent me from entering the dark undenyorld of the spirit of the depths to my 
astonishment i realized that my feet sank into the black muddy water of the river of death the corrected draft adds for that is where death is p  the mystery of 
the shining red crystal was my next destination pp  
 the draft continues my soul is my supreme meaning my image of god neither god himself nor the supreme meaning god becomes apparent in the supreme 
meaning of the human community p  
 in transformation symbolism in the mass  jung commented on the motif of the identity of the sacrificer and the sacrificed with particular reference to the 
visions of zosimos of panapolis a natural philosopher and alchemist of the third century jung noted what i sacrifice is my egotistical claim and by doing this i give 
up myself every sacrifice is therefore to a greater or lesser degree a selfsacrifice cw ii  cf also the katha upanishad ch  verse  jung cited the next two 
verses of the katha upanishad on the nature of the self in  cw   there is a line in the margin of jungs copy by these verses in the sacred books of the east 
vol xv pt  p ii in dreams jung noted in connection with a dream my intensive unconscious relation to india in the red book p  
 jung elaborated the theme of collective guilt in fter the catastrophe  cw ro 
 the reference is to the events of world war  the autumn of  when jung wrote this section of layer two saw the battle of the marne and the first battle of ypres 
 in his lecture at the eth on june   jung commented partially in reference to this fantasy which he referred to anonymously the sun motif appears in many 
places and times and the meaning is always the samethat a new consciousness has been born it is the light of illumination which is projected into space this is a 
psychological event the medical term hallucination makes no sense in psychology  the katabasis plays a very important role in the middle ages and the old masters 
conceived of the rising sun in this katabasis as of a new light the lux moderna the jewel the lapis modern psychology p  
 the draft continues my friends i know that i speak in riddles but the spirit of the depths has granted me a view of many things in order to help my weak comprehension 
i want to tell you more about my visions so that you better understand which things the spirit of the depths would like you to see may those be well who can see these 
things those who cannot must live them as blind fate in images p

i would like you to see what the murdered hero means 
those nameless men who in our day have murdered a prince 
are blind prophets who demonstrate in events what then is valid 
only for the soul through the murder of princes we will learn 
that the prince in us the hero is threatened whether this 
should be seen as a good or a bad sign need not concern us what 
is awful today is good in a hundred years and in two hundred 
years is bad again but we must recognize what is happening 
there are nameless ones in you who threaten your prince the 
heredi tary ruler 
but our ruler is the spirit of this time which rules and 
leads in us all it is the general spirit in which we think and act 
today he is of frightful power since he has brought immeasur
able good to this world and fascinated men with unbelievable 
pleasure he is bejewelled with the most beautiful heroic virtue 
and wants to drive men up to the brightest solar heights in 
everlasting ascentioo 
the hero wants to open up everything he can but the 
nameless spirit of the depths evokes everything that man cannot 
incapacity prevents further ascent greater height requires greater 
virtue we do not possess it we must first create it by learning to 
live with our incapacity we must give it life for how else shall it 
develop into ability 
we cannot slay our incapacity and rise above it but that 
is precisely what we wanted incapacity will overcome us and 
demand its share of life our ability will desert us and we will 
believe in the sense of the spirit of this time that it is a loss 
yet it is no loss but a gain not for outer trappings however but 
for inner capability 
the one who learns to live with his incapacity has learned a 
great deal this will lead us to the valuation of the smallest things 
and to wise limitation which the greater height demands if all 
heroism is erased we fall back into the misery of humanity and 
into evert worse our foundations will be caught up in excitement 
since our highest tension which concerns what lies outside us 
will stir them up we yill fall into the cesspool of our underworld 
among the rubble of all the centuries in usioi 
the heroic in you is the fact that you are ruled by the 
thought that this or that is good that this or that performance 
is indispensable this or that cause is objectionable this or that 
goal must be attained in headlong striving work this or that 
pleasure should be ruthlessly repressed at all costs consequently 
you sin against incapacity but incapacity exists no one should 
deny it find fault with it or shout it downi splitting of the spirit

but on the fourth night i cried to journey to hell means to 
become hell oneselfi it is all frightfully muddled and interwoven 
on this desert path there is not just glowing sand but also horrible 
tangled invisible beings who live in the desert i didnt lmow this 
the way is only apparently clear the desert is only apparently 
empty it seems inhabited by magical beings who murderously 
attach themselves to me and daimonically change my form i have 
evidently taken on a completely monstrous fonn in which i can no 
longer recognize myself it seems to me that i have become a 
monstrous animal form for which i have exchanged my humanity 
this way is surrounded by hellish magic invisible nooses have 
been thrown over me and ensnare nle 
but the spirit of the depths approached me and said clilnb 
down into your depths sink 
but i was indignant at him and said how can i sink i am 
unable to do this myself 
then the spirit spoke words to me that appeared ridiculous 
and he said sit yourself down be calm 
but i cried out indignantly how frightful it sounds like 
nonsense do you also demand this of me you overthrew the mighty 
gods who mean the most to us my soul where are you have i 
entrusted myself to a stupid animal do i stagger like a drunkard 
to the grave do i stalnmer stupidities like a lunatic is this your 
way my soul the blood boils in me and i would strangle you if i 
could seize you you weave the thickest darlmesses and i aln like 
a madman caught in your net but i yearn teach me 
but my soul spoke to me saying my path is light 
yet i indignantly answered do you call light what we men 
call the worst darkness do you call day night 
to this my soul spoke a word that roused my anger my light 
is not of this world 
i cried i lmow of no other world 
the soul answered should it not exist because you lmow 
nothing of it i but our lmowledge does our knowledge also 
not hold good for you what is it going to be if not lmowledge 
where is security where is solid ground where is light your 
darlmess is not only darker than night but bottomless as well if 
its not going to be knowledge then perhaps it will do without

 in the relations between the i and the unconscious  jung refers to the destructive and anarchic aspects that are constellated in societies being enacted by prophetically 
inclined individuals though spectacular crimes such as regicide cw   
 political assassinations were frequent at the beginning of the twentieth century the particular event referred to here is the assassination of archduke franz ferdinand

twentieth century a history cifthe twentieth century volume one  london william morrow  p

aspiration in me as our time understands it p   
ioi the drift continues everything that we have forgotten will be revived each human and divine passion the black serpents and the reddish sun of the depths p  
i on june   there was a discussion on the psychology of the world war in the association for analytical psychology following a presentation by jules vodoz on the 
songcifroland jung argued that hypothetically the world war can be raised to the subjective level in detail the authoritarian principle tiling action on the basis of 
principles clashes with the emotional principle the collective unconscious enters into allegiance with the emotional concerning the hero he said the herothe 
beloved figure of the people should fall all heroes bring themselves down by carrying the heroic attitude beyond a certain limit and hence lose their footing map

i forgive me perhaps im hard of hearing perhaps i 
misinterpret you perhaps i ensnare myself in selfdeceit and 
monkey business and i am a rascal grinning at myself in a mirror a 
fool in my own madhouse perhaps you stumble over my folly 
my soul you delude yourself you do not deceive me your 
words are lies to you not me

my soul who gives you thoughts and words do you malce 
them are you not my serf a recipient who lies at my door and 
picks up my alms and you dare think that what you devise and 
spealc could be nonsense dont you know yet that it comes from 
me and belongs to me 
so i cried full of anger but then my indignation must also 
come from you and in me you are indignant against yourself my 
soul then spoke the ambiguous words that is civil war 
i was afflicted with pain and rage and i answered back 
how painful my soul to hear you use hollow words i feel sick 
comedy and drivelbut i yearn i can also crawl through mud 
and the most despised banality i can also eat dust that is part 
of hell i do not yield i am defiant you can go on devising

theatrical spectacles come close i am ready ready my soul you 
who are a devil to wrestle with you too you donned the mask of 
a god and i worshiped you now you wear the mask of a devil a 
frightful one the mask of the banal of eternal mediocrity only 
one favor give me a moment to step back and consider is the 
struggle with this mask worthwhile was the mask of god worth 
worshiping i cannot do it the lust for battle burns in my limbs 
no i cannot leave the battlefield defeated i want to seize you crush 
you monkey buffoon woe if the struggle is unequal my hands 
grab at air but your blows are also air and i perceive trickery 
i find myself again on the desert path it was a desert vision a 
vision of the solitary who has wandered down long roads there 
lurk invisible robbers and assassins and shooters of poison darts 
suppose the murderous arrow is sticking in my heart 
 as the first vision had predicted to me the assassin appeared 
from the depths and came to me just as in the fate of the peoples 
of this time a nameless one appeared and leveled the murder 
weapon at the prince los 
 black book  continues are you neurotic are we neurotic p  
 see note  p  murder of the hero i  
i felt myself transformed into a rapacious beast my heart 
glowered in rage against the high and beloved against my prince 
and hero just as the nameless one of the people driven by greed 
for murder lunged at his dear prince because i carried the 
murder in me i foresaw it 
because i carried the war in me i foresaw it i felt betrayed and 
lied to by my king why did i feel this way he was not as i had 
wished him to be he was other than i expected he should be the 
king in my sense not in his sense he should be what i called ideal 
my soul appeared to me hollow tasteless and meaningless but in 
reality what i thought of her was valid for my ideal 
it was a  vision of the desert i struggled with mirror images 
of myself it was civil war in me i myself was the murderer and 
the murdered the deadly arrow was stuck in my heart and i did 
not know what it meant my thoughts were murder and the fear 
of death which spread like poison everywhere in my body 
and thus was the fate of the people the murder of one was 
the poisonous arrow that flew into the hearts of men and 
kindled the fiercest war this murder is the indignation of 
incapacity against will a judas betrayal that one would like 
someone else to have committed we are still seeking the goat 
that should bear our sin 
everything that becomes too old becomes evil the same is true oj your 
highest learn from the suffering oj the crucified god that one can also betray 
and crucify a god namely the god of the old year if a god ceases being the 
way ojlije he must fall secretly

on the following night however i had a visioni i was with 
a youth in high mountains it was before daybreak the eastern 
sky was already light then siegfrieds horn resounded over the 
mountains with a jubilant sound  we knew that our mortal 
enemy was coming we were armed and lurked beside a narrow 
rocky path to murder him then we saw him coming high across 
the mountains on a chariot made of the bones of the dead he 
drove boldly and magnificently over the steep rocks and arrived at 
the narrow path where we waited in hiding as he came around 
 the drqft continues my friends if you knew what depths of the future you carry inside you those who look into their own depths look at what is to come p  
 the drqft continues but just as judas is a necessary link in the chain of the work of redemption so is our judas betrayal of the hero also a necessary passageway to 
redemption p  in traniformations and symbols ojthe libido  jung discussed the view of the abbe oegger in anatole frances story lejardin depicure who 
maintained that god had chosen judas as an instrument to complete christs work of redemption cw b  
 cf leviticus  and he shall take the two goats and present them before the lord at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation and aaron shall cast lots 
upon the two goats one lot for the lord and the other lot for the scapegoat and aaron shall bring the goat upon which the lords lot fell and offer him for a sin 
offering but the goat on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat shall be presented alive before the lord to make an atonement with him and to let him go for a scape
goat into the wilderness 
 the drqft continues this is what the ancients taught us p  
iio the drqft continues those who wander in the desert experience everything that belongs to the desert the ancients have described this to us from them we can learn 
open the ancient books and learn what will come to you in solitude everything will be given to you and you will be spared nothing the mercy and the torment p

the turn ahead of us we fired at the same time and he fell slain 
thereupon i turned to flee and a terrible rain swept down 
but after thisii i went through a torment unto death and i felt 
certain that i must kill mysel if i could not solve the riddle of 
the murder of the hero lis 
then the spirit of the depths came to me and spoke these words 
the highest truth is one and the same with the absurd this 
statement saved me and like rain after a long hot spell it swept 
away everything in me which was too highly tensed 
then i had a second visionii i saw a merry garden in which 
forms walked clad in white silk all covered in colored light some 
reddish the others blueish and greenishii image ivv 
i know i have stridden across the depths through guilt i have 
become a newborn ilb 
 we also  live in our dreams we do not live only by day 
sometimes we accomplish our greatest deeds in dreams il 
in that night my life was threatened since i had to kill my lord 
and god not in single combat since who among mortals could 
kill a god in a duel you can reach your god only as an assassinio 
if you want to overcome him 
but this is the bitterest for mortal men our gods want to be 
overcome since they require renewal if men kill their princes 
they do so because they cannot kill their gods and because they 
do not know that they should kill their gods in themselves 
if the god grows old he becomes shadow nonsense and he goes down the 
greatest truth becomes the greatest lie the brightest day becomes darkest night 
as day requires night and night requires day so meaning requires absurdity 
and absurdity requires meaning 
day does not exist through itself night does not exist through itself 
the reality that exists through itself is day and night 
so the reality is meaning and absurdity 
noon is a moment midnight is a moment morning comes from night 
evening turns into night but evening comes from the day and morning turns 
into day 
so meaning is a moment and a transition from absurdity to 
absurdity and absurdity only a moment and a transition from 
meaning to meaning  oh that siegfried blond and blueeyed the german hero 
had to fall by my hand the most loyal and courageous he had 
everything in himself that i treasured as the greater and more 
beautiful he was my power my boldness my pride i would have 
gone under in the same battle and so only assassination was 
left to me if i wanted to go on living it could only be through 
trickery and cunning 
judge not think of the blond savage of the german forests 
who had to betray the hammerbrandishing thunder to the pale 
neareastern god who was nailed to the wood like a chicken 
marten the courageous were overcome by a certain contempt 
for themselves but their life force bade them to go on living 
and they betrayed their beautiful wild gods their holy trees 
and their awe of the german forests 
what does siegfried mean for the germans what does it 
tell us that the germans suffer siegfrieds death that is why 
i almost preferred to kill myself in order to spare him but i 
wanted to go on living with a new god 
after death on the cross christ went into the underworld 
and became hell so he took on the form of the antichrist the 
dragon the image of the antichrist which has come down to 
us from the ancients announces the new god whose coming 
the ancients had foreseen 
gods are unavoidable the more you flee from the god the 
more surely you fall into his hand 
the rain is the great stream of tears that will come over the 
peoples the tearful flood of released tension after the constriction 
of death had encumbered the peoples with horrific force it 
is the mourning of the dead in me which precedes burial and 
rebirth the rain is the fructifying of the earth it begets the

ii in black book  jung noted i strode lightfootedly up an incredibly steep path and later helped my wife who followed me at a slower pace to ascend some people 
mocked us but i didnt mind since this showed that they didnt know that i had murdered the hero p  jung recounted this dream in the  seminar stress
ing different details he preceded it with the following remarks siegfried was not an especially sympathetic figure to me and i dont know why my unconscious got 
engrossed in him wagners siegfried especially is exaggeratedly extraverted and at times actually ridiculous i never liked him nevertheless the dream showed him to 
be my hero i could not understand the strong emotion i had with the dream after narrating the dream jung concluded i felt an enormous pity for him siegfried 
as though i myself had been shot i must then have had a hero i did not appreciate and it was my ideal of force and efficiency i had killed i had killed my intellect 
helped on to the deed by a personification of the collective unconscious the little brown man with me in other words i deposed my superior function  the rain 
that fell is a symbol of the release of tension that is theforces of the unconscious are loosed when this happens the feeling of relief is engendered the crime is 
expiated because as soon as the main function is deposed there is a chance for other sides of the personality to be born into life analytical psychology pp  in 
black book  and in his later remarks about this dream in memories p  jung said that he felt that he would have to kill himself if he could not solve this riddle 
ii the draft continues and i fell asleep again a second dream vision rose in me pp  
ii the draft continues these lights pervaded my mind and senses and once again i fell asleep like a convalescent p  jung recounted this dream to aniela jaffe 
and commented that after he had been confronted with the shadow as in the siegfried dream this dream expressed the idea that he was one thing and something else 
at the same time the unconscious reached beyond one like a saints halo the shadow was like the lightcolored sphere that surrounded the people he thought this 
was a vision of the beyond where men are complete mp p  
ii the draft continues the world inbetween is a world of the simplest things it is not a world of intention and imperatives but a perchanceworld with indefinite 
possibilities here the next ways are all small no broad straight highroads no heaven above them no hell beneath p  in october of  jung gave some talles to 
the psychological club adaptation individuation and collectivity in which he commented on the importance of guilt the first step in individuation is tragic guilt 
the accumulation of guilt demands expiation cw is i

 the draft continues a judas p  
 the draft continues my dream vision showed me that i was not alone when i committed the deed i was helped by a youth that is one who was younger than me 
a rejuvenated version of myself p  
 the draft continues siegfried had to die just like wotan p  in  jung wrote of the effects of the introduction of christianity into germany christianity 
split the germanic barbarian into his upper and lower halves and enabled him by repressing the dark side to domesticate the brighter half and fit it for culture but 
the lower darker half still awaits redemption and a second domestication until then it will remain associated with vestiges of prehistory with the collective uncon
scious which must indicate a peculiar and increasing activation of the collective unconscious on the unconscious cw io  he expanded on this situation in 
wotan  cw io 
 in the draft this sentence reads we want to continue living with a new god a hero beyond christ p  to aniela jaffe he recounted that he had thought of 
himself as an overcoming hero but the dream indicated that the hero had to be killed this exaggeration of the will was represented by the germans at that time such 
as by the siegfried line a voice within him said if you do not understand the dream you must shoot yourself mp p s memories p  the original siegfried 
line was a defensive line established by the germans in northern france in  this was actually a subsection of the hindenburg line

of your glory in tongues that are atrocious to them 
you will come over them in the hour of their disgrace and will become 
known to them in what they hate foar and abhor  
your voice the rarest pleasing sound will be heard amid the stammerings 
of wretches rejects and those condemned as worthless 
your realm will be touched by the hands of those who also worshiped 
before the most profound lowliness and whose longing drove them through 
the mud tide of evil 
you will give your gifts to those who pray to you in terror and doubt and 
your light will shine upon those whose knees must bend before you unwillingly 
and who are filled with resentment 
your life is with he who has overcome himself i ob vcr and who has 
disowned his selfovercoming

believe in the highest and faithlessly betray themselves for thirty pieces 
of silver  
those who will dirty their pure hands and cheat on their best knowledge 
against error and take their virtues from a murderers grave are invited to 
your great banquet

testimony that you are a veritable god the conception of the god i

my vision and let me become aware of the birth of the new god

if the god is absolute beauty and goodness how should he 
encompass the fllness of life which is beautiful and hateful 
good and evil laughable and serious human and inhuman 
how can man live in the womb of the god if the godhead 
himself attends only to onehalf of him 
if we have risen near the heights of good and evil then our 
badness and hatefulness lie in the most extreme torment mans 
torment is so great and the air of the heights so wealc that he can 
hardly live anymore the good and the beautiful freeze to the 
ice of the absolute idea and the bad and hateful become mud 
puddles full of crazy life 
therefore after his death christ had to journey to hell 
otherwise the ascent to heaven would have become impos
sible for him christ first had to become his antichrist his 
underworldly brother 
no one knows what happened during the three days christ 
was in hell i have experienced it the men of yore said that he 
had preached there to the deceased what they say is true but 
do you know how this happened 
it was folly and monkey business an atrocious hells 
masquerade of the holiest mysteries how else could christ have 
saved his antichrist read the unknown books of the ancients 
and you will learn much from them notice that christ did not 
remain in hell but rose to the heights in the beyond 
our conviction of the value of the good and beautiful has 
become strong and unshakable that is why life can extend 
beyond this and still fulfil everything that lay bound and yearning 
but the bound and yearning is also thehateful and bad are you 
again indignant about the hateful and the bad 
through this you can recognize hw great are their force 
and value for life do you think that it is dead in you but 
this dead can also change into serpents these serpents will 
extinguish the prince of your days 
i a reference to christs parable of the mustard seed matthew  the kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed which a man took and sowed in his 
field which indeed is the least of all seeds but when it is grown it is the greatest among herbs and becometh a tree cf luke  mark  
i in mark  christ stated that those who believe shall speak with new tongues the issue of speaking in tongues is discussed in i corinthians  and is central in the 
pentecostal movement 
i the theme of selfovercoming is an important one in the work of nietzsche in thus spoke zarathustra nietzsche writes i teach you the superman man is something 
that should be overcome what have you done to overcome him all creatures hitherto have created something beyond themselves and do you want to be the ebb 
reat tide and return to the animals rather than overcome man zarathustras prologue  p  underlined as in jungs copy for jungs discussion of this 
theme in nietzsche see nietzsches zarathustra notes of the seminar given in  vol  ed james jarrett princeton princeton university press  pp  
i judas betrayed christ for thirty pieces of silver matthew  
i see note  p  
i this conception of the encompassing nature of the new god is fully developed further ahead in scrutinies sermon  p f 
ii the theme of the integration of evil into the godhead played an important role in jungs works see aion  cw   ch  and answer toob  cw ii 
i the conception of the absolute idea was developed by hegel he understood it as the culmination and the selfdifferentiating unity of the dialectical sequence that 
gives rise to the cosmos cf hegels logic tr w wallace london thames and hudson  jung refers to this in  in psychological types cw   
i this sentence is cut in the corrected drift and replaced with but this can be guessed p  
i i peter  states for this reason the gospel was preached also to those who are dead that they might be judged according to men in the flesh but live according to 
god in the spirit 
i the theme of christs descent into hell features in several apocryphal gospels in the apostles creed it is stated that he descended into hell the third day he 
arose again from the dead jung commented on the appearance of this motif in medieval alchemy psychology and alchemy  cw  n   mysterium 
coniunctionis  cw  one of the sources which jung referred to cw  n was albrecht dieterichs nekyia beitriige zur erkliirung der teuentdeckten 
petrusapokalypse which commented on an apocalyptic fragment from the gospel of st peter in which christ gives a detailed description of hell jungs copy of this 
work has numerous markings in the margins and in the rear are two additional pieces of paper with a list of page references and remarks in  he gave the following 
psychological interpretation of the motif of christs descent into hell the scope of the integration is suggested by the descensus ad infernos the descent of christs 
soul to hell whose work of redemption also encompasses the dead the psychological equivalent of this forms the integration of the collective unconscious which 
represents an essential part of the individuation process aion cw   in  he noted the three days descent into hell during death describes the sinking 
of the vanished value into the unconscious where by conquering the power of darkness it establishes a new order and then rises up to heaven again that is attains 
supreme clarity of consciousness psychology and religion cw ii  the unknown books of the ancients refer to the apocryphal gospels 
i the drift continues but the serpent is also life in the image furnished by the ancients the serpent put an end to the childlike magnificence of paradise they even 
said that christ himself had been a serpent p  jung commented on this motif in  in aion cw   i

 do you see what beauty and joy came over men when the depths 
unleashed this greatest war and yet it was a frightful beginning 
if we do not have the depths how do we have the heights 
yet you fear the depths and do not want to confess that you are 
afraid of them it is good though that you fear yourselves say 
it out loud that you are afraid of yourselves it is wisdom to fear 
oneself only the heroes say that they are fearless but you know 
what happens to the hero 
with fear and trembling looking around yourselves with 
mistrust go thus into the depths but do not do this alone two 
or more is greater security since the depths are full of murder also 
secure yourselves the way of retreat go cautiously as if you were 
cowards so that you preempt the soul murderers the depths 
would like to devour you whole and choke you in mud 
he who journeys to hell also becomes hell therefore do not 
forget from whence you come the depths are stronger than us 
so do not be heroes be clever and drop the heroics since nothing is 
more dangerous than to play the hero the depths want to keep 
you they have not returned very many up to now and therefore 
men fled from the depths and attacked them 
what if the depths due to the assault now change themselves 
into death but the depths indeed have changed themselves 
into death therefore when they awoke they inflicted a thousand
fold death we cannot slay death as we have already taken all 
life from it if we still want to overcome death then we must 
enliven it 
therefore on your journey be sure to take golden cups full of the 
sweet drink of life red wine and give it to dead matter so that it can 
win life back the dead matter will change into black serpents 
do not be frightened the serpents will immediately put out the 
sun of your days and a night with wonderful willothewisps 
will come over you 
take pains to waken the dead dig deep mines and throw in 
sacrificial gifts so that they reach the dead reflect in good heart 
upon evil this is the way to the ascent but before the ascent 
everything is night and hell 
 what do you think of the essence of hell hell is when the 
depths come to you with all that you no longer are or are not yet 
capable of hell is when you can no longer attain what you could 
attain hell is when you must thinlc and feel and do everything 
that you know you do not want hell is when you know that your 
having to is also a wanting to and that you yourself are responsible 
for it hell is when you know that everything serious that you 
have planned with yourself is also laughable that everything fine is also brutal that everything good is also bad that everything 
high is also low and that everything pleasant is also shameful 
but the deepest hell is when you realize that hell is also no 
hell but a cheerful heaven not a heaven in itself but in this 
respect a heaven and in that respect a hell 
that is the ambiguity of the god he is born from a dark 
ambiguity and rises to a bright ambiguity unequivocalness is 
simplicity and leads to death but ambiguity is the way of life  
if the left foot does not move then the right one does and you 
move the god wills this 
you say the christian god is unequivocal he is vel but 
what is more ambiguous than love love is the way of life but 
your love is only on the way of life if you have a left and a right 
nothing is easier than to play at ambiguity and nothing is 
more difficult than living ambiguity he who plays is a child his 
god is old and dies he who lives is awakened his god is young 
and goes on he who plays hides from the inner death he who 
lives feels the going onward and immortality so leave the play 
to the players let fall what wants to fall if you stop it it will 
sweep you away there is a true love that does not concern itself 
with neighbors 
when the hero was slain and the meaning recognized in 
the absurdity when all tension came rushing down from gravid 
clouds when everything had become cowardly and looked to its 
own rescue i became aware of the birth of the god opposing 
me the god sank into my heart when i was confused by mockery 
and worship by grief and laughter by yes and no 
the one arose from the melting together of the two he was 
born as a child from my own human soul which had conceived him 
with resistance like a virgin thus it corresponds to the image that 
the ancients have given to us but when the mother my soul was 
pregnant with the god i did not know it it even seemed to me as 
if my soul herself was the god although he lived only in her body 
and thus the image of the ancients is fulfilled i pursued my 
soul to kill the child in it for i am also the worst enemy of my 
god but i also recognized that my enmity is decided upon in 
the god he is mockery and hate and anger since this is also a 
way of life 
i must say that the god could not come into being before the 
hero had been slain the hero as we understand him has become an 
enemy of the god since the hero is perfection the gods envy the 
perfection of man because perfection has no need of the gods but 
since no one is perfect we need the gods the gods love perfection 
because it is the total way of life but the gods are not with him 
 the corrected drqft has a beginning of hell p  in  jung recalled at the outbreak of war i was in inverness and i returned through holland and germany 
i came right through the armies going west and i had the feeling that it was what one would call in german a hochzeitsstimmung a feast oflove allover the country 
everything was decorated with flowers it was an outburst of love they all loved each other and everything was beautiful yes the war was important a big affair but 
the main thing was the brotherly love allover the country everybody was everybody elses brother one could have everything anyone possessed it did not matter the 
peasants threw open their cellars and handed out what they had that happened even in the restaurant and buffet at the railroad station i was very hungry i had had 
nothing to eat for about twentyfour hours and they had some sandwiches left and when i asked what they cost they said oh nothing just take them and when i 
first crossed the border into germany we were led into an enormous tent full of beer and sausages and bread and cheese and we paid nothing it was one great feast of 
love i was absolutely bewildered visions seminars  ed claire douglas princeton princeton university press  pp  
 the phrase soul murderer had been used by luther and zwingli and more recently by daniel paul schreber in his  memoirs of my nervous illness eds and tr ida 
macalpine and richard hunter folkestone william dawson  jung discussed this work in  in on the psychology of dementia praecox cw  and drew 
freuds attention to it in discussions concerning schreber in the association for analytical psychology on july  and  of  following presentations by schneiter 
jlmg drew attention to gnostic parallels to schrebers imagery map vol i p f 
 the reference is to the carnage of world war  
 this refers back to the vision in chapter  descent into hell in the future in  jung wrote the threat to ones inmost self from dragons and serpents points to the 
danger of the newly acquired consciousness being swallowed up again by the instinctive soul tlle unconscious on the psychology of the child archetype cw   
 the corrected draft has instead to an end p 
 in  jung wrote to zwi werblowsky concerning the intentional ambiguity of his writings the language i speak must be equivocal that is ambiguous to do justice 
to psychic nature with its double aspect i strive consciously and deliberately for ambiguous expressions because it is superior to unequivocalness and corresponds to 
the nature of being letters  pp  
 the drqft continues look at the images of the gods that the ancients and the men of old left behind their nature is ambiguous and equivocal p  
 i john  god is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in god and god in him 
 the drqft continues whoever reverses this word and others that i speak is a player since he doesnt respect the spoken word know that you attain yourself from 
what you read in a book you read as much into a book as out of it p  
 the corrected drqft has birthofthenew conception of a god p

who wishes to be perfect because he is an imitation of perfectionlso 
imitation was a way of life when men still needed the heroic 
prototype lsi the monkeys manner is a way of life for monkeys 
and for man as long as he is like a monkey human apishness has 
lasted a terribly long time but the time will come when a piece of 
that apishness will fall away from men 
that will be a time of salvation and the dove and the eternal 
fire and redemption will descend 
then there will no longer be a hero and no one who can 
imitate him because from that time henceforth all imitation 
is cursed the new god laughs at imitation and discipleship he 
needs no imitators and no pupils he forces men through himself 
the god is his own follower in man he imitates himself 
we think that there is singleness within us and communality 
outside us outside of us is the communal in relation to the 
external while singleness refers to us we are single if we are in 
ourselves but communal in relation to what is outside us but 
if we are outside of ourselves then we are single and selfish in the 
communal our self suffers privation if we are outside ourselves 
and thus it satisfies its needs with communality consequently 
communality is distorted into singleness if we are in ourselves we 
fulfil the need of the sel we prosper and through this we become 
aware of the needs of the communal and can fulfil themls 
if we set a god outside of ourselves he tears us loose from the 
sel since the god is more powerful than we are our self falls 
into privation but if the god moves into the sel he snatches us 
from what is outside usis we arrive at singleness in ourselves so 
the god becomes communal in reference to what is outside us 
but single in relation to us no one has my god but my god has 
everyone including myself the gods of all individual men always 
have all other men including myself so it is always only the one 
god despite his multiplicity you arrive at him in yourself and only 
through your self seizing you it seizes you in the advancement 
of your life 
the hero must fall for the sake of our redemption since he is 
the model and demands imitation but the measure of imitation 
is fulfiledls we should become reconciled to solitude in ourselves 
and to the god outside of us if we enter into this solitude then 
the life of the god begins if we are in ourselves then the space 
around us is free but filled by the god 
our relations to men go through this empty space and also 
through the god but earlier it went through selfishness since we 
were outside ourselves therefore the spirit foretold to me that the 
cold of outer space will spread across the earthlss with this he 
showed me in an image that the god will step between men and 
drive every individual with the whip of icy cold to the warmth of his 
own monastic hearth because people were beside themselves 
going into raptures like madmen mysterium encounter i  
selfish desire ultimately desires itself you find yourself in your 
desire so do not say that desire is vain if you desire yoursel you 
produce the divine son in your embrace with yourself your desire 
is the father of the god your self is the mother of the god but 
the son is the new god your master 
if you embrace your sel then it will appear to you as if the 
world has become cold and empty the colning god moves into 
this emptiness 
if you are in your solitude and all the space around you has 
become cold and unending then you have moved far from men 
and at the same time you have come near to them as never before 
selfish desire only apparently led you to men but in reality it led 
you away from them and in the end to yoursel which to you and 
to others was the most remote but now if you are in solitude 
your god leads you to the god of others and through that to the 
true neighbor to the neighbor of the self in others 
if you are in yoursel you become aware of your incapacity 
you will see how little capable you are of imitating the heroes and 
of being a hero yourself so you will also no longer force others to 
become heroes like you they suffer from incapacity incapacity 
too wants to live but it will overthrow your gods b p v  i

on the night when i considered the essence of the god i 
became aware of an image i lay in a dark depth an old man 
stood before me he looked like one of the old prophetsls a 
black serpent lay at his feet some distance away i saw a house 
with columns a beautiful maiden steps out of the door she 
walks uncertainly and i see that she is blind the old man waves 
to me and i follow him to the house at the foot of the sheer wall 
of rock the serpent creeps behind us darkness reigns inside 
the house we are in a high hall with glittering walls a bright 
stone the color of water lies in the background as i look into its 
reflection the images of eve the tree and the serpent appear to 
me after this i catch sight of odysseus and his journey on the 
high seas suddenly a door opens on the right onto a garden full 
of bright sunshine we step outside and the old man says to me 
do you know where you are 
i i am a stranger here and everything seems strange to me 
anxious as in a dream who are you 
e i am elijahls and this is my daughter salomei s 
i the daughter of herod the bloodthirsty woman 
iso the importance of wholeness above perfection is an important theme in jungs later work cf aion  cw    mysterium coniunctionis  cw   
lsi in  jung wrote man has one ability which though it is of the greatest utility for collective purposes is the most pernicious for individuation and that is imitation 
collective psychology can hardly dispense with imitation the structure of the unconscious cw   in on the psychology of the child archetype  jung wrote 
about the danger of identifying with the hero this identity is often very extremely stubborn and dangerous for the equilibrium of the soul if the identity can be 
dissolved the figure of the hero through the reduction of consciousness to a human level can gradually be differentiated into a symbol of the self cw  i  
is jung dealt with the issue of the conflict between individuation and collectivity in  in individuation and collectivity cw  
is cf jungs comments in individuation and collectivity that the individual must now consolidate himself by cutting himself off from god and becoming wholly himself 
thereby and at the same time he also separates himself from society outwardly he plunges into solitude but inwardly into hell distance from god cw  ii 
is this is an interpretation of the murder of siegfried in liber primus ch  murder of the hero 
iss this refers to the dream mentioned in the prologue p   
is in black book  jung noted with a gray beard and wearing an oriental robe p  
is elijah was one of the prophets of the old testament he first appears in i kings  bearing a message from god to ahab the icing of israel in  the carmelite 
pere bruno wrote to jung asking how one established the existence of an archetype jung replied by tiling elijah as an example describing him as a highly mythical 
personage which did not prevent him from probably being a historical figure drawing together descriptions of him throughout history jung described him as a living 
archetype who represented the collective unconscious and the self he noted that such a constellated archetype gave rise to new forms of assimilation and represented 
a compensation on the part of the unconscious cw  i 
is salome was the daughter of herodias and the stepdaughter of king herod in matthew  and mark  john the baptist had told king herod that it was unlawful for 
him to be married to his brothers wife and herod put him in prison salome who is not named but simply called the daughter of herodias danced before herod on 
his birthday and he promised to give her anything she wished for she requested the head of john the baptist who was then beheaded in the late nineteenth and early

e why do you judge so you see that she is blind she is my 
daughter the daughter of the prophet 
i what miracle has united you c 
e it is no miracle it was so from the beginning my wisdom 
and my daughter are one 
i am shocked i am incapable of grasping it 
e consider this her blindness and my sight have made us 
companions through eternity 
i forgive my astonishment am i truly in the underworld 
s do you love me 
i how can i love you how do you come to this question i 
see only one thing you are salome a tiger your hands are stained 
with the blood of the holy one how should i love you 
s you will love me 
i i love you who gives you the right to such thoughts 
s i love you 
i leave me be i dread you you beast 
s you do me wrong elijah is my father and he knows the 
deepest mysteries the walls of his house are made of precious 
stones his wells hold healing water and his eyes see the things of 
the future and what wouldnt you give for a single look into the 
infinite unfolding of what is to come are these not worth a sin 
for you 
i your temptation is devilish i long to be back in the upper 
world it is dreadful here how oppressive and heavy is the air 
e what do you want the choice is yours 
i but i do not belong to the dead i live in the light of day 
why should i torment myself here with salome do i not have 
enough of my own life to deal with 
e you heard what salome said 
i i cannot believe that youthe prophet can recognize her 
as a daughter and a companion is she not engendered from hei
nous seed was she not vain greed and criminal lust 
e but she loved a holy man 
i and shamefully shed his precious blood 
e she loved the prophet who announced the new god 
to the world she loved him do you understand that for sh is 
my daughter 
i do you think that because she is your daughter she loved 
the prophet in john the father 
e by her love shall you know her i but how did she love him do you call that love 
e what else was it 
i i am horrified who wouldnt be horrified if salome 
loved him 
e are you cowardly consider this i and my daughter have 
been one since eternity 
i you pose dreadful riddles how could it be that this unholy 
woman and you the prophet of your god could be one 
e why are you amazed but you see it we are together 
i what my eyes see is exactly what i cannot grasp you elijah 
who are a prophet the mouth of god and she a bloodthirsty horror 
you are the symbol of the most extreme contradiction 
e we are real and not symbols 
i see how the black serpent writhes up the tree and hides in 
the branches everything becomes gloomy and doubtful elijah 
rises i follow and we go silently back through the halli doubt 
tears me apart it is all so unreal and yet a part of my longing 
remains behind will i come again salome loves me do i love 
her i hear wild music a tambourine a sultry moonlit night the 
bloodystaring head of the holy onelofear seizes me i rush out 
i am surrounded by the dark night it is pitch black all around 
me who murdered the hero is this why salome loves me do i 
love her and did i therefore murder the hero she is one with the 
prophet one with john but also one with me woe was she the 
hand of the god i do not love her i fear her then the spirit of the 
depths spoke to me and said therein you acknowledge her divine 
power must i love salome 
 this play that i witnessed is my play not your play it is my 
secret not yours you cannot imitate me my secret remains virginal and my 
mysteries are inviolable they belong to me and cannot belong to you you 
have your own  
he who enters into his own must grope through what lies at hand he must 
sense his way from stone to stone he must embrace the worthless and the 
worthy with the same love a mountain is nothing and a grain oj sand holds 
kingdoms or also nothing judgment must fall from you even taste but above 
all pride even when it is based on merit utterly poor miserable unknowingly 
humiliated go on through the gate turn your anger against yourself since 
only you stop yourself from looking and from living the mystery play is soft 
like air and thin smoke and you are raw matter that is disturbingly heavy 
but let your hope which is your highest good and highest ability lead the way 
 black book  continues the crystal shines dimly i think again of the image of odysseus how he passed the rocky island of the sirens on his lengthy odyssey should i 
should i not p 
 ie the head of john the baptist 
 in the  seminar jung recounted i used the same technique of the descent but this time i went much deeper the first time i should say i reached a depth of 
about one thousand feet but this time it was a cosmic depth it was like going to the moon or like the feeling of a descent into empty space first the picture was of a 
crater or a ringchain of mountains and my feeling association was that of one dead as if oneself were a victim it was the mood of the land of the hereafter i could see 
two people an old man with a white beard and a young girl who was very beautiful i assumed them to be real and listened to what they were saying the old man said 
he was elijah and i wasquite shocked but she was even more upsetting because she was salome i said to myself that there was a queer mixture salome and elijah but 
elijah assured me that he and salome had been together since eternity this also upset me with them was a black serpent who had an affinity for me i stuck to elijah 
as being the most reasonable of the lot for he seemed to have a mind i was exceedingly doubtful about salome we had a long conversation but i did not understand 
it of course i thought of the fact of my father being a clergyman as being the explanation of my having figures like this how about this old man then salome was 
not to be touched upon it was only much later that i found her association with elijah quite natural whenever you take journeys like this you find a young girl with 
an old man ftnalytical psychology pp  jung then refers to examples of this pattern in the work of melville meyrink rider haggard and the gnostic legend of 
simon magus see note  p  kundry and klingsor from wagners parsifal see below p  and francesco colonnas hypnerotomachia in memories he noted 
in myths the snake is a frequent counterpart of the hero there are numerous accounts of their affinity  therefore the presence of the snake was an indication of 
a heromyth p  of salome he said salome is an anima figure she is blind because she does not see the meaning of things elijah is the figure of the wise old 
prophet and represents the factor of intelligence and knowledge salome the erotic element one might say that the two figures are personifications of logos and eros 
but such a definition would be excessively intellectual it is more meaningful to let the figures be what they were for me at that timenamely events and experiences 
pp  in  jung wrote for purely psychological reasons i have elsewhere attempted to equate the masculine consciousness with the concept of logos 
and the feminine with that of eros by logos i meant discrimination judgment insight and by eros i meant the placing into relation mysterium coniunctionis cw  
 on jungs reading of elijah and salome in terms of logos and eros respectively see appendix b commentaries 
 the corrected draft has guiding rejfection p  the draft and corrected draft have this my friend is a mystery play in which the spirit of the depths cast me i had 
recognized thebirthofthenewod the conception and therefore the spirit of the depths allowed me to participate in the underworld ceremonies which were sup
posed to instmct me about the gods intentions and works through these rituals i was supposed to be initiated into the mysteries of redemption corrected draft p  
 the draft continues in the renewed world you can have no outer possessions unless you create them out of yourselves you can enter only into your own mysteries

and serve you as a guide in the world of darkness since it is of like substance 
with the forms of that world image v v  
the scene of the mystery play is a deep place like the crater of 
a volcano my deep interior is a volcano that pushes out the fiery
molten mass of the unformed and the undifferentiated thus my 
interior gives birth to the children of chaos of the primordial 
mother he who enters the crater also becomes chaotic matter 
he melts the formed in him dissolves and binds itself anew with 
the children of chaos the powers of darkness the ruling and the 
seducing the compelling and the alluring the divine and the 
devilish these powers stretch beyond my certainties and limits 
on all sides and connect me with all forms and with all distant 
beings and things through which inner tidings of their being and 
their character develop in me 
because i have fallen into the source of chaos into the primordial 
beginning i myself become smelted anew in the connection with 
the primordial beginning which at the same time is what has 
been and what is becoming at first i come to the primordial 
beginning in myself but because i am a part of the matter and 
formation of the world i also come into the primordial beginning 
of the world in the first place i have certainly participated in life 
as someone formed and determined but only through my formed 
and determined consciousness and through this in a formed and 
determined piece of the whole world but not in the unformed 
and undetermined aspects of the world that likewise are given to 
me yet it is given only to my depths not to my surface which is a 
formed and determined consciousness 
the powers of my depths are predetermination and pleasure 
predetermination or forethinlcing is prometheus who without 
determined thoughts brings the chaotic to form and definition 
who digs the channels and holds the object before pleasure 
forethinking also comes before thought but pleasure is the force 
that desires and destroys forms without form and definition it 
loves the form in itself that it takes hold o and destroys the forms 
that it does not talce the forethinker is a seer but pleasure is blind 
it does not foresee but desires what it touches forethinlcing is not 
powerful in itself and therefore does not move but pleasure is 
power and therefore it moves forethinlcing needs pleasure to 
be able to come to form pleasure needs forethinking to come 
to form which it requireso if pleasure lacked forming pleasure 
would dissolve in manifoldness and become splintered and 
powerless through unending division lost to the unending if 
a form does not contain and compress pleasure within itsel 
it cannot reach the higher since it always flows like water from 
above to below all pleasure when left alone flows into the deep 
sea and ends in the deathly stillness of dispersal into unending mysterium encounter i  
space pleasure is not older than forethinking and forethinking 
is not older than pleasure both are equally old and in nature 
intimately one only in man does the separate existence of both 
principles become apparent 
apart from elijah and salome i found the serpent as a third 
principle it is a stranger to both principles although it is 
associated with both the serpent taught me the unconditional 
difference in essence between the two principles in me if i look 
across from forethinking to pleasure i first see the deterrent 
poisonous serpent if i feel from pleasure across to forethinlcing 
likewise i feel first the cold cruel serpent the serpent is the 
earthly essence of man of which he is not conscious its character 
changes according to peoples and lands since it is the mystery 
that flows to him from the nourishing earthmother  
the earthly numen loci separates forethinking and pleasure 
in man but not in itself the serpent has the weight of the earth 
in itself but also its changeability and germination from which 
everything that becomes emerges it is always the serpent that causes 
man to becolne enslaved now to one now to the other principle 
so that it becomes error one cannot live with forethinking alone 
or with pleasure alone you need both but you cannot be 
in forethinking and in pleasure at the same time you must take 
turns being in forethinking and pleasure obeying the prevailing 
law unfaithful to the other so to speak but men prefer one or the 
other some love thinlcing and establish the art of life on it they 
practice their thinking and their circumspection so they lose their 
pleasure therefore they are old and have a sharp face the others 
love pleasure they practice their feeling and living thus they forget 
thinlcing therefore they are young and blind those who think 
base the world on thought those who feel on feeling you find 
truth and error in both 
the way of life writhes like the serpent from right to left and 
from left to right from thinlcing to pleasure and from pleasure 
to thinking thus the serpent is an adversary and a symbol of 
enmity but also a wise bridge that connects right and left through 
longing much needed by our life  
the place where elijah and salome live together is a dark 
space and a bright one the dark space is the space of fore
thinking it is dark so he who lives there requires vision 
this space is limited so fore thinking does not lead into the 
extended distance but into the depth of the past and the 
future the crystal is the formed thoght that reflects what is 
to come in what has gone before 
eve  and the serpent show me that my next step leads to 
pleasure and from there again on lengthy wanderings like 
odysseus he went astray when he played his trick at troy the 
 the draft continues the mystery play took place at the deepest bottom of my interior which is that other world you have to bear this in mind it is also a world 
and its reality is large and frightening you cry and laugh and tremble and sometimes you break out in a cold sweat for fear of death the mystery play represents my 
self and through me the world to which i belong is represented thus my friends you learn much about the world and through it about yoursel by what i say to you 
here but you have not learned anything about your mysteries in this way indeed your way is darker than before since my exaihple will stand obstructively in your 
path you may follow me not on my way but on yours p i 
 this depicts the scene in the fantasy 
 this is a subjective interpretation of the figures of elijah and salome 
 in the corrected drcift predetermination or forethought is replaced by the idea this substitution occurs throughout the rest of this section p  
 in greek mythology prometheus created mankind out of clay he could foretell the future and his name signifies forethought in  jung wrote an extended 
analysis of carl spittelers epic poem prometheus und epimetheus  together with goethes prometheus fragmettt  see psychological types cw  ch  
 the corrected drcift has boundary p   
 the drcift continues therefore the forethinker approached me as elijah the prophet and pleasure as salome p i 
 the drcift continues the animal of deadly horror which lay between adam and eve p i 
 the corrected draft continues the serpent is not only a separating but also a unifying principle p  
i when commenting on this in the  seminar jung noted that there were many accounts in mythology of the relation between a hero and a serpent so the presence 
of the serpent indicated that it will again be a hero myth p  he showed a diagram of a cross with rationalthinking elijall at the top feeling salome at the 
bottom irrational  intuition superior at the left and sensation  inferior serpent at the right p  he interpreted the black serpent as the introverting libido 
the serpent leads the psychological movement apparently astray into the kingdom of shadows dead and wrong images but also into earth into concretization  
inasmuch as the serpent leads into the shadows it has the function of the anima it leads you into the depths it connects the above and below  the serpent is also 
the symbol of wisdom analytical psychology pp  
 the drcift continues by following elijah and salome i follow the two principles inside me and through me in the world of which i am part p i 
 the corrected drcift continues that is of thinking and without thinking one cannot grasp an idea p  
 the drcift continues what would odysseus have been without his wandering p i the corrected drcift adds there would have been no odyssey p  fo vvvir

bright garden is the space of pleasure he who lives there needs 
no visioni he feels the unending a thinker who descends in to 
his fore thinking finds his next step leading into the garden of 
salome therefore the thinker fears his forethought although 
he lives on the foundation of fore thinking the visible surface 
is safer than the underground thinking protects against the 
way of error and therefore it leads to petrification 
a thinker should fear salome since she wants his head 
especially ifhe is a holy man a thinker cannot be a holy person 
otherwise he loses his head it does not help to hide oneself in 
thought there the solidification overtakes you you must turn 
back to motherly forethought to obtain renewal but forethought 
leads to salome 
because i was a thinker and caught sight of the hostile 
principle of pleasure from forethinking it appeared to me as 
salome if i had been one who felt and had groped my way 
toward forethinking then it would have appeared to me as a 
serpentencoiled daimon if i had actually seen it but i would 
have been blind therefore i would have felt only slippery dead 
dangerous allegedly overcome insipid and mawkish things 
and i would have pulled back with the same shudder i felt in 
turning from salome 
the thinkers passions are bad therefore he has no pleasure 
the thoughts of one who feelsl are bad therefore he has no 
thoughts he who prefers to think than to feel  leaves his 
feelingl to rot in darkness it does not grow ripe but in moldi
ness produces sick tendrils that do not reach the light he who 
prefers to feel than to think leaves his thinking in darkness 
where it spins its nets in gloomy places desolate webs in which 
mosquitos and gnats become enmeshed the thinker feels the 
disgust of feeling since the feeling in him is mainly disgusting 
the one who feels thinks the disgust of thinking since the 
thinking in him is mainly disgusting so the serpent lies between 
the thinker and the one who feels they are each others poison 
and healing 
in the garden it had to become apparent to me that i loved 
salome this recognition struck me since i had not thought it 
what a thinker does not think he believes does not exist and 
what one who feels does not feel he believes does not exist you 
begin to have a presentiment of the whole when you embrace 
your opposite pripdple since the whole belongs to both principles 
which grow from one root 
elijah said you should recognize her through her love not 
only do you venerate the object but the object also sanctifies 
you salome loved the prophet and this sanctified her the 
prophet loved god and this sanctified him but salome did not 
love god and this profaned her but the prophet did not love 
salome and this profaned him and thus they were each others poison and death may the thinking person accept his pleasure 
and the feeling person accept his own thought such leads one 
along the way

on the following nights i was led to a second image i am 
standing in the rocky depth that seems to me like a crater before 
me i see the house with columns i see salome walking along the 
length of the wall toward the left touching the wall like a blind 
person the serpent follows her the old man stands at the door 
and waves to me hesitantly i draw closer he calls salome back 
she is like someone suffering i cannot detect any sacrilege in her 
nature her hands are white and her face has a gentle expression 
the serpent lies before them i stand before them clumsily like a 
stupid boy overwhelmed by uncertainty and ambiguity the old 
man eyes me searchingly and says what do you want here 
i forgive me it is not obtrusiveness or arrogance that leads 
me here i am here perchance not knowing what i want a longing 
that stayed behind in your house yesterday has brought me here 
you see prophet i am tired my head is as heavy as lead i am 
lost in my ignorance i have toyed with myself enough i played 
hypocritical games with myself and they all would have disgusted 
me were it not clever to perform what others expect from us in 
the world of men it seems to me as if i were more real here and 
yet i do not like being here 
wordlessly elijah and salome step inside the house i follow 
them reluctantly a feeling of guilt torments me is it bad conscience 
i would like to turn back but i cannot i stand before the play 
of fire in the shining crystal i see in splendor the mother of god

 in  jung presented his paper on the question of psychological types in which he noted that the libido or psychic energy in an individual was characteristically 
directed toward the object extraversion or toward the subject introversion cw  commencing in the summer of  he had extensive correspondence with 
hans schmid on this question in which he now characterized the introverts as being dominated by the function of thinking and the extraverts as being dominated by 
the function of feeling he also characterized the extraverts as being dominated by the pleasurepain mechanism seeking out the love of the object and unconsciously 
seeking tyrannical power introverts unconsciously sought inferior pleasure and had to see that the object was also a symbol of their pleasure on august   he 
wrote to schmid the opposites should be evened out in the individual himself theungschmid correspondence eds john beebe and ernst falzeder tr ernst falzeder with tony 
woolfson philemon series forthcoming this linkage between thinking and introversion and feeling and extraversion was maintained in his discussion of this 
subject in  in the psychology ojthe unconscious processes in psychological types  this model had expanded to encompass two main attitude types of introverts 
and extraverts further subdivided by the predominance of one of the four psychological functions of thinking feeling sensation and intuition

urge toward forbidden knowledge that causes your feeling of 
guilt why do you think you are here 
 i dont know i sank into this place when unknowingly 
i tried resisting the notknown so here i am astonished and 
confused an ignorant fool i experience strange things in your 
house things that frighten me and whose meaning is dark to me 
e if it were not your law to be here how would you be here 
i im afflicted by fatal weakness my father 
e you are evasive you cannot extricate yourself from your law 
i how can i extricate myself from what is unknown to me 
which i cannot reach with either feeling or presentiment 
e you are lying do you not know that you yourself 
recognized what it means if salome loves you 
i you are right a doubtful and uncertain thought arose in 
me but i have forgotten it again 
e you have not forgotten it it burned deep inside you are 
you cowardly or can you not differentiate this thought from your 
own self enough so that you wished to claim it for yourself 
i the thought went too far for me and i shun farfetched 
ideas they are dangerous since i am a man and you know how 
much men are ccustomed to seeing thoughts as their very own 
so that they eventually confuse them with themselves 
e will you therefore confuse yourself with a tree or animal 
because you look at them and because you exist with them in one 
and the same world must you be your thoughts because you are 
in the world of your thoughts but your thoughts are just as much 
outside your self as trees and animals are outside your body 
i i understand my thought world was for me more word 
than world i thought of my thought world it is i 
e do you say to your human world and every being outside 
of you you are i 
i i stepped into your house my father with the fear of a 
schoolboy but you taught me salutary wisdoml i can also 
consider my thoughts as being outside my self that helps me 
to return to that terrible conclusion that my tongue is reluctant 
to express i thought that salome loves me because i resemble 
john or you this thought seemed unbelievable to me thats why 
i rejected it and thought that she loves me because i am really 
quite opposite to you that she loves her badness in my badness 
this thought was devastating 
elijah is silent heaviness lies on me then salome steps in comes 
over to me and lays her arm around my shoulder she takes me for 
her father in whose chair i sat i dare neither move nor spealc 
s i know that you are not my father you are his son and i 
am your sister 
i you salome my sister was this the terrible attraction that 
emanated from you that unnamable horror of you of your touch 
who was our mother instruction i  
s mary 
 is it a hellish dream mary our mother what madness 
lurks in your words the mother of our savior our mother 
when i crossed your threshold today i foresaw calamity alas it 
has come are you out of your senses salome elijah protector 
of the divine law speak is this a devilish spell cast by the rejected 
how can she say such a thing or are both of you out of your 
senses you are symbols and mary is a symbol i am simply too 
confused to see through you now 
e you may call us symbols for the same reason that you can 
also call your fellow men symbols if you wish to but we are just as 
real as your fellow men you invalidate nothing and solve noth
ing by calling us symbols 
i you plunge me into a terrible confusion do you wish to 
be real 
e we are certainly what you call real here we are and you 
have to accept us the choice is yours 
i am silent salome has removed herself uncertainly i look around 
behind me a high golden red flame burns on a round altar the 
serpent has encircled the flame its eyes glitter with golden reflections 
swaying i turn to the exit as i step out into the hall i see a powerful 
lion going before me outside it is a wide cold starry night 
 t is no small matter to acknowledge ones yearning 
for this many need to make a particular effort at honesty all 
too many do not want to know where their yearning is because 
it would seem to them impossible or too distressing and yet 
yearning is the way of life if you do not acknowledge your 
yearning then you do not follow yourself but go on foreign ways 
that others have indicated to you so you do not live your life but 
an alien one but who should live your life if you do not live it it 
is not only stupid to exchange your own life for an alien one but 
also a hypocritical game because you can never really live the life 
of others you can only pretend to do it deceiving the other and 
yourself since you can only live your own life 
if you give up your self you live it in others thereby you 
become selfish to others and thus you deceive others everyone 
thus believes that such a life is possible it is however only apish 
imitation through giving in to your apish appetite you infect 
others because the ape stimulates the apish so you turn your
self and others into apes through reciprocal imitation you live 
according to the average expectation the image of the hero was 
set up for all in every age through the appetite for imitation 
therefore the hero was murdered since we have all been aping 
him do you know why you cannot abandon apishness for fear 
of loneliness and defeat 
to live oneself means to be ones own task never say that it 
is a pleasure to live oneself it will be no joy but a long suffering 
since you must become your own creator if you want to create

 the corrected drqft has guiding reflection p  in the drqft and corrected drqft a lengthy passage occurs what follows here is a paraphrase i wonder whether 
this is real an underworld or the other reality and whether it was the other reality that had forced me here i see here that salome my pleasure moves to the left the 
side of the impure and bad this movement follows the serpent which represents the resistance and the enmity against this movement pleasure goes away from the 
door forethinking corrected drqft the idea throughout this passage stands at the door knowing the entrance to the mysteries therefore desire melts into the 
many if forethiking does not direct it and force it toward its goal if one meets a man who only desires then one will find resistance against his desire behind it desire 
without forethinking gains much but keeps nothing therefore his desire is the source of constant disappointment thus elijall calls salome back if pleasure is united 
with forethinking the serpent lies before them to succeed in something you first need to deal with the resistance and difficulty otherwise joy leaves behind pain and 
disappointment therefore i drew nearer i had first to overcome the difficulty and the resistance to gain what i desired when desire overcomes the difficulty it 
becomes seeing and follows forethinking therefore i see that salomes hands are pure with no trace of crime my desire is pure if i first overcome the difficulty and 
resistance if i weigh up pleasure and forethinking i am wee a fool blindly following his longing if i follow my thinking i forsake my pleasure the ancients said in 
images that the fool finds the right way forethinking has the first word therefore elijah asked me what i wanted you should always ask yourself what you desire since all 
too many do not know what they want i did not know what i wanted you should confess your longing and what you long for to yourself thus you satisfy your pleasure 
and nourish your forethinking at the same time corrected drqfi pp

yoursel then you do not begin with the best and the highest 
but with the worst and the deepest therefore say that you are 
reluctant to live yourself the flowing together of the stream of 
life is not joy but pain since it is power against power guilt and 
shatters the sanctified 
the image of the mother of god with the child that i foresee 
indicates to me the mystery of the transformation  if forethink
ing and pleasure unite in me a third arises from them the divine 
son who is the supreme meaning the symbol the passing over into 
a new creation i do not myself become the supreme meaning 
or the symbol but the symbol becomes in me such that it has its 
substance and i mine thus i stand like peter in worship before 
the miracle of the transformation and the becoming real of the 
god in me 
although i am not the son of the god mysel i represent him 
nevertheless as one who was a mother to the god and one there
fore to whom in the name of the god the freedom of the binding 
and loosing has been given the binding and loosing take place 
in me but insofar as it tales place in me and i am a part of the 
world it also takes place through meiin the world and no one can 
hinder it it doesnt tale place according to the way of my will but 
in the way of unavoidable effect i am not master over you but 
the being of the god in me i lock the past with one key with the 
other i open the future this takes place through my transforma
tion the miracle of transformation commands i am its servant 
just as the pope is 
you see how incredible it was to believe such of oneself it 
applies not to me but to the symbol the symbol becomes my lord 
and unfailing commander it will fortify its reign and change itself 
into astarry and riddling image whose meaning turns completely 
inward and whose pleasure radiates outward like blazing firer 
a buddha in the flames because i sink into my symbol to such 
an extent the symbol changes me from my one into my other and 
that cruel goddess of my interior my womanly pleasure my own 
other the tormented tormentor that which is to be tormented i 
have interpreted these images as best i can with poor words 
in the moment of your bewilderment follow your forethink
ing and not your blind desire since forethinking leads you to the 
difficulties that should always come first they come nevertheless if you look for a light you fall first into an even deeper darkness 
in this darkness you find a light with a weal reddish flame that 
gives only a low brightness but it is enough for you to see your 
neighbor it is exhausting to reach this goal that seems to be no 
goal and so it is good i am paralyzed and therefore ready to 
accept my forethinking rests on the lion my power  
i held to the sanctified form and didnt want to allow the 
chaos to breal through its dams i believed in the order of 
the world and hated everything disorganized and unformed 
therefore above all i had to realize that my own law had 
brought me to this place as the god developed in me i 
thought he was a part of my self i thought that my i included 
him and therefore i took him for my thought but i also considered 
that my thoughts were parts of my  thus i entered into my 
thoughts and into the thinking about the god in that i took 
him  for a part of my self 
on account of my thoughts i had left myself therefore my 
self became hungry and made god into a selfish thought if i 
leave mysel my hunger will drive me to find my self in my object 
that is in my thought therefore you love reasonable and orderly 
thoughts since you could not endure it if your self was in disordered 
that is unsuitable thoughts through your selfish wish you pushed 
out of your thoughts everything that you do not consider ordered 
that is unfitting you create order according to what you know 
you do not know the thoughts of chaos and yet they exist my 
thoughts are not my sel and my i does not embrace the thought 
your thought has this meaning and that not just one but many 
meanings no one knows how many 
my thoughts are not my sel but exactly like the things of 
the world alive and dead just as i am not damaged through 
living in a partly chaotic world so too i am not damaged if i 
live in my partly chaotic thought world thoughts are natural 
events that you do not possess and whose meaning you only 
imperfectly recognizeo thoughts grow in me like a forest 
populated by many different animals but man is domineering 
in his thinking and therefore he kills the pleasure of the forest 
and that of the wild animals man is violent in his desire and 
he himself becomes a forest and a forest animal just as i have 
freedom in the world i also have freedom in my thoughts 
freedom is conditional

i the draft and corrected draft continue the pope in rome has become an image andsymbol for us of how god becomes human and how he god becomes the 
visible lord of men thus the coming god will become the lord of the world this happens first here in me the supreme meaning becomes my lord and infallible 
commander though not only in me but perhaps in many others whom i dont know corrected draft pp  
i the corrected draft has thus i become like the buddha sitting in the flames p  
i the corrected draft continues where the idea is pleasure always is too if the idea is inside pleasure is outside therefore an air of evil pleasure envelops me a lech
erous and bloodthirsty godhead gives me this false air this happens because i must altogether suffer the becoming of the god and can therefore not separate it from 
myself at first but as long as it is not separated from me i am so seized by the idea that i am it and therefore i am also the woman associated with the idea from the 
beginning in that i receive the idea and represent it in the manner of buddha my pleasure is like the indian kali since she is buddhas other side kali however is 
salome and salome is my soul p  
i in the draft a lengthy passage occurs here a paraphrase of which follows the numbness is like a death i needed total transformation through this my meaning like 
that of the buddha went completely inside then the transformation happened i then went over to pleasure as i was a thinker as a thinker i rejected my feeling but 
i had rejected part of life then my feeling became a poisonous plant and when it awakened it was sensuality instead of pleasure the lowest and commonest form of 
pleasure this is represented by kali salome is the image of his pleasure that suffers pain since it was shut out for too long it then became apparent that salome ie 
my pleasure was my soul when i recognized this my thinking changed and ascended to the idea and then the image of elijah appeared this prepared me for the 
mystery play and showed me in advance the way of transformation that i had to undergo in the mysterium the flowing together of the forethinking with pleasure 
produces the god i recognized that the god in me wanted to become a man and i considered this and honored this and i became the servant of the god but for 
no one other than myself corrected draft it would be madness and presumption to assume that i also did this for others p no i sank into the contemplation of the 
wonder of transformation and first turned into the lower level of my pleasure and then through this i recognized my soul the smiles of elijah and salome indicate that 
they were happy at my appearance but i was in deep darkness when the way is dark so is the idea that gives light when the idea in the moment of confusion allows 
the words and not the blind longing then the words lead you to difficulty whereas it leads you to the right that is why elijah turns left to the side of the unholy and 
evil and salome turns right to the side of the correct and good she doesnt go to the garden the place of pleasure but remains in the house of the father pp  
i in the draft a passage occurs a paraphrase of which follows if i am strong so also are my intentions and presuppositions my own thought weakens and goes over 
into the idea the idea becomes strong it is supported by its own strength i recognize this in the fact that elijah is supported by the lions the lion is of stone my 
pleasure is dead and turned to stone because i did hot love salome this gave my thought the coldness of stone and from this the idea took its solidity which it 
needed to subjugate my thought it needed to be subjugated as it strove against salome since she appeared bad to it p

to certain things of the world i must say you should not be 
thus but you should be different yet first i look carefully at their 
nature otherwise i cannot change it i proceed in the same way 
with certain thoughts you change those things of the world that 
not being useful in themselves endanger your welfare proceed 
likewise with your thoughts nothing is complete and much is in 
dispute the way of life is transformation not exclusion wellbeing 
is a better judge than the law 
but as i became aware of the freedom in my thought world 
salome embraced me and i thus became a prophet since i had 
found pleasure in the primordial beginning in the forest and in 
the wild animals it stands too close to reason for me to set myself 
on a par with my visions and for me to take pleasure in seeing i 
am in danger of believing that i myself am significant since i see 
the significant this will always drive us crazy and we transform 
the vision in to foolishness and monkey business since we cannot 
desist from imitation 
just as my thinking is the son of fore thinking so is my 
pleasure the daughter of love of the innocent and conceiving 
mother of god aside from christ mary gave birth to salome 
therefore christ in the gospel of the egyptians says to salome 
eat every herb but do not eat the bitter and when salome 
wanted to know christ spoke to her if you crush the covering 
of shame and when the two become one and the male with 
the female neither male nor female 
forethinking is the procreative love is the receptive both 
are beyond this world here are understanding and pleasure 
we only suspect the other it would be madness to claim that 
they are in this world so much that is riddling and cunning

n the third night deep longing to continue experiencing 
the mysteries seized me the struggle between doubt and desire 
was great in me but suddenly i saw that i stood before a steep 
ridge in a wasteland it is a dazzling bright day i catch sight of the resolution i  
prophet high above me his hand makes an averting movement 
and i abandon my decision to climb up i wait below gazing 
upward i look to the right it is dark night to the left it is bright 
day the rock separates day and night on the dark side lies a big 
black serpent on the bright side a white serpent they thrust 
their heads toward each other eager for battle elijah stands on 
the heights above them the serpents pounce on one another and 
a terrible wrestling ensues the black serpent seems to be stronger 
the white serpent draws back great billows of dust rise from the 
place of struggle but then i see the black serpent pulls itselfback 
again the front part of its body has become white both serpents 
curl about themselves one in light the other in darkness 
elijah what did you see 
i i saw the fight of two formidable serpents it seemed to me 
as if the black would overcome the white serpent but behold the 
black one withdrew and its head and the top part of its body had 
turned white 
e do you understand that 
i i have thought it over but i cannot understand it should 
it mean that the power of the good light will become so great that 
even the darkness that resists it will be illumined by it 
elijah climbs before me into the heights to a very high summit 
i follow on the peak we come to some masonry made of huge 
blocks it is a round embankment on the summie inside lies a 
large courtyard and there is a mighty boulder in the middle like an 
altar the prophet stands on this stone and says this is the temple 
of the sun this place is a vessel that collects the light of the sun 
elijah climbs down from the stone his form becomes smaller 
in descending and finally becomes dwarflike unlike himself 
i ask who are you 
i am mime and i will show you the wellsprings the collected 
light becomes water and flows in many springs from the summit 
into the valleys of the earth he then dives down into a crevice i 
follow him down into a dark cave i hear the rippling of a spring 
i hear the voice of the dwarf from below here are my wells 
whoever drinks from them becomes wise 
but i cannot reach down i lose courage i leave the cave 
and doubting pace back and forth in the square of the yard 
everything appears to me strange and incomprehensible it is 
solitary and deathly silent here the air is clear and cool as on the 
remotest heights a wonderful flood of sunlight all around the 
 the draft continues i recognized the father because i was a thinker and thus i did not know the mother but saw love in the guise of pleasure and called it pleasure 
and therefore this was salome to me now i learn that mary is the mother the innocent and lovereceiving and not pleasure who bears the seed of evil in her heated 
and seductive nature  if salome evil pleasure is my sister then i must be a thinking saint and my intellect has met with a sad fate i must sacrifice my intellect and 
confess to you that what i told you about pleasure namely that it is the principle opposed to forethought is incomplete and prejudiced i observed as a thinker from 
the vantage point of my thinking otherwise i could have recognized that salome as elijahs daughter is an offspring of thought and not the principle itself which 
mary the innocent virgin mother now appears asp  
 the gospel of the egyptians is one of the apocryphal gospels that features a dialogue between christ and salome christ states that he has come to undo the work of 
the female namely lust birth and decay to salomes question of how long shall death prevail christ answered as long as women bear children here jung is referring 
to the following passage she said then i have done well in not giving birth imagining that it is not permitted to bear children the lord answered eat of every 
herb but the bitter one eat not  the dialogue continues when salome asked when it shall be made known the lord said when you tread under foot the covering 
of shame and when out of two is made one and the male with the female neither male nor female the apocryphal new testament ed k elliot oxford oxford 
university press  p is jung cites this logion available to him from clement in the stromateis as an example of the union of opposites in visions  vol 
 p  and as an example of the coniunctio of male and female in on the psychology of the child archetype  cw  i  and mysterium coniunctionis

 the draft and corrected drtift have but when the mystery play showed me this i didnt understand but i thought i had produced an incredible thought i alllladw
believetlris and i bdievedit therefore i was seized by fear and i wanted to explain my arbitrary thoughts to elijah and salome and thus invalidate them corrected 
drtift p lis 
 the drtift continues the image of the cool starry night and of the vast sky opens up my eye to the infinity of the inner world which i as a desirous man feel is still 
too cold i cannot pull the stars down to myself but only watch them therefore my impetuous desire feels that that world is nightly and cold p  
 this depicts a scene in the fantasy that follows 
 december   
 in the  seminar jung said a few evenings later i felt that things should continue so again i tried to follow the same procedure but it would not descend i 
remained on the surface then i realized that i had a conflict in myself about going down but i could not make out what it was i only felt that two dark principles 
were fighting each other two serpents analytical psychology p  he then recounted the fantasy that ensued 
 in the  seminar jung added i thought ha this is a druidic sacred place  analytical psychology p  
 in wagners ring of the nibelung the nibelung dwarf mime is the brother of alberich and a master craftsman alberich stole the rhinegold from the rhinemaidens 
through renouncing love he was able to forge a ring out of it that conferred limitless power in siegfried mime who lives in a cave brings up siegfried so that he will 
kill fafner the giant who has transformed into a dragon and now has the ring siegfried slays fafner with the invincible sword that mime has fashioned and kills

 i liber primus fol vi v viir 
great wall surrounds me a serpent crawls over the stone it is the 
serpent of the prophet how did it come out of the underworld 
into the world above i follow it and see how it crawls into the 
wall i feel weird allover a little house stands there with a 
portico minuscule snuggling against the rock the serpents 
become infinitely small i feel as if i too am shrinking the walls 
enlarge into a huge mountain and i see that i am below on the 
foundation of the crater in the underworld and i stand before the 
house of the prophetio he steps out of the door of his house 
i i notice elijah that you have shown me and let me 
experience all sorts of strange things and allowed me to come 
before you today but i confess that it is all dark to me your 
world appears to me today in a new light just now it was as if 
i were separated by a starry distance from your place which i 
still wanted to reach today but behold it seems to be one and 
the same place 
e you wanted to come here far too much i did not deceive 
you you deceived yourself he sees badly who wants to see you 
have overreached yourself 
i it is true i eagerly longed to reach you to hear more 
salome startled me and led me into bewilderment i felt dizzy 
because what she said seemed to me to be monstrous and like 
madness where is salome 
e how impetuous you are what is up with you step over to 
the crystal and prepare yourself in its light 
a wreath of fire shines around the stone i am seized with 
fear at what i see the coarse peasants boot the foot of a 
giant that crushes an entire city i see the cross the removal 
of the cross the mourning how agonizing this sight is no 
longer do i yearni see the divine child with the white serpent 
in his right hand and the black serpent in his left hand i see 
the green mountain the cross of christ on it and a stream of 
blood flowing from the summit of the mountain i can look no 
longer it is unbearable i see the cross and christ on it in his last 
hour and tormentat the foot of the cross the black serpent 
coils itselfit has wound itself around my feetlam held fast and i spread my arms wide salome draws near the serpent 
has wound itself around my whole body and my countenance 
is that of a lion 
salome says mary was the mother of christ do you understand 
 i see that a terrible and incomprehensible power forces me 
to imitate the lord in his final torment but how can i presume 
to call mary my mother 
s you are christ 
i stand with outstretched arms like someone crucified my 
body taut and horribly entwined by the serpent you salome say 
that i am christii 
it is as if i stood alone on a high mountain with stiff 
outstretched arms the serpent squeezes my body in its terrible 
coils and the blood streams from my body spilling down the 
mountainside salome bends down to my feet and wraps her 
black hair round them she lies thus for a long time then she 
cries i see light truly she sees her eyes are open the serpent 
falls from my body and lies languidly on the ground i stride 
over it and lmeel at the feet of the prophet whose form shines 
like a flame 
e your work is fulfilled here other things will come seek 
untiringly and above all write exactly what you see 
salome looks in rapture at the light that streams from the 
prophet elijah transforms into a huge flame of white light the 
serpent wraps itself around her foot as if paralyzed salome 
kneels before the light in wonders truck devotion tears fall from 
my eyes and i hurry out into the night like one who has no part 
in the glory of the mystery my feet do not touch the ground of 
this earth and it is as if i were melting into airi 
 my longing led me up to the overbright day whose light 
is the opposite to the dark space of forethinking the opposite 
principle is as i think i understand it heavenly love the mother 
the darkness that surrounds forethinking appears to be due to 
the fact that it is invisible in the interior and tales place in the 
depths but the brightness of love seems to come from the fact 
that love is visible life and action my pleasure was with fore
thinlcing and had its merry garden there surrounded by darkness 
io in the  seminar jung interpreted this episode as follows the fight of the two snakes the white means a movement into the day the black into the kingdom of 
darkness with moral aspects too there was a real conflict in me a resistance to going down mystronger tendency was to go up because i had been so impressed 
the day before with the cruelty of the place i had seen i really had a tendency to find a way to the conscious by going up as i did on the mountain  elijah said that 
it was just the same below or above compare dantes inferno the gnostics express this same idea in the symbol of the reversed cones thus the mountain and the 
crater are similar there was nothing of conscious structure in these fantasies they were just events that happened so i assume that dante got his ideas from the same 
archetypes analytical psychology pp  mcguire suggests that jung is referring to dantes conception of the conical form of the cavity of hell with its circles 
mirroring in reverse the form of heaven with its spheres ibid in aion jung also noted that serpents were a typical pair of opposites and that the conflict between 
serpents was a motif found in medieval alchemy  cw   
ii in the  seminar jung recounted that after salomes declaration that he was christ in spite of my objections she maintained this i said this is madness and 
became filled with skeptical resistance analytical psychology p  he interpreted this event as follows salomes approach and her worshiping of me is obviously that 
side of the inferior function which is surrounded by an aura of evil one is assailed by the fear that perhaps this is madness this is how madness begins this is mad
ness  you cannot get conscious of these unconscious facts without giving yourself to them if you can overcome your fear of the unconscious and can let yourself go 
down then these facts take on a life of their own you can be gripped by these ideas so much that you really go mad or nearly so these images have so much reality 
that they recommend themselves and such extraordinary meaning that one is caught they form part of the ancient mysteries in fact it is such fantasies that made the 
mysteries compare the mysteries of isis as told in apuleius with the initiation and deification of the initiate  one gets a peculiar feeling from being put through 
such an initiation the important part that led up to the deification was the snales encoiling of me salomes performance was deification the animal face which i 
felt mine transformed into was the famous deus leontocephalus of the mithraic mysteries the figure which is represented with a snake coiled around the man the 
snakes head resting on the mans head and the face of the man that of a lion  in this deification mystery you make yourself into the vessel and are a vessel of cre
ation in which the opposites reconcile he added all this is mithraic symbolism from beginning to end ibid pp  in the golden ass lucian undergoes an 
initiation into the mysteries of isis the significance of this episode is that it is the only direct description of such an initiation that has survived of the event itself 
lucian states i approached the very gates cif death and set foot on prosperines threshold yet was permitted to retur rapt through all the elements at midnight i saw the sun shining as if it 
were noon i entered the presence of the gods of the underworld and the gods of the upperworld stood near and worshiped them after this he was presented on a pulpit in the temple in 
front of a crowd he wore garments which included designs of serpents and winged lions held a torch and wore a palm tree chaplet with its leaves sticking all out like 
rays of light the golden ass tr r graves harmondsworth penguin  p  jungs copy of a german translation of this work has a line in the margin by this passage 
 in on the psychology of the kore figure  jung described these episodes as follows in an underground house actually in the underworld there lives an old 
magician and prophet with his daughter she is however not reallyhis daughter she is a dancer a very loose person but is blind and seeks healing cw   
this description of elijah draws him together with the later description of philemon jung noted that this shows the unlmown woman as a mythological figure in the 
beyond that means in the unconscious she is soror orfilia mystica of a hierophant or philosopher evidently a parallel to those mystic syzigies which are to be met 
with in the figures of simon magus and helen zosimus and theosebia comarius and cleopatra etc our dreamfigure fits in best with helen ibid  
 the corrected drqft has guiding reflection p  in black book  jung copied the following citations from dantes commedia in german translation p  
nd i to him i am one who when love  breathes on me notices and in the manner  that he dictates within i utter words  purgatorio   and then

tol viv viir and night i climbed down to my pleasure but ascended to my 
love i see elijah high above me this indicates that forethinking 
stands nearer to love than  a man do before i ascend to love 
a condition must be fulfilled which represents itself as the fight 
between two serpents left is day right is night the realm of love 
is light the realm of forethinking is dark both principles have 
separated themselves strictly and are even hostile to one another 
and have taken on the form of serpents this form indicates the 
daimonic nature of both principles i recognize in this struggle a 
repetition of that vision where i saw the struggle between the sun 
and the black serpent 
at that time the loving light was annihilated and blood began 
to pour out this was the great war but the spirit of the depths 
wants this struggle to be understood as a conflict in every mans 
own nature since after the death of the hero our urge to live 
could no longer imitate anything it therefore went into the depths 
of every man and excited the terrible conflict between the powers 
of the depths forethinking is singleness love is togetherness 
both need one another and yet they kill one another since men 
do not know that the conflict occurs inside themselves they go 
mad  and one lays the blame on the other if onehalf of mankind 
is at fault then every man is half at fault but he does not see the 
conflict in his own soul which is however the source of the outer 
disaster if you are aggravated against your brother think that you 
are aggravated against the brother in you that is against what in 
you is similar to your brother 
as a man you are part of mankind and therefore you have 
a share in the whole of mankind as if you were the whole of 
mankind if you overpower and kill your fellow man who is 
contrary to you then you also kill that person in yourself and 
have murdered a part of your life the spirit of this dead man 
follows you and does not let your life become joyful you need 
your wholeness to live onward 
if i myself endorse the pure principle i step to one side and 
become onesided therefore my forethinking in the principle 
of the heavenly mother becomes an ugly dwarf who lives in a 
dark cave like an unborn in the womb you do not follow him 
even if he says to you that you could drinlc wisdom from his 
source but forethinking appears to you there as dwarfish 
cleverness false and of the night just as the heavenly mother 
appears to me down there as salome that which is lacking in the 
pure principle appears as the serpent the hero strives after the 
utmost in the pure principle and therefore he finally falls for the resolution i  
serpent if you go to thinlcing take your heart with you if you 
go to love talce your head with you love is empty without thinking 
thinking hollow without love the serpent lurks behind the pure 
principle therefore i lost courage until i found the serpent that 
at once led me across to the other principle in climbing down i 
become smaller 
great is he who is in love since love is the present act of the 
great creator the present moment of the becoming and lapsing of 
the world mighty is he who loves but whoever distances himself 
from love feels himself powerful 
in your forethinlcing you recognize the nullity of your current 
being as a smallest point between the infinity of what has passed 
and of what is to come the thinlcer is small he feels great if he 
distances himself from thinking but if we speak about appear
ances it is the other way around to whoever is in love form is a 
trifling but his field of vision ends with the form given to him 
to whoever is in thinking form is unsurpassable and the height 
of heaven but at night he sees the diversity of the innumer
able worlds and their neverending cycles whoever is in love is 
a full and overflowing vessel and awaits the giving whoever is 
  in fore thinking is deep and hollow and awaits fulfillment 
love and forethinlcing are in one and the same place love 
cannot be without fore thinking and forethinking cannot be 
without love man is always too much in one or the other this 
comes with human nature animals and plants seem to have 
enough in every way only man staggers between too much and 
too little he wavers he is uncertain how much he must give 
here and how much there his knowledge and ability is 
insufficient and yet he must still do it himself man doesnt only 
grow from within himsel for he is also creative from within 
himself the god becomes revealed in him human nature is 
little skilled in divinity and therefore man fluctuates between 
too much and too little 
the spirit of this time has condemned us to haste you have 
no more futurity and no more past if you serve the spirit of this 
time we need the life of eternity we bear the future and the past 
in the depths the future is old and the past is young you serve 
the spirit of this time and believe that you are able to escape the 
spirit of the depths but the depths do not hesitate any longer 
and will force you into the mysteries of christ it belongs to 
this mystery that man is not redeemed through the hero but 
becomes a christ himself the antecedent example of the saints 
symbolically teaches us this 
 ie in ch  descent into hell in the future 
 the corrected draft has the spirit p 
 the draft continues therefore they all say that they are fighting for the good and for peace but one cannot fight one another over the good but since men dont 
know that the conflict lies within themselves the germans thus believe that the english and the russians are wrong but the english and the russians say that the 
germans are wrong but no one can judge history in terms of right and wrong because onehalf of mankind is wrong every man is half wrong therefore a conflict 
resides in his own soul but man is blind and always knows only his half the german has in him the english and the russian whom he fights outside of himself 
likewise the english and the russian has in him the german whom he fights but man appears to see the outer quarrel not the one within which alone is the wellspring 
of the great war but before man can ascend to light and love the great battle is needed p 
 in december ii in his preface to the psychology of the unconscious processess jung wrote the psychological processes which accompany the present war above all the 
incredible brutalization of public opinion the mutual slanderings the unprecedented fury of destruction the monstrous flood of lies and mans incapacity to call a halt 
to the bloody demonare suited like nothing else to powerfully push in front of the eyes of thinking men the problem of the restlessly slumbering chaotic unconscious 
under the ordered world of consciousness this war has pitilessly revealed to civilized man that he is still a barbarian  but the psychology of the individual corresponds to the 
psychology of the nation what the nation does is done also by each individual and so long as the individual does it the nation also does it only the change in the attitude ofthe individual 
is the beginning of the change in the psychology of the nation cw  p  
 the corrected draft has the prophet the personification of the idea p i 
 the corrected draft has idea p ii 
 the corrected draft has idea substituted throughout this paragraph p i 
 the corrected draft adds conscious and deletes from within himself p i 
 the draft and corrected draft have instead the divine creative power becomes in him aperson a personal consciousness from the unconscious collective pp 
 the draft and corrected draft have but why you ask does forethinking the idea appear to you in the guise of a jewish prophet and your the pleasure in the guise of 
the heathen salome my friend do not forget that i too am one who thinks and wants in the spirit of this time and is completely under the spell of the serpent 
i am just now through my initiation into the mysteries of the spirit of the depths about to not entirely discard all the ancientness lacked by those thinking in the 
spirit of this time but to readopt it into my being human to malce my life whole for i have become poor and far removed from god i must take in the divine and 
the mundane since the spirit of this time had nothing else to give me on the contrary he took the little that i possessed of real life but in particular he made me hasty 
and greedy since he is merely the present and he forced me to hunt down everything present to fill the moment pp i 
 the draft and corrected draft have just as the old prophets ancients stood before the mysterium of christ i also stand as yet before the this mysterium ofchrist 
insofar as i reassume the past although i live two thousand years afterhim later and at one time believed i was a christian but i had never been a christ p i

 i liber primus fo viir 
whoever wants to see will see badly it was my will that 
deceived me it was my will that provoked the huge uproar among 
the daimons should i therefore not wantanything i have and i 
have fulfilled my will as well as i could and thus i fed everything 
in me that strived in the end i found that i wanted myself in 
everything but without looking for myself therefore i no longer 
wanted to seek myself outside of myself but within then i 
wanted to grasp myself and then i wanted to go on again without 
knowing what i wanted and thus i fell into the mystery 
should i therefore not want anything anymore you wanted 
this war that is good if you had not then the evil of this war 
would be smal but with your wanting you make the evil great 
if you do not succeed in producing the greatest evil out of this 
war you will never learn the violent deed and learn to overcome 
fighting what lies outside you therefore it is good if you want 
this greatest evil with your whole heart you are christians and 
run after heroes and wait for redeemers who should take the 
agony on themselves for you and totally spare you golgotha 
with that you pile up a mountain of calvary over all europe 
if you succeed in maldng a terrible evil out of this war and throw 
innumerable victims into this abyss this is good since it makes 
each of you ready to sacrifice himself for as i you draw close to 
the accomplishment of christs mystery  
you already feel the fist of the iron one on your back this is 
the beginning of the way if blood fire and the cry of distress 
fill this world then you will recognize yourself in your acts 
drink your fill of the bloody atrocities of the war feast upon the 
killing and destruction then your eyes will open you will see 
that you yourselves are the bearers of such fruit you are on the 
 way if you will all this willing creates blindness and blindness 
leads to the way should we will error you should not but you 
do will that error which you take for the best truth as men have 
always done 
the symbol of the crystal signifies the unalterable law of 
events that comes of itself in tlijs seed you grasp what is to 
come i saw something terrible and incomprehensible it was 
on the night of christmas day of the year  i saw the 
peasants boot the sign of the horrors of the peasant war of 
murdering incendiaries and of bloody cruelty i knew to interpret 
this sign for myself as nothing but the fact that something 
bloody and dreadful lay before us i saw the foot of a giant that 
crushed a whole city how could i interpret this sign otherwise 
i saw that the way to selfsacrifice began here they will all become 
terribly enraptured by these tremendous experiences and in their blindness will want to understand them as outer events it is an 
inner happening that is the way to the perfection of the mystery 
of christ so that the peoples learn selfsacrifice 
may the frightfulness become so great that it can turn mens 
eyes inward so that their will no longer seeks the self in others 
but in themselves i saw it i know that this is the way i saw 
the death of christ and i saw his lament i felt the agony of his 
dying of the great dying i saw a new god a child who subdued 
daimons in his hand the god holds the separate principles in 
his power he unites them the god develops through the union 
of the principles in me he is their union 
if you will one of these principles so you are in one but far 
from your being other if you will both principles one and the 
other then you excite the conflict between the principles since 
you cannot want both at the same time from this arises the 
need the god appears in it he takes your conflicting will in his 
hand in the hand of a child whose will is simple and beyond 
conflict you cannot learn this it can only develop in you you 
cannot will this it takes the will from your hand and wills itself 
will yourself that leads to the way  
but fundamentally you are terrified of yourself and therefore 
you prefer to run to all others rather than to yourself i saw 
the mountain of the sacrifice and the blood poured in streams 
from its sides when i saw how pride and power satisfied men 
how beauty beamed from the eyes of women when the great war 
broke out i knew that mankind was on the way to selfsacrifice 
the spirit of the depths has seized mankind and forces 
selfsacrifice upon it do not seek the guilt here or there the 
spirit of the depths clutched the fate of man unto itself as it 
clutched mine he leads mankind through the river of blood 
to the mystery in the mystery man himself becomes the two 
principles the lion and the serpent 
because i also want my being other i must become a christ i 
am made into christ i must suffer it thus the redeeming blood 
flows through the selfsacrifice my pleasure is changed and goes 
above into its higher principle love is sighted but pleasure is 
blind both principles are one in the symbol of the flame the 
principles strip themselves of human formo 
the mystery showed me in images what i should afterward 
live i did not possess any of those boons that the mystery showed 
me for i still had to earn all of them 
finis part prim end of part one 
 in thus spoke zarathustra nietzsche wrote to redeem the past and to transform every it was into an i wanted it thus that alone do i call redemption of 
redemption p  
 on february ii  jung said in a discussion at the association for analytical psychology we abuse the will natural growth is subjugated to the will  
war teaches us the will is of no usewe will see where this leads we are completely subject to the absolute power of the becoming map vo i p i

 the corrected draft has and we called ourselves christians imitators of christ to be christ onself is the true following of christ p  
 this may refer to the german peasants rebellion of  
 in  in his preface to the second edition of the psychology of the unconscious processes jung wrote the spectacle of this catastrophe threw man back on himself by 
making him feel his complete impotence it qtrned him inward and with everything rocking he seeks something that guarantees him a hold too many still seek 
outward  but still too few seek inward to their own selves and still fewer ask themselves whether the ends of human society might not best be served if each man 
tries to abolish the old order in himsel and to practice in his own person and in his own inward state those precepts those victories which he preaches at every street
corner instead of always expecting these things of his fellow men cw  p  
 the draft has if this doesnt happen christ will not be overcome and the evil must become even greater therefore my friend i say this to you so that you can tell 
your friends and that the word may spread among the people p

the river of blood just as he led me i experienced in the mysterium what the people wereforced to do in actualitywhich happened outside on a large scale ichd
notknowitbntthemysterium taught me howmywillinglaiditselfatthefeet of the crucifiedgod i experienced wanted christs selfsacrifice the mysterium of 
ghrist completed itself in front of my eyes myforethinking the idea standing above me forced me to this but i resisted my highest desire my lions myhottest
andstrongestpassion i wanted to rise up against the mysterious will to selfsacrifice so i was like a lion encircled by the serpent an image of fate eternally renewing 
itself salome came to me from the right the favorable side pleasureawakenedinme i experienced that my pleasure comes to me when i accomplish the selfsacrifice 
i hear that maria thesymbol oflove is also the my mother of christ since love has also borne christ love brings the selfsacrificer and selfsacrifice love is also 
the mother of my selfsacrifice in that i hear and accept this i experience that i become christ since i recognize that love makes me into christ but i still doubt 
since it is nearly impossible for the thinker to differentiate himself from his thought and accept that what happens in his thought is also something outside of himself 
ftisoutsidehimin the inner world i become christ inthemysteriumrather i see howwasmade into christandyetamcompletely mysel so that i could still 
dottbtwherrmyplesuretold me that iwaschrist salome my pleasure said to me that i am christ because love which is higher than pleasure which however 
is still in me hidden in pleasure had led me to selfsacrifice and made me into christ pleasure came near to me encircled me in rings and forced me to experience the 
torment of christ and to spill my blood for the world my willing which earlier served the spiritofthistime zeitgeist substituted throughout went under to the 
spirit of the depths and just as it was previously determined by the spirit of the time it is now determined by the spirit of the depths by forethinking idea substituted 
throughout and pleasure it determined me through the willing of selfsacrifice and to the spilling of blood my lifes essence mark that it is my bad pleasure which 
leads me to selfsacrifice its innermost is love which will be freed from pleasure through sacrifice here the wonder happened that my previously blind pleasure 
became sighted my pleasure was blind and it was love since my strongest willing willed selfsacrifice my pleasure changed it went into a higher principle which in 
god is one with forethinking love is sighted but pleasure is blind pleasure always wants what is closest and feels through the multiplicity going from one to another 
without a goal just seeking and never fulfilled love wants what is furthest the best and the fulfilling and i saw omething further namely that the forethinking in 
me had the form of an old prophet which showed that it was prechristian and transformed itself into a principle that no longer appeared in a human form but in 
the absolute form of a pure white light othe humanrelarive transformed itself into the divine absolute thro forethinking and pleasure 
united in me in a new form and the willing in me which appeared foreign and dangerous the willing of the spirit of the depths layparalyzedarthefeet of the shining 
flame i became one with my will this happened in me i just saw it in the mysteryplayrhrough this much was madeknown that i didnt previottslyknow like in 
a play but i found everything doubtful i felt as if he was melting in the air since the land of themysterium that spirit was still foreign to me themysterium
showed me the thingswhichlaybefore me and had   but that image of the sighted salome who knelt in rapture 
before the white flame was a strong feeling that came to the side of my will and led me through everything that came after what happened was my wandering with

 gilles ispel reports that jung told the dutch poet roland horst that he had written psychological types on the basis of thirty pages of the red book cited in stephan 
hoeller the gnosticung and the seven sermons to the dead wheaton  est  p  it is likely that he had in mind these preceding three chapters of the 
mysterium what is presented here develops the notions of the conflict between opposing functions the identification with the leading function and the development of 
the reconciling symbol as a resolution of the conflict of opposites which are the central issues in chapter  of psychological types cw  the type problem in poetry 
in his  seminar jung said i found that the unconscious is working out enormous collective fantasies just as before i was passionately interested in worlcing out 
myths now i became just as much interested in the material of the unconscious this is in fact the only way of getting at myth formation and so the first chapter of 
the psychology of the unconscious became most correctly true i watched the creation of myths going on and got an insight into the structure of the unconscious forming 
thus the concept that plays such a role in the types i drew all my empirical material from my patients but the solution of the problem i dlew from the inside from my 
observations of the unconscious processes i have tried to fuse these two currents of outer and inner experience in the book of the types and have termed the process 
of the fusion of the two currents the transcendent function analytical psychology p

hi jnolite au dire verba prophetarum qui prophetant vobis et decipiunt 
vos vision em cordis sui loquuntur non de ore domini audivi quae dixerunt 
prophetae prophetantes in nomine mea mendacium atque dicentes somniavi 
somniavi usquequo istud est in corde prophetarum vaticinantium mendacium 
et prophetantium seductionem cordis sui qui volunt facere ut obliviscatur 
populus meus nominis mei propter somnia eorum quae narrant unusquisque 
ad proximum suum sicut obliti sunt patres eorum nominis mei propter baal 
propheta qui habet somnium narret somnium et qui habet sermonem meum 
loquatur sermonem meum vere quid paleis ad triticum dicit dominus 
hearken not unto the words of the prophets that prophesy 
unto you they make you vain they speak a vision of their own 
heart and not out of the mouth of the lord jeremiah  j 
i have heard what the prophets said that prophesy lies in my 
name saying i have dreamed i have dreamed how long shall 
this be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies yea 
they are prophets of the deceit of their own heart which think 
to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which 
they tell every man to his neighbour as their fathers have 
forgotten my name for baal the prophet that hath a dream 
let him tell a dream and he that hath my word let him speal my 
word faithfully what is the chaff to the wheat saith the lord 
jeremiah   j  
the red one 
cap i 
hi  j the door of the mysterium has closed behind me i 
feel that my will is paralyzed and that the spirit of the depths 
possesses me i know nothing about a way i can therefore neither 
want this nor that since nothing indicates to me whether i 
want this or that i wait without knowing what im waiting for 
but already in the following night i felt that i had reached a 
solid point 
 find that i am standing on the highest tower of a castle the 
air tells me so i am far back in time my gaze wanders widely 
over solitary countryside a combination of fields and forests i 
am wearing a green garment a horn hangs from my shoulder i 
am the tower guard i look out into the distance i see a red point 
out there it comes nearer on a winding road disappearing for a 
while in forests and reappearing again it is a horseman in a red 
coat the red horseman he is coming to my castle he is already 
riding through the gate i hear steps on the stairway the steps 
creak he knocks a strange fear comes over me there stands the 
red one his long shape wholly shrouded in red even his hair is 
red i think in the end he will turn out to be the devil 
the red one i greet you man on the high tower i saw you 
from afar looking and waiting your waiting has called me 
i the handwritten draft has the adventures of the wandering p the red one i  
i who are you 
t r who am i you think i am the devil do not pass 
judgment perhaps you can also talk to me without knowing who 
i am what sort of a superstitious fellow are you that immediately 
you think of the devil 
i if you have no supernatural ability how could you feel that 
i stood waiting on my tower looking out for the unknown and 
the new my life in the castle is poor since i always sit here and 
no one climbs up to me 
t r so what are you waiting for 
i i await all kijds of things and especially im waiting for some 
of the worlds wealth which we dont see here to come to me 
t r so i have come to absolutely the right place i have 
i 
wandered a long time through the world seeking those like you 
who sit upon a high tower on the lookout for things unseen 
i you make me curious you seem to be a rare breed your 
appearance is not ordinary and then tooforgive meit seems 
to me that you bring with you a strange air something worldly 
something impudent or exuberant orin factsomething pagan 
t r you dont offend me on the contrary you hit your nail 
on the head but im no old pagan as you seem to think 
i i dont want to insist on that you are also not pompous and 
latin enough you have nothing classical about you you seem to 
be a son of our time but as i must remark a rather unusual one 
youre no real pagan but the kind of pagan who runs alongside 
our christian religion 
t r youre truly a good diviner of riddles youre doing 
better than many others who have totally mistalen me 
i you sound cool and sneering have you never broken your 
heart over the holiest mysteries of our christian religion 
t r youre an unbelievably ponderous and serious person 
are you always so urgent 
i i would before god always like to be as serious and true to 
myself as i try to be however that certainly becomes difficult in 
your presence you bring a certain gallows air with you and youre 
bound to be from the black school of salernos where pernicious 
arts are taught by pagans and the descendants of pagans 
t r youre superstitious and too german you take literally 
what the scriptures say otherwise you could not judge me so hatd 
 i a hard judgment is the last thing i would want but my 
nose does not play tricks on me youre evasive and dont want to 
reveal yourself what are you hiding 
the red one seems to get redder his garments shine like 
glowing iron 
t r i hide nothing from you you truehearted soul i simply 
amuse myself with your weighty seriousness and your comic 
veracity this is so rare in our time especially in men who have 
understanding at their disposal 
i i believe you cannot fully understand me you apparently 
compare me with those whom you know but i must say to you 
for the sake of truth that i neither really belong to this time nor 
 in his essay on picasso in  jung described the paintings of schizophrenicsmeaning here only those in which a psychic disturbance would probably produce 
schizoid symptoms rather than people who suffered from this conditionas follows from a purely formal point of view the main characteristic is one ofjfagmentation 
which expresses itself in the socalled lines of fracture that is a type of psychic fissure which runs right through the picturecw is b 
 these passages in latin from the bible were cited by jung in psychological types  from luthers bible and introduced with the following comments the form 
in which christ presented the content of his unconscious to the world became accepted and was delared valid for all thereafter all individual fantasies became otiose 
and worthless and were persecuted as heretical as the fate of the gnostic movement and of all later heresies testifies the prophet jeremiah is speaking just in this vein 
when he warns cw  bi

 i liber secundus  
to this place a spell has banished me to this place and time for 
years i am really not what you see before you 
t r you say astounding things who are you then 
i that is irrelevant i stand before you as that which i presently 
am why am i here and like this i do not know but i do know 
that i must be here to justify myself according to my best knowledge 
i know just as little who you are as you know who i am 
t r that sounds very strange are you something of a saint 
hardly a philosopher since you have no aptitude for scholarly 
language but a saint surely that your solemnity smells of 
fanaticism you have an ethical air and a simplicity that smacks 
of stale bread and water 
i i can say neither yes nor no you spealc as one trapped in 
the spirit of this time it seems to me that you lack the terms 
of comparison 
t r perhaps you attended the school of the pagans you 
answer like a sophist how can you then measure me with the 
yardstick of the christian religion if you are no saint 
i it seems to me though that one can apply this yardstick 
even if one is no saint i believe i have learned that no one is allowed 
to avoid the mysteries of the christian religion unpunished i 
repeat he whose heart has not been broken over the lord jesus 
christ drags a pagan around in himsel who holds him back from 
the best 
t r again this old tune what for if you are not a christian 
saint are you not a damned sophist after all 
i you are ensnared in your own world but you certainly 
seem to think that one can assess the worth of christianity 
correctly without being a downright saint 
t r are you a doctor of theology who examines christianity 
from the outside and appreciates it historically and therefore a 
sophist after all 
i youre stubborn what i mean is that its hardly a coincidence 
that the whole world has become christian i also believe that it 
was the task of western man to carry christ in his heart and to 
grow with his suffering death and resurrection 
t r well there are also jews who are good people and yet 
had no need for your solemn gospels 
i you are it seems to me no good reader of people have 
you never noticed that the jew himself lacks somethingone 
in his head another in his heart and he himself feels that he 
lacks something 
 t r indeed im no jew but i must come to the jews defense 
you seem to be a jew hater 
i well now you speak like all those jews who accuse anyone 
of jew hating who does not have a completely favorable judgment 
while they themselves make the bloodiest jokes about their own 
kind since the jews only too clearly feel that particular lack and yet 
do not want to admit it they are extremely sensitive to criticism 
do you believe that christianity left no mark on the souls of men 
and do you believe that one who has not experienced this most 
intimately can still partake of its fruit t r you argue your case well but your solemnity you 
could make matters much easier for yourself if youre no saint 
i really dont see why you have to be so solemn you wholly 
spoil the fun what the devil is troubling you only christianity 
with its mournful escape from the world can make people  so 
ponderous and sullen 
i i think there are still other things that bespeak seriousness 
t r oh i know you mean life i know this phrase i too live 
and dont let my hair turn white over it life doesnt require any 
seriousness on the contrary its better to dance through lifeii 
i i know how to dance yes would we could do it by dancing 
dancing goes with the mating season i know that there are those 
who are always in heat and those who also want to dance for their 
gods some are ridiculous and others enact antiquity instead of 
honestly admitting their utter incapacity for such expression 
t r here my dear fellow i doff my mask now i grow 
somewhat more serious since this concerns my own province 
its conceivable that there is some third thing for which dancing 
would be the symbol 
the red of the rider transforms itself into a tender reddish 
flesh color and beholdoh miraclemy green garments 
everywhere burst into leaf 
i perhaps too there is a joy before god that one can call 
dancing but i havent yet found this joy i look out for things that 
are yet to come things came but joywas not among them 
t r dont you recognize me brother i am joy 
i could you be joy i see you as through a cloud your image 
fades let me take your hand beloved who are you who are you 
joy was he joy 
 surely this red one was the devil but my devil that is he 
was my joy the joy of the serious person who keeps watch alone 
on the high towerhis redcolored redscented warm bright 
red joy not the secret joy in his thoughts and in his looking but 
that strange joy of the world that comes unsuspected like a warm 
southerly wind with swelling fragrant blossoms and the ease of 
living you know it from your poets this seriousness when they 
expectantly look toward what happens in the depths sought out 
first of all by the devil because of their springlike joy it picks up 
men like a wave and drives them forth whoever tastes this joy 
forgets himself  and there is nothing sweeter than forgetting 
oneself and not a few have forgotten what they are but even 
more have taken root so firmly that not even the rosy wave is able 
to uproot them they are petrified and too heavy while the others 
are too light 
i earnestly confronted my devil and behaved with him as with 
a real person this i learned in the mysterium to take seriously 
every unknown wanderer who personally inhabits the inner world 
since they are real because they are effectual it does not help that 
we say in the spirit of this time there is no devil there was one 
 the sophists were greek philosophers in the fourth and fifth centuries bce centered in athens and included figures such as protagoras gorgias and hippias they 
gave lectures and took on students for fees and paid particular attention to teaching rhetoric platos attack in a number of dialogues gave rise to the modern negative 
connotation of the term as one who plays with words 
 the drqft continuesno one can flout the spiritual development of many centuries and reap what they have not sowed p  
ii in nietzsches thus spoke zarathustra zarathustra admonishes the overcoming of the spirit of gravity and urges you higher men the worst thing about you is none of 
you has learned to dance as a man ought to danceto dance beyond yourselves of the higher men p  
 in a seminar in  jung discussed the historical transformation of the figure of the devil he noted that when he appears red he is of a fiery that is passionate 
nature and causes wantonness hate or unruly love see childrens dreams notesfrom the seminar given in  eds lorenz jung and maria meyergrass tr ernst 
falzeder and tony woolfson princeton princeton university pressphilemon series  p 
 the drqft continues you have heard from faust about how commanding this kind of joy is p  the reference is to goethes faust 
 the drqft has s you have known from faust there are many who forget who they were because they let themselves be swept away p  
 jung elaborated this point in  while presenting the method of active imagination  against this the scientific credo of our time has developed a superstitious phobia 
about fantasy but the real is what works the fantasies of the unconscious workthere can be no doubt about that the relations between the i and the unconscious cw

with me this took place in me i did with him what i could i 
could speak with him a religious conversation is inevitable with 
the devil since he demands it if one does not want to surrender 
to him unconditionally because religion is precisely what the 
devil and i cannot agree about i must have it out with him as 
i cannot expect that he as an independent personality would 
accept my standpoint without further ado 
i would be fleeing if i did not try to come to an understanding 
with him if ever you have the rare opportunity to speak with the 
devil then do not forget to confront him in all seriousness he is 
your devil after all the devil as the adversary is your own other 
standpoint he tempts you and sets a stone in your path where you 
least want it 
taking the devil seriously does not mean going over to his 
side or else one becomes the devil rather it means coming to an 
understanding thereby you accept your other standpoint with 
that the devil fundamentally loses ground and so do you and 
that may be well and good 
although the devil very much abhors religion for its particular 
solemnity and candor it has become apparent however that it 
is precisely through religion that the devil can be brought to an 
understanding what i said about dancing struck him because i 
spoke about something that belonged in his own domain he fails 
to take seriously only what concerns others because that is the 
peculiarity of all devils in such a manner i arrive at his seriousness 
and with this we reach common  ground where understanding is 
possible the devil is convinced that dancing is neither lust nor 
madness but an expression of joy which is something proper to 
neither one nor the other in this i agree with the devil therefore 
he humanizes himself before my eyes but i turn green like a 
tree in spring 
yet that joy is the devil or that the devil is joy has got to 
worry you i pondered this for over a week and i fear that it has 
not been enough you dispute the fact that your joy is your devil 
but it seems as if there is always something devilish about joy if 
your joy is no devil for you then possibly it is for your neighbors 
since joy is the most supreme flowering and greening of life this 
knocks you down and you must grope for a new path since the 
light in that joyful fire has completely gone out for you or your 
joy tears your neighbor away and throws him off course since life 
is like a great fire that torches everything in its vicinity but fire is 
the element of the devil 
when i saw that the devil is joy surely i would have wanted to 
make a pact with him but you can malce no pact with joy because 
it immediately disappears therefore you cannot capture the devil 
either yes it belongs to his essence that he cannot be captured he 
is stupid if he lets himself be caught and you gain nothing from 
having yet one more stupid devil the devil always seeks to saw 
off the branch on which you sit that is useful and protects you 
from falling asleep and from the vices that go along with it 
the devil is an evil element but joy if you run after it you 
see that joy also has evil in it since then you arrive at pleasure and 
from pleasure go straight to hell your own particular hell which 
turns out differently for everyone  
through my coming to terms with the devil he accepted 
some of my seriousness and i accepted some of his joy this gave the castle in the forest i  
me courage but if the devil has gotten more earnest one must 
brace oneselfl it is always a risky thing to accept joy but it leads 
us to life and its disappointment from which the wholeness of 
our life becomes 
the castle in the f orestl 
cap ii 
hi  win the second night thereafter i am walking alone 
in a dark forest and i notice that i have lost my way i am on a 
dark cart track and stumble through the darkness i finally come to 
quiet dark swamp water and a small old castle stands at its center 
i think it would be good to ask here for the nights lodgings i 
knock on the door i wait a long time it begins to rain i have 
to knock again now i hear someone coming the door opens a 
man in an old fashioned garment a servant asks what i want i ask 
about lodgings for the night and he lets me enter a dark vestibule 
then he leads me up an old wornout stairway at the top i come 
to a wider and higher halllike space with white walls lined with 
black chests and wardrobes 
i am led into a kind of reception room it is a simple space 
with old upholstered furniture the dim light of an antiquated 
lamp lights the room only very meagerly the servant knocks on a 
side door and then quietly opens it i scan it swiftly its a scholars 
study with bookshelves on all four walls and a large writing desk 
at which an old man sits wearing a long black robe he beckons 
me to draw closer the air in the room is heavy and the old man 
seems careworn he is not without dignityhe seems to be one 
of those who have as much dignity as ne can be granted he has 
that modestfearful look of scholarly men who have long since 
been squashed to nothing by the abundance of knowledge i think 
that he is a real  scholar who has learned great modesty before 
the immensity of knowledge and has given himself tirelessly 
to the material of science and research anxiously and equably 
appraising as if he personally had to represent the working out 
of scientific truth 
he greets me embarrassed as if absent and defensive i do not 
wonder about this since i look like an ordinary person only with 
difficulty can he turn his gaze away from his work i repeat my 
request for lodgings for the night after a longer pause the old man 
remarks so you want to sleep then please yourself i notice that 
he is absentminded and therefore ask him to instruct the servant 
to show me a chamber to this he says you are demanding wait 
i cannot just drop everything he sinks again into his book i wait 
patiently mtera while he looks up astonished what do you want 
here ohforgive mei totally forgot that you are waiting here 
ill call the servant straightaway the servant comes and leads me 
to a small chamber on the same floor with bare white walls and a 
large bed he wishes me good night and withdraws 
as i am tired i undress immediately and go to bed after i 
have snuffed out the candle the sheet is uncommonly rough and 
the pillow hard my errant way has led me to a strange place a 
small old castle whose scholarly owner is apparently spending the 
evening of his life alone with his books no one else seems to be 
living in the house apart from the servant who lives over there 
 the drqft continues every attentive person knows their hell but not all know their devil there are not only joyful devils but also sad ones p  
 the drqft continues on a later adventure i discovered how seriousness suits the devil while seriousness certainly makes him more dangerous for you it doesnt agree 
with him believe me pp  
 the drqft continues with this newly gained joy i took off on adventures without knowing where the way would lead i could have known however that the devil 
always tempts us first through women while i might have had clever thoughts as a thinker it was not so in life there i was even fatuous and prejudiced and so quite 
ready to be caught in a fox trap p

  i liber secundus  
in the tower an ideal though solitary existence i think this life 
of the old man with his books and here my thoughts linger for 
a long time until i finally notice that another thought doesnt 
let go of me namely that the old man has hidden his beautiful 
daughter herea vulgar idea for a novelan insipid wornout 
themebut the romantic can be felt in every limba real novelistic 
ideaa castle in a forestsolitary nightan old man petrified 
in his books protecting a costly treasure and enviously hiding it 
from all the worldwhat ridiculous thoughts come to me is it 
hell or purgatory that i must also contrive such childish dreams 
on my wanderings but i feel impotent to elevate my thoughts 
to something a bit stronger or more beautiful i suppose i must 
allow these thoughts to come what good would it do to push 
them awaythey will come againbetter to swallow this stale 
drink than keep it in the mouth so what does this boring heroine 
look like surely blonde paleblue eyeshoping longingly that 
every lost wanderer is her savior from the paternal prison  h i 
know this hackneyed nonsense id rather sleepwhy the devil 
must i plague myself with such empty fantasies 
sleep does not come i toss and turnsleep still does not 
comemust i finally harbor this unsaved soul in myself and is 
it this that will not letme sleep have i such a novelistic soul 
thats all i neededthis would be agonizingly ridiculous 
does this bitterest of all drinks never end it must already 
be midnightand still sleep does not come what in the wide 
world then wont let me sleep is it something to do with this 
chamber is the bed bewitched its terrible what sleeplessness 
can drive a man toeven the most absurd and superstitious 
theories it seems to be cool im freezingperhaps thats what 
keeps me from sleepingits really uncanny hereheaven knows 
what goes on herewerent those steps just now no that must 
have been outside i roll over firmly closing my eyes i simply 
must sleep wasnt that the door just now my god someone 
is standing there am i seeing straighta slim girl pale as 
death standing at the door for heavens sake what is this shes 
coming nearer 
have you come at last she asks quietly impossiblethis is a 
cruel mistakethe novel wants to become realdoes it want to 
grow into some silly ghost story to what nonsense am i damned 
is it my soul that harbors such novelistic brilliance must this 
too happen to me i am truly in hellthe worst awalcening after 
death to be resurrected in a lending library have i held the men 
of my time and their taste in such contempt that i must live in 
hell and write out the novels that i have already spat on long ago 
does the lower half of average human taste also claim holiness 
and invulnerability so that we might not say any bad word  about 
it without having to atone for the sin in hell 
she says oh so you too think me common do you too let 
yourself be deluded by the wretched delusion that i belong in a 
novel you as well whom i hoped had thrown off appearances 
and striven after the essence of things 
i forgive me but are you real its the sorriest likeness to those 
foolishly threadbare scenes in novels for me to assume that you 
are not simply some unfortunate product of my sleepless brain is 
my doubt then truly confirmed by a situation that conforms so 
thoroughly with a sentimental romance 
she you wretch how can you doubt that i am real she falls to her knees at the foot of my bed sobbing and 
holding her face in her hands my god in the end is she really real 
and do i do her an injustice my pity awalcens 
i but for heavens salce tell me one thing in all earnestness 
must i assume that you are real 
she weeps and does not answer 
i who are you then 
she i am the old mans daughter he holds me here in 
unbearable captivity not out of envy or hate but out of love since 
i am his only child and the image of my mother who died young 
i scratch my head is this not some hellish banality word for 
word pulp fiction from the lending library oh you gods where 
have you led me its enough to make one laugh its enough 
to malce one weepto be a beautiful sufferer a tragic shattered 
person is difficult but to become an ape you beautiful and great 
ones to you the banal and eternally ridiculous the unutterably 
hackneyed and emptied out is never set like a gift of heaven in 
uplifted praying hands 
but still she lies there cryingyet what if she were real then 
she would be worth feeling sorry for every man would have 
compassion for her if she is a decent girl what must it have cost 
her to enter into the room of a strange man and to overcome her 
shame in this way 
i my dear child i believe you despite everything that you 
are real what can i do for you 
she finally finally a word from a human mouth 
she gets up her face beaming she is beautiful a deep purity 
rests in her look she has a beautiful and unworldly soul one 
that wants to come into the life of reality to all reality worthy

for me you spoke the redeeming word when you no longer placed 
the banal between you and me know then i was bewitched by 
the banal 
i woe is me you now become very fairytalelike 
she be reasonable dear friend and do not stumble now 
over the fabulous since the fairy tale is the great mother of the 
novel and has even more universal validity than the mostavidly 
read novel of your time and you know that what has been 
on everyones lips for millennia though repeated endlessly still 
comes nearest the ultimate human truth so do not let the fabulous 
come between us 
i you are clever and do not seem to have inherited the wisdom 
of your father but tell me what do you thinlc of the divinity of 
the socalled ultimate truths i found it very strange to seek them in 
banality according to their nature they must be quite uncommon 
think only of our great philosophers 
she the more uncommon these highest truths are the more 
inhuman must they be and the less they speak to you as something 
valuable or meaningful concerning human essence and being 
only what is human and what you call banal and hackneyed  
contains the wisdom that you seek the fabulous does not speak 
against me but for me and proves how universally human i am 
and how much i too not only need redempion but also deserve

it for i can live in the world of reality as well or better than many 
others of my sex 
i strange maiden you are bewilderingwhen i saw your 
father i hoped he would invite me to a scholarly conversation 
he did not and i was aggrieved at him because of this since his 
distracted slackness hurt my dignity but with you i find it much 
better you give me matters to ponder you are uncommon 
she you are mistaken i am very common 
i i cant believe that how beautiful and worthy of adoration 
is the expression of your soul in your eyes happy and enviable is 
the man who will free you 
she do you love mer 
 by god i love youbutunfortunately i am already 
married 
she soyou see even banal reality is a redeemer i thank you 
dear friend and i bring you greetings from salome 
with these words her shape dissolves into darkness dim 
moonlight penetrates the room where she stood something 
shadowy liesit is a profusion of red roses 
  if no outer adventure happens to you then no inner 
adventure happens to you either the part that you take over 
from the deviljoy that isleads you into adventure in this way 
you will find your lower as well as your upper limits it is necessary 
for you to know your limits if you do not know them you run 
into the artificial barriers of your imagination and the expectations 
of your fellow men but your life will not take kindly to being 
hemmed in by artificial barriers life wants to jump over such 
barriers and you will fallout with yourself these barriers are not 
your real limits but arbitrary limitations that do unnecessary 
violence to you therefore try to find your real limits one never 
knows them in advance but one sees and understands them only 
when one reaches them and this happens to you only if you have 
balance without balance you transgress your limits without noticing 
what has happened to you you achieve balance however only if you 
nurture your opposite but that is hateful to you in your innermost 
core because it is not heroic 
my spirit reflected on everything rare and uncommon it pried 
its way into unfound possibilities toward paths that lead into the 
hidden toward lights that shine in the night and as my spirit did 
this everything ordinary in me suffered harm without my noticing 
it and it began to hanker after life since i did not live it hence 
this adventure i was smitten by the romantic the romantic is a 
step backward to reach the way one must sometimes also take a 
few steps backward  
in the adventure i experienced what i had witnessed in the 
mysterium what i saw there as salome and elijah became in life 
the old scholar and his pale lockedup daughter what i live is a 
distorted likeness of the mysterium following the romantic way 
i reached the awkwardness and ordinariness of life where i run 
out of thoughts and almost forget myself what i formerly loved the castle in the forest i  
i must now experience as feeble and wasted and what i formerly 
derided i had to envy as towering and helplessly crave i accepted 
the absurdity of this adventure no sooner had this happened 
than i also saw how the maiden transformed herself and signified 
an autonomous meaning one inquires into the desire of the 
ridiculous and that is enough for it to change 
what about masculinity do you know how much femininity 
man lacks for completenessr do you know how much masculinity 
woman lacks for completenessr you seek the feminine in women 
and the masculine in men and thus there are always only men 
and women but where are peopler you man should not seek 
the feminine in women but seek and recognize it in yourself as 
you  possess it from the beginning it pleases you however to 
play at manliness because it travels on a wellworn track you 
woman should not seek the masculine in men but assume the 
masculine in yourself since you possess it from the beginning but 
it amuses you and is easy to play at femininity consequently man 
despises you because he despises his femininity but humankind is 
masculine and feminine not just man or woman you can hardly 
say of your soul what sex it is but if you pay close attention you 
will see that the most masculine man has a feminine soul and the 
most feminine woman has a masculine soul the more manly you 
are the more remote from you is what woman really is since the 
feminine in yourself is alien and contemptuous 
if you take a piece of joy from the devil and set off on 
adventures with it you accept your pleasure but pleasure 
immediately attracts everything you desire and then you 
must decide whether your pleasure spoils or enhances you if 
you are of the devil you will grope in blind desire after the 
manifold and it will lead you astray but if you remain with 
yourself as a man who is himself and not of the devil then 
you will remember your humanity you will not behave toward 
women per se as a man but as a human being that is to say as 
if you were of the same sex as her you will recall your femininity 
it may seem to you then as if you were unmanly stupid and 
feminine so to speak but you must accept the ridiculous 
otherwise you will suffer distress and there will come a time 
when you are least observant when it will suddenly round on 
you and make you ridiculous it is bitter for the most masculine 
man to accept his femininity since it appears ridiculous to him 
powerless and tawdry 
yes it seems as if you have lost all virtue as if you have fallen 
into debasement it seems the same way to the woman who 
accepts her masculinity yes it seems to you like enslavement 
you are a slave of what you need in your soul the most masculine 
man needs women and he is consequently their slave become a 
woman yourself and you will be saved from slavery to woman 
you are abandoned without mercy to woman so long as you 
cannot fend off mockery with all your masculinity it is good for 
you once to put on womens clothes people will laugh at you but 
through becoming a woman you attain freedom from women and 
 in on the psychological aspects of the kore figure  jung described this episode as follows a lonely house in a wood where an old scholar is living suddenly his 
daughter appears a kind of ghost complaining that people always only consider her as a fantasy cw  i i jung commented following his remarks concerning the 
elijah and salome episode above note  p  dream iii presents the same theme but on a more fairy talelike plane the anima is here characterized as a ghostly 
being ibid  
 the drqft continues my friend you learn nothing about my outer visible life you only hear about my inner life the counterpart of my outer life if you therefore think 
that i have but my inner life and that is my only life then you are mistaken for you must know that your inner life does not become richer at the expense of your outer 
one but poorer if you do not live on the outside you will not become richer within but merely more burdened this is not to your advantage and it is the beginning of 
evil likewise your outer life will not become richer and more beautiful at the expense of your inner one but only poorer and poorer balance finds the way p  
 the drqft continues i returned to my middle ages where i was still romantic and there i experienced the adventure p  
 in  in psychological types jung wrote a very feminine woman has a masculine soul and a very masculine man has a feminine soul the contrast is due to the 
fact that for example a man is not in all things wholly masculine but also normally has certain feminine traits the more masculine his outer attitude is the more his 
feminine traits are obliterated instead they appear in the unconscious cw   he designated the mans feminine soul as the anima and the womans 
masculine soul as the animus and described how individuals projected their soul images onto members of the opposite sex   
 for jung the integration of the anima for the man and of the animus for the woman was necessary for the development of the personality in  he described this 
process which required withdrawing the projections from members of the opposite sex differentiating from them and becoming conscious of them in the relations 
between the i and the unconscious part  ch  cw  f see also aion  cw  ff  
 instead of this phrase the corrected drqft has but if he accepts the feminine in himself he frees himself from slavery to woman p

 i liber secundus  
their tyranny the acceptance of femininity leads to completion 
the same is valid for the woman who accepts her masculinity 
the feminine in men is bound up with evil i find it on the 
way of desire the masculine in the woman is bound up with 
evil therefore people hate to accept their own other but if you 
accept it that which is connected with the perfection of men comes 
to pass namely that when you become the one who is mocked 
the white bird of the soul comes flying it was far away but your 
humiliation attracted it the mystery draws near to you and 
things happen around you like miracles a gold luster shines since 
the sun has risen from its grave as a man you have no soul since it 
is in the woman as a woman you have no soul since it is in the man 
but if you become a human being then your soul comes to you 
if you remain within arbitrary and artificially created 
boundaries you will walk as between two high walls you do 
not see the immensity of the world but if you break down the 
walls that confine your view and if the immensity and its endless 
uncertainty inspire you with fear then the ancient sleeper awak
ens in you whose messenger is the white bird then you need the 
message of the old tamer of chaos there in the whirl of chaos 
dwells eternal wonder your world begins to become wonderful 
man belongs not only to an ordered world he also belongs in 
the wonderworld of his soul consequently you must make your 
ordered world horrible so that you are put off by being too much 
outside yourself 
your soul is in great need because drought weighs on its 
world if you look outside yourselves you see the faroff forest 
and mountains and above them your vision climbs to the realms 
of the stars and if you look into yourselves you will see on the 
other hand the nearby as faroff and infinite since the world 
of the inner is as infinite as the world of the outer just as you 
become a part of the manifold essence of the world through your 
bodies so you become a part of the manifold essence of the inner 
world through your soul this inner world is truly infinite in no 
way poorer than the outer one man lives in two worlds a fool 
lives here or there but never here and there 
 perhaps you think that a man who consecrates his life to 
research leads a spiritual life and that his soul lives in  larger 
measure than anyone elses but such a life is also external just 
as external as the life of a man who lives for outer things to be 
sure such a scholar does not live for outer things but for outer 
thoughtsnot for himsel but for his object if you say of a man 
that he has totally lost himself to the outer and wasted his years 
in excess you must also say the same of this old man he has 
thrown himself away in all the books and thoughts of others 
consequently his soul is in great need it must humiliate itself and 
run into every strangers room to beg for the recognition that he 
fails to give her 
therefore you see those old scholars running after recognition 
in a ridiculous and undignified manner they are offended if their 
name is not mentioned cast down if another one says the same 
thing in a better way irreconcilable if someone alters theirs views 
in the least go to the meetings of scholars and you will see them 
these lamentable old men with their great merits and their starved souls famished for recognition and their thirst which can never be 
slaked the soul demands your folly not your wisdom 
therefore because i rise above gendered masculinity and yet 
do not exceed the human the feminine that is contemptible to 
me transforms itself into a meaningful being this is the most 
difficult thingto be beyond the gendered and yet remain within 
the human if you rise above the gendered with the help of a 
general rule you become the same as that rule and overreach the 
human therefore you become dry hard and inhuman 
you may go past the gendered for human reasons and never 
for the sake of a general rule that remains the same in the most 
diverse situations and therefore never has a perfect validity for 
each single situation if you act from your humanity you act from 
that particular situation without general principle with only what 
corresponds to the situation thus you do justice to the situation 
perhaps at the expense of a general rule that should not be too 
painful for you because you are not the rule there is something 
else that is human something all too human and whoever has 
ended up there will do well to remember the blessing of the 
general rule for the general rule also has meaning and has not 
been set up for fun it comprises much venerable work of the 
human spirit such persons are not capable of a general principle 
above the gendered but only their imagination is capable of what 
they have lost they have become their own imagination and 
arbitrariness to their own detriment they need to remember the 
gendered so that they wake from their dreams to reality 
it is as agonizing as a sleepless night to fulfill the beyond 
from the here and now namely the other and the opposing in 
myself it sneaks up like a fever like a poisonous fog and when 
your senses are excited and stretched to the utmost the daimonic 
comes as something so insipid and worn out so mild and stale 
that it makes you sick here you would gladly stop feeling across 
to your beyond startled and disgusted you long for the return of 
the supernal beauties of your visible world you spit out and curse 
everything that lies beyond your lovely world since you lmow 
that it is the disgust scum refuse of the human animal who stuffs 
himself in dark places creeps along sidewalks sniffs out every 
blessed angle and from the cradle to the grave enjoys only what 
has already been on everyones lips 
but here you may not stopdo not place your disgust between 
your hereandnow and your beyond the way to your beyond 
leads through hell and in fact through your own wholly particular 
hell whose bottom consists of kneedeep rubble whose air is the 
spent breath of millions whose fires are dwarflike passions and 
whose devils are chimerical signboards 
everything odious and disgusting is your own particular hell 
how can it be otherwise every other hell was at least worth 
seeing or full of fun but that is never hell your hell is made 
up of all the things that you always ejected from your sanctuary 
with a curse and a kick of the foot when you step into your 
own hell never think that you come like one suffering in 
beauty or as a proud pariah but you come like a stupid and 
curious fool and gaze in wonder at the scraps that have fallen 
from your table

iiii you really want to rage but you see at the same time how well 
rage suits you your hellish absurdity stretches for miles good 
for you if you can swear you will find that profanity is lifesaving 
thus if you go through hell you should not forget to give due 
attention to whatever crosses your path etly look into everything 
that excites your contempt or rage thereby you accomplish the 
miracle that i experienced with the pale maiden you give soul to 
the soulless and thereby it can come to something out of horrible 
nothingness thus you will redeem your other into life your values 
want to draw you away from what you presently are to get you 
ahead of and beyond yourself your being however pulls you 
to the bottom lilce lead you cannot at the same time live both 
since both exclude each other but on the way you can live both 
therefore the way redeems you you cannot at the same time be

mountain to valley and from valley to mountain much begins

hi ii in the following night i found myself wandering 
once more in a homely snowcovered country a gray evening sky 
covers the sun the air is moist and frosty someone who does not 
look trustworthy has joined me most notably he has only one eye 
and a few scars on his face he is poor and dirtily clothed a tramp 
he has a black stubble beard that has not seen a razor for a long 
time i have a good walking stick for any eventuality its damned 
cold he remarks after a while i agree mter a longer pause he 
asks where are you going 
i im going to the next village where i plan to stay overnight 
he id like to do that too but will hardly manage to get a bed 
i have you no money well let us see are you out of work 
he yes times are bad until a few days ago i was working for 
a locksmith but then he had no more work now im traveling 
and looking for work 
i wouldnt you work for a farmer there is always a shortage 
of farm labor 
he working for a farmer doesnt suit me that means getting 
up early in the morningthe work is hard and wages are low 
i but its always much more beautiful in the country than in 
a town 
he its boring in the country one meets nobody 
 well but there are also villagers 
he but there is no mental stimulation the farmers are clods 
i look at him astonished what he still wants mental stimulation 
better that he honestly earn his keep and when he has done that 
he can think of stimulation i 
i but tell me what kind of mental stimulation is there in 
the city 
he you can go to the cinema in the evenings thats great and 
its cheap you get to see everything that happens in the world 
 in dantes commedia hell has rune levels one of the lowly i  
i have to think of hell where there are also cinemas for those 
who despised this institution on earth and did not go there because 
everyone else found it to their taste 
i what interested you most about the cinema 
he one sees all sorts of stunning feats there was one man 
who ran up houses another carried his head under his arm 
another even stood in the middle of a fire and wasnt burnt yes 
its really remarkable the things that people can do 
and thats what this fellow calls mental stimulation but 
waitthat does seem remarkable didnt the saints also carry 
their heads under their arms didnt saint francis and saint 
ignatius levitateand what about the three men in the fiery 
furnace isnt it a blasphemous idea to consider theacta sanctorum 
as historical cinema oh todays miracles are simply somewhat less 
mythical than technical i regard my companion with feelinghe 
lives the history of the worldand i 
 certainly its very well done did you see anything else 
like this 
he yes i saw how the king of spain was murdered 
i but he wasnt murdered at al 
he well that doesnt matter in that case it was one of those 
damned capitalist icings at least they got one of them if all of 
them were talcen out the people would be free 
not a word more dare i say wilhelm tell a work by friedrich 
schillerthe man is standing right in the thick of it in the stream 
of heroic story one who announces the murder of the tyrant to a 
sleeping people 
we have arrived at the inn a country tavern a reasonably clean 
parlora few men sit with beer in the corner i am recognized as a 
gentleman and led into the better corner where a chequered cloth 
covers the end of a table the other sits down at the far end of the 
table and i decide to have him served a proper evening meal he 
is already loolcing at me full of expectation and hungerwith his 
one eye 
i where did you lose your eye 
he in a braw but i also got my knife into the other fellow 
pretty nicely mter that he got three months they gave me 
six but it was beautiful in prison at the time the building was 
completely new i worked in the locksmiths there wasnt much to 
do and yet there was enough to eat prison really isnt all that bad 
i look around to make sure that no one is listening to me 
talking with a former convict but no one seems to have noticed 
i seem to have ended up in welltodo company are there also 
prisons in hell for those who never saw the inside of one while 
they were alive incidentallymustnt it be a peculiarly beautiful 
feeling to hit bottom in reality at least once where there is no 
going down any further but only upward beckons at best where 
for once one stands before the whole height of reality 
he so after that there i was out on the street since they 
banished me then i went to france it was lovely there 
what demands beauty makes something can be learned from 
this man

  i liber secundus  fi 
he it was over a woman she was carrying his bastard but i 
wanted to marry her she was already due after that she didnt 
want to anymore i havent heard from her 
i how old are you now 
he ill be thirtyfive in spring once i find a proper job 
we can get married right off ill find myself one i will theres 
something wrong with my lungs though but thatll soon get 
better again 
 he has a coughing fit i think that the prospects are not good 
and silently admire the poor devils unswerving optimism 
after dinner i go to bed in a humble room i hear how the 
other settles into his lodging for the night next door he coughs 
several times then he falls still suddenly i awalcen again at an 
uncanny moan and gurgle mixed with a halfstifled cough i listen 
tenselyno doubt its him it sounds like something dangerous 
i jump up and throw something on i open the door of his room 
moonlight floods it the man lies still dressed on a sack of straw 
a dark stream of blood is flowing from his mouth and forming a 
puddle on the floor he moans half choking and coughs out blood 
he wants to get up but sinks back againi hurry to support him 
but i see that the hand of death lies on him he is sullied with 
blood twice over my hands are covered with it a rattling sigh 
escapes from him then every stiffness loosens a gentle shudder 
passes over his limbs and then everything is deathly still 
where am i are there also cases of death in hell for those 
who have never thought about death i look at my bloodstained 
handsas if i were a murderer  is it not the blood of my brother 
that sticks to my hands the moon paints my shadow black on 
the white walls of the chamber what am i doing here why this 
horrible drama i look inquiringly at the moon as a witness how 
does this concern the moon has it not already seen worse has 
it not shone a hundred thousand times into broken eyes this 
is certainly of no avail to its eternal cratersone more or less 
death does it not uncover the terrible deceit of life therefore 
it is probably all the same to the moon whether and how one 
passes away only we kick up a fuss about itwith what right 
what did this one do he worked lazed about laughed drank 
ate slept gave his eye for the woman and for her sake forfeited 
his good name furthermore he lived the human myth after a 
fashion he admired the wonderworkers praised the death of the 
tyrant and vaguely dreamed of the freedom of the people and 
thenthen he miserably diedlike everyone else that is generally 
valid i sat down on the floor what shadows over the earth all 
lights gutter out in final despondency and loneliness death has 
enteredand there is no one left to grieve this is a final truth 
and no riddle what delusion could make usbelieve in riddles 
 we stand on the spiky stones of misery and death 
a destitute joins me and wants admittance into my soul and 
i am thus not destitute enough where was my destitution when 
i did not live it i was a player at life one who thought earnestly 
about life and lived it easily the destitute was far away and 
forgotten life had become difficult and murkier winter kept 
on going and the destitute stood in snow and froze i join myself 
with him since i need him he malces living light and easy he 
leads to the depths to the ground where i can see the heights 
without the depths i do not have the heights i may be on the 
heights but precisely because of that i do not become aware of 
the heights i therefore need the bottommost for my renewal if i 
am always on the heights i wear them out and the best becomes 
atrocious to me but because i do not want to have it my best becomes a horror to 
me because of that i myself become a horror a horror to myself 
and to others and a bad spirit of torment be respectful and lmow 
that your best has become a horror with that you save yourself 
and others from useless torment a man who can no longer climb 
down from his heights is sick and he brings himself and others 
to torment if you have reached your depths then you see your 
height light up brightly over you worthy of desire and faroff 
as if unreachable since secretly you would prefer not to reach it 
since it seems unattainable to you for you also love to praise your 
heights when you are low and to tell yourself that you would have 
only left them with pain and that you did not live so long as you 
missed them it is a good thing that you have almost become the 
other nature that malces you speak this way but at bottom you 
know that it is not quite true 
at your low point you are no longer distinct from your fellow 
beings you are not ashamed and do not regret it since insofar as 
you live the life of your fello beings and descend to their lowliness 
 you also climb into the holy stream of common life where you 
are no longer an individual on a high mountain but a fish among 
fish a frog among frogs 
your heights are your own mountain which belongs to you 
and you alone there you are individual and live your very own 
life if you live your own life you do not live the common life 
which is always continuing and neverending the life of history 
and the inalienable and everpresent burdens and products of the 
human race there you live the endlessness of being but not the 
becoming becoming belongs to the heights and is full of torment 
how can you become if you never are therefore you need your 
bottommost since there you are but therefore you also need 
your heights since there you become 
if you live the common life at your lowest reaches then you 
become aware of your self if you are on your heights then you 
are your best and you become aware only of your best but not 
that which you are in the general life as a being what one is 
as one who becomes no one knows but on the heights 
imagination is at its strongest for we imagine that we know 
what we are as developing beings and even more so the less 
we want to know what we are as beings because of that we do 
not love the condition of our being brought low although or 
rather precisely because only there do we attain clear knowledge 
of ourselves 
everything is riddlesome to one who is becoming but not to 
one who is he who suffers from riddles should take thought of 
his lowest condition we solve those riddles from which we suffer 
but not those which please us 
to be that which you are is the bath of rebirth in the depths 
being is not an unconditional persistence but an endlessly slow 
growth you think you are standing still like swamp water but 
slowly you flow into the sea that covers the earths greatest deeps 
and is so vast that firm land seems only an island imbedded in the 
womb of the immeasurable sea 
as a drop in the ocean you take part in the current ebb and 
flow you swell slowly on the land and slowly sink back again in 
interminably slow breaths you wander vast distances in blurred 
currents and wash up on strange shores not knowing how you 
got there you mount the billows of huge storms and are swept 
back again into the depths and you do not know how this 
happens to you you had thought that your movement came from 
you and that it needed your decisions and efforts so that you could 
get going and make progress but with every conceivable effort you

would never have achieved that movement and reached those areas 
to which the sea and the great wind of the world brought you 
from endless blue plains you sink into black depths luminous 
fish draw you marvelous branches twine around you from above 
you slip through columns and twisting wavering darkleaved 
plants and the sea takes you up again in bright green water 
to white sandy coasts and a wave foams you ashore and swallows 
you back again and a wide smooth swell lifts you softly and 
leads you again to new regions to twisting plants to slowly 
creeping slimy polyps and to green water and white sand and 
breaking surf 
but from far off your heights shine to you above the sea in 
a golden light like the moon emerging from the tide and you 
become aware of yourself from afar and longing seizes you and 
the will for your own movement you want to cross over from 
being to becoming since you have recognized the breath of the 
sea and its flowing that leads you here and there without your 
ever adhering you have also recognized its surge that bears you to 
alien shores and carries you back and gargles you up and down 
you saw that it was the life of the whole and the death of each 
individual you felt yourself entwined in the collective death 
from death to the earths deepest place from death in your own 
strangely breathing depths ohyou long to be beyond despair 
and mortal fear seize you in this death that breathes slowly and 
streams back and forth eternally all this light and dark warm 
tepid and cold water all these wavy swaying twisting plantlike 
animals and bestial plants all these nightly wonders become a 
horror to you and you long for the sun for light dry air for firm 
stones for a fixed place and straight lines for the motionless and 
firmly held for rules and preconceived purpose for  singleness 
and your own intent 
the knowledge of death came to me that night from the dying 
that engulfs the world i saw how we live toward death how the 
swaying golden wheat sinks together under the scythe of the 
reaper  like a smooth wave on the seabeach he who abides in 
common life becomes aware of death with fear thus the fear of 
death drives him toward singleness he does not live there but 
he becomes aware of life and is happy since in singleness he is 
one who becomes and has overcome death he overcomes death 
through overcoming common life he does not live his individual 
being since he is not what he is but what he becomes 
one who becomes grows aware of life whereas one who 
simply exists never will since he is in the midst of life he needs 
the heights and singleness to become aware of life but in life he 
becomes aware of death and it is good that you become aware 
of collective death since then you know why your singleness 
and your heights are good your heights are like the moon that 
luminously wanders alone and through the night looks eternally 
clear sometimes it covers itself and then you are totally in the 
darkness of the earth but time and again it fills itself out with the anchorite i  
light the death of the earth is foreign to it motionless and clear 
it sees the life of the earth from afar without enveloping haze 
and streaming oceans its unchanging form has been solid from 
eternity it is the solitary clear light of the night the individual 
being and the near fragment of eternity 
from there you look out cold motionless and radiating with 
otherworldly silvery light and green twilights you pour out into 
the distant horror you see it but your gaze is clear and cold your 
hands are red from living blood but the moonlight of your gaze is 
motionless it is the life blood of your brother yes it is your own 
blood but your gaze remains luminous and embraces the entire 
horror and the earths round your gaze rests on silvery seas on 
snowy peaks on blue valleys and you do not hear the groaning 
and howling of the human animal 
the moon is dead your soul went to the moon to the preserver 
of soulso thus the soul moved toward deathy i went into the 
inner death and saw that outer dying is better than inner death 
and i decided to die outside and to live within for that reason i 
turned awa and sought the place of the inner life 
the anchorite 
cap iv dies  
hi ij on the following night i found myself on new paths 
hot dry air flowed around me and i saw the desert yellow sand 
all around heaped up in waves a terrible irascible sun a sky as 
blue as tarnished steel the air shimmering above the earth on my 
right side a deeply cut valley with a dry river bed some languid 
grass and dusty brambles in the sand i see the tracks of naked 
feet that lead up from the rocky valley to the plateau i follow 
them along a high dune where it falls off the tracks move off 
to the other side they appear to be fresh and old halfwornaway 
footprints run alongside i pursue them attentively again they 
follow the slope of the dune now they flow into another set of 
footprintsbut it is the same  set that i have already followed 
the one ascending from the valley 
henceforth i follow the footprints downward in astonishment 
i soon reach the hot red rocks corroded by the wind on the 
stone the footprints are lost but i see where the rock falls off 
in layers and i climb down the air glows and the rock burns 
my soles now i have reached the bottom there are the tracks 
again they lead along the winding of the valley a short distance 
suddenly i stand before a small hut covered in reeds and made 
of mud bricks a rickety wooden plank forms the door where a 
cross has been painted in red i open it quietly a haggard man 
covered in a white linen mantle is sitting on a mat with his back 
leaning against the wall across his knees lies a book in yellow 
parchment with beautiful black handwritinga greek gospel 
without doubt i am with an anchorite of the libyan desert 
 in traniformations and symbols of the libido ii jung cited beliefs in different cultures that the moon was the gathering place of departed souls cw b  
in mysterium coniunctionis i jung commented on this motif in alchemy cw i i 
i the draft continues i accepted the rogue and lived and died with him since i lived him i became his murderer since we kill what we live p i 
 the corrected drcift continues from death p  
 first day the handwritten draft has fourth adventure first day p  the corrected draft has dies i evening p i 
 december  iiin black book  jung noted all kinds of things lead me far away from my scientific endeavor which i thought i had subscribed to firmly i wanted 
to serve humanity through it and now my soul you lead me to these new things yes it is the inbetween world the pathless the manifolddazzling i forgotthat i had 
reached a new world which had been alien to me previously i see neither way nor path what i believed about the soul has to become true here namely that she knows 
her own way better and that no intention can prescribe her a better one i feel that a large chunk of science has been broken off i suppose it must be like this for the sake 
of the soul and her life i find the thought that this must occur only for me agonizing and that perhaps no one will gain insight from my work but my soul demands this 
achievement i should be able to do this just for myself without hopefor thesake of god this is truly a hard way but what else did those anchorites of the first centuries 
of christianity do and were they the worst or least capable of those living at the end hardly since they came to the most relentless conclusions with regard to the psy
chological necessity of their time they left wife and child wealth glory and scienceand turned toward the desertfor gods sake so be it pp i 
 in the next chapter the anchorite is identified as ammonius in a letter of december i ii jung noted that the anchorite came from the third century jfa 
there are three historical figures named ammonius in alexandria from this period ammonius a christian philosopher in the third century once thought to have been 
responsible for the medieval divisions of the gospels ammonius cetus who was born a christian but turned to greek philosophy and whose work presents a transition 
from platonism to neoplatonism a neoplatonic ammonius in the fifth century who tried to reconcile aristotle and the bible at alexandria there was accommodation 
between neoplatonism and christianity and some of the pupils of the latter ammonius converted to christianity

 i liber secundus  
i am i disturbing you father 
a you do not disturb me but do not call me father i am a man 
like you what is your desire 
i i come without desire i have come to this place in the 
desert by chance and found tracks in the sand up there that led 
me in a circle to you 
a you found the tracks of my daily walks at daybreak 
and sunset 
i excuse me if i interrupt your devotion it is a rare opportunity 
for me to be with you i have never before seen an anchorite 
a there are several others whom you can see further down 
in this valley some have huts like me others live in the graves that 
the ancients have hollowed out in these rocks i live uppermost in 
the valley because it is most solitary and quiet here and because 
here i am closest to the peace of the desert 
i have you already been here long 
a i have lived here for perhaps ten years but really i can no 
longer remember exactly how long it is it could also be a few more 
years time passes so quickly 
i time passes quickly how is that possible your life ltiust 
be frightfully monotonous 
a time certainly passes quickly for me much too quickly 
even it seems you are a pagan 
i me nonot exactly i was raised in the christian faith 
a well then how can you ask whether time drags on for me 
you must know what preoccupies a man who is grieving only 
idlers grow bored 
i again forgive me my curiosity is great what then do you 
occupy yourself with 
a are you a child to begin with you see that i am reading 
and than i keep regular hours 
i but i can see nothing at all with which you could occupy 
yourself here you must have read this book from cover to cover 
often enough and if it is the gospels as i suppose then i am sure 
you already know them by heart 
a how childishly you speak surely you know that one can 
read a book many timesperhaps you almost know it by heart and 
nevertheless it can be that when you look again at the lines before 
you certain things appear new or even new thoughts occur to you 
that you did not have before every word can work productively in 
your spirit and finally if you have once left the book for a week 
and you take it up again after your spirit has experienced various 
different changes then a number of things will dawn on you 
i i have difficulty grasping this the book remains one and 
the same certainly a wonderfully profound yes even divine matter 
but surely not rich enough to fill countless years 
a you are astonishing how then do you read this holy book 
do you really always see only one and the same meaning in it 
where do you come from you are truly a pagan 
i i beg you please dont hold it against me if i read like a 
pagan let me talk with you i am here to learn from you consider 
me as an ignorant student which i am in these matters 
a if i call you a pagan dont take it as an insult i used to be a 
pagan too exactly like you as i  well remember therefore how 
can i blame you for your ignorance i thank you for your patience but it matters very much to 
me to know how you read and what you take from this book 
a your question is not easy to answer its easier to explain 
colors to a blind person you must know one thing above all a 
succession of words does not have only one meaning but men 
strive to assign only a single meaning to the sequence of words 
in order to have an unambiguous language this striving is 
worldly and constricted and belongs to the deepest layers of 
the divine creative plan on the higher levels of insight into 
divine thoughts you recognize that the sequence of words has 
more than one valid meaning only to the allknowing is it given 
to know all the meanings of the sequence of words increasingly 
we try to grasp a few more meanings 
i if i understand you correctly you think that the holy writings 
of the new testament also have a doubleness an exoteric and an 
esoteric meaning as a few jewish scholars contend concerning 
their holy books 
a this bad superstition is far from me i observe that you are 
wholly inexperienced in divine matters 
i i must confess my deep ignorance about these things but 
i am eager to experience and understand what you think about 
the multifaceted meaning of the sequence of words 
a unfortunately i am in no position to tell you everything i 
know about it but at least i will try to make the elements clear to 
you because of your ignorance i will therefore begin elsewhere this 
time what you need to know is that before i became acquainted 
with christianity i was a rhetorician and philosopher in the city 
of alexandria i had a great throng of students including many 
romans a few barbarians and also some gauls and britons i 
taught them not only the history of greek philosophy but also 
the new systems among them the system of philo whom we call 
the jew he was a clever head but fantastically abstract as the 
jews are wont to be when they devise systems moreover he was 
a slave of his own words i added my own and wove an atrocious 
web of words in which i ensnared not only my listeners but also 
myself we rioted terribly among words and names our own 
miserable creatures and accorded divine potency to them yes we 
even believed in their reality and believed that we possessed the 
divine and had committed it to words 
i but philo judeaus if this is who you mean was a serious 
philosopher and a great thinker even john the evangelist included 
some of philos thoughts in the gospe 
a you are right it is to philos credit that he furnished 
language like so many other philosophers he belongs to the 
language artists but words should not become gods 
i i fail to understand you here does it not say in the gospel 
according to john god was the word it appears to make quite 
explicit the point which you have just now rejected 
a guard against being a slave to words here is the gospel 
read from that passage where it says in him was the life what 
does john say there 
i and life was the light of men and the light shines in the 
darkness and the darkness has not understood it but it became 
a person sent from god by the name of john who came as a 
witness and to be a witness of the light the genuine light which 
 philo judeaus also called philo of alexandria  bce ce was a greekspeaking jewish philosopher his works presented a fusion of greek philosophy and 
judaism for philo god to whom he referred by the platonic term to on the one was transcendent and unknowable certain powers reached down from god 
to the world the facet of god knowable through reason is the divine logos there has been much debate on the precise relation between philos concept of the 
logos and johns gospel on june   jung wrote to james kirsch the gnosis from which john the evangelist emanated is definitely jewish but its essence is 
hellenistic in the style of philo judaeus the founder of the teachings of the logos j a 
 in  jung wrote until now it has not truly and fundamentally been noted that our time despite the prevalence of irreligiosity is so to speak congenitally charged with 
the attainment of the christian epoch namely with the supremacy of the word that logos which the central figure of christian faith represents the word has literally 
become our god and has remained so present and future cw   
 john  in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god the same was in the beginning with god all things were made 
by him and without him was not any thing made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness 
comprehended it not there was a man sent from god whose name was john the same came for a witness to bear witness of the light that all men through him

 illuminates each person came into the world he was in the 
world and the world became through him and the world did not 
recognize him that is what i read here but what do you make 
of this 
a i ask you was this aorol logos a concept a word it 
was a light indeed a man and lived among men you see philo 
only lent john the word so that john would have at his disposal 
the word aorol alongside the word light to describe the son 
of man john gave to living men the meaning of the aorol but 
philo gave aorol as the dead concept that usurped life even the 
divine life through this the dead does not gain life and the 
living is killed and this was also my atrocious error 
i i see what you mean this thought is new to me and seems 
worth consideration until now it always seemed to me  as if it 
were exactly that which was meaningful in john namely that the 
son of man is the aorol in that he thus elevates the lower to the 
higher spirit to the world of the aorol but you lead me to see 
the matter conversely namely that john brings the meaning of 
the aorol down to man 
a i learned to see that john has in fact even done the great 
service of having brought the meaning of the aorol up to man 
i you have peculiar insights that stretch my curiosity to the 
utmost how is that do you think that the human stands higher 
than the aorol 
a i want to answer this question within the scope of your 
understanding if the human god had not become important 
above everything he would not have appeared as the son in the 
flesh but in the aorol 
i that makes sense to me but i confess that this view is 
surprising to me it is especially astonishing to me that you a 
christian anchorite have come to such views i would not have 
expected this of you 
a as i have already noticed you have a completely false idea 
of me and my essence let me give you a small example of my 
preoccupation ive spent many years alone with the process of 
unlearning have you ever unlearned anything well then you 
should know how long it takes and i was a successful teacher 
as you know for such people to unlearn is difficult or even 
impossible but i see that the sun has gone down soon it will be 
completely dark night is the time of silence i want to show you 
your place for the night i need the morning for my work but 
after midday you can come to me again if you like then we will 
continue our conversation 
he leads me out of the hut the valley is covered in blue shadows 
the first stars are already glittering in the sky he leads me around 
the corner of a rock we are standing at the entrance of a grave 
cut into the stone we step in not far from the entrance lies a heap 
of reeds covered with mats next to it there is a pitcher of water 
and on a white cloth there are dried dates and black bread 
a here is your place and your supper sleep well and do not 
forget your morning prayer when the sun rises 
 the solitary lives in endless desert full of awesome 
beauty he looks at the whole and at inner meaning he loathes 
manifold diversity if it is near him he looks at it from afar in its 
totality consequently silvery splendor and joy and beauty cloale 
diversity for him what is near him must be simple and innocent 
since close at hand the manifold and complicated tear and break the anchorite i  
through the silvery splendor no cloudiness of the sky no haze 
or mist is allowed to be around him otherwise he cannot look 
at the distant manifold in the whole consequently the solitary 
loves the desert above all where everything nearby is simple and 
nothing turbid or blurred lies between him and the faraway 
the life of the solitary would be cold were it not for the immense sun 
which makes the air and rocks glow the sun and its eternal splendor replace 
for the solitary his own life warmth 
h is heart longs for the sun 
ii e wanders to the lands of the sun 
he dreams of the fickering splendor of the sun of the hot red stones spread 
out at midday of the golden hot rays of dry sand  
the solitary seeks the sun and no one else is so ready to open his heart as he is 
therefore he loves the desert above all since he loves its deep stillness 
he needs little food since the sun and its glow nourish him consequently 
the solitary loves the desert above all since it is a mother to him giving him 
food and invigorating warmth at regular hours 
i n the desert the solitary is relieved of care and therefore turns his whole 
life to the sprouting garden ofhis soul which can jfourish only under a hot 
sun in his garden the delicious red fruit grows that bears swelling sweetness 
under a tight skin 
you think that the solitary is poor you do not see that he strolls under 
laden fruit trees and that his hand touches grain a hundredfold under dark 
leaves the oveifull reddish blossoms swell toward him from abundant buds 
and the fruit almost bursts with thronging juices fragrant resins drip from 
his trees and under his fiet thrusting seed breaks open 
if the sun sinks onto the plane of the sea like an exhausted bird the solitary 
envelops himself and holds his breath he does not move and is pure expectancy 
until the miracle of the renewal of light rises in the east 
brimful delicious expectation is in the solitary  
the horror of the desert and of withered evaporation surround him and 
you do not understand how the solitary can live  
but his eye rests on the garden and his ears listen to the source and his 
hand touches velvet leaves and fruit and his breath draws in sweet peifumes 
from blossomrich trees 
he cannot tell you since the splendor of his garden is so abundant he 
stammers when he speaks of it and he appears to you to be poor in spirit 
and in life but his hand does not know where it should reach in all this 
indescribable fullness 
he gives you a small insignificant fruit which has just fallen at his fiet 
i t appears worthless to you but if you consider it you will see that this fruit 
tastes like a sun which you could not have dreamt of it gives off a peifume 
which confuses your senses and makes you dream of rose gardens and sweet 
wine and whispering palm trees and you hold this one fruit in your hands 
dreaming and you would like the tree in which it grows the garden in which 
this tree stands and the sun which brought forth this garden 
and you yourself want to be that solitary who strolls with the sun in his 
garden his gaze resting on pendant jfowers and his hand brushing a hundred 
fold of grain and his breath drinking the peifume from a thousand roses 
dullfrom the sun and drunk from firmenting wines you lie down in 
ancient graves whose walls resound with many voices and many colors of a 
thousand solar years 
when you grow then you see everything living again as it was and  
when you sleep you rest like everything that was and your dreams echo 
softly again from distant temple chants 
you sleep down through the thousand solar years and you wake up 
through the thousand solar years and your dreams full of ancient lore adorn 
might believe he was not that light but was sent to bear witness of that light that was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world he was 
in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not 
 john ii and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth

 i liber secundus  
the walls of your bedchamber 
you also see yourself in the totality 
you sit and lean against the wall and look at the beautiful 
riddlesome totality the summa lies before you like a book and 
an unspeakable greed seizes you to devour it consequently you 
lean back and stiffen and sit for a long time you are completely 
incapable of grasping it here and there a light flickers here and 
there a fruit falls from high trees which you can grasp here and 
there your foot strikes gold but what is it if you compare it with 
the totality which lies spread out tangibly close to you you stretch 
out your hand but it remains hanging in invisible webs you want 
to see it exactly as it is but something cloudy and opaque pushes 
itself exactly in between you would like to tear a piece out of it it 
is smooth and impenetrable like polished steel so you sink back 
against the wall and when you have crawled through all the glow
ing hot crucibles of the hell of doubt you sit once more and lean 
back and look at the wonder of the summa that lies spread 
out before you here and there a light flickers here and there a 
fruit falls for you it is all too little but you begin to be satisfied 
with yourself and you pay no attention to the years passing 
away what are years what is hurrying time to him that sits 
under a tree your time passes like a breath of air and you wait 
for the next light the next fruit 
the writing lies before you and always says the same if you 
believe in words but if you believe in things in whose places 
only words stand you never come to the end and yet you must 
go an endless road since life flows not only down a finite path 
but also an infinite one but the unbounded makes you anxious 
since the unbounded is fearful and your humanity rebels against 
it consequently you seek limits and restraints so that you do not 
lose yoursel tumbling into infinity restraint becomes imperative 
for you you cry out for the word which has one meaning and 
no other so that you escape boundless ambiguity the word 
becomes your god since it protects you from the countless 
possibilities of interpretation the word is protective magic 
against the daimons of the unending which tear at your soul and 
want to scatter you to the winds you are saved if you can say at 
last that is that and only that you spealc the magic word and 
the limitless is finally banished because of that men seek and 
make words  
he who breaks the wall of words overthrows gods and defiles 
temples the solitary is a murderer he murders the people because 
he thus thinks and thereby breaks down ancient sacred walls he 
calls up the daimons of the boundless and he sits leans back 
and does not hear the groans of mankind whom the fearful fiery 
smoke has seized and yet you cannot find the new words if you 
do not shatter the old words but no one should shatter the old 
words unless he finds the new word that is a firm rampart against 
the limitless and grasps more life in it than in the old word a new 
word is a new god for old men man remains the same even if 
you create a new model of god for him he remains an imitator 
what was word shall become man the word created the world 
and came before the world it lit up like a light in the darkness 
and the darkness did not comprehend it  and thus the word 
 latin for whole should become what the darkness can comprehend since what 
use is the light if the darkness does not comprehend it but your 
darkness should grasp the light 
the god of words is cold and dead and shines from afar like 
the moon mysteriously and inaccessibly let the word return to 
its  creator to man and thus the word will be heightened in 
man man should be light limits measure may he be your fruit 
for which you longingly reach the darkness does not compre
hend the word but rather man indeed it seizes him since he 
himself is a piece of the darkness not from the word down to 
man but from the word up to man that is what the darkness 
comprehends the darkness is your mother she behooves rev
erence since the mother is dangerous she has power over you 
since she gave birth to you honor the darkness as the light and 
you will illumine your darkness 
if you comprehend the darkness it seizes you it comes over you 
like the night with black shadows and countless shimmering stars 
silence and peace come over you if you begin to comprehend the 
darkness only he who does not comprehend the darkness fears 
the night through comprehending the dark the nocturnal the 
abyssal in you you become utterly simple and you prepare to 
sleep through the millennia like everyone else and you sleep down 
into the womb of the millennia and your walls resound with 
ancient temple chants since the simple is what always was peace 
and blue night spread over you while you dream in the grave of 
the millennia

hi   awaken the day reddens the east a night a wonderful 
night in the distant depths of time lies behind me in what faraway 
space was i what did i dream of a white horse it seems to me 
as if i had seen this white horse on the eastern sky over the rising 
sun the horse spoke to me what did it say it said hail him 
who is in darkness since the day is over him there were four 
white horses each with golden wings they led the carriage of the 
sun on which helios stood with flaring mane i stood down in 
the gorge astonished and frightened a thousand black serpents 
crawled swiftly into their holes helios ascended rolling upward 
toward the wide paths of the sky i knelt down raised my hands 
suppliantly and called give us your light you are flamecurled 
entwined crucified and revived give us your light your light this 
cry woke me didnt ammonius say yesterday evening do not 
forget to say your morning prayer when the sun rises i thought 
that perhaps he secretly worships the sun  
outside a fresh morning wind rises yellow sand trickles in 
fine veins down the rocks the redness expands across the sky 
and i see the first rays shoot up to the firmament solemn calm 
and solitude on all sides a large lizard lies on a stone and awaits the 
sun i stand as if spellbound and laboriously remember everything 
from yesterday especially what ammonius said but what did he 
say that the sequences of words have many meanings and that 
 the draft has to you and the corrected draft has to me p  throughout this section the corrected draft substitutes to me for to you and i for you p 
 in  jung commented on protective word magic transformation symbolism in the mass cw ii  
 see note  above 
 the corrected draft has the anchorite second day morning p 
 in the philosophical tree  jung noted a man who is rooted below as well as above is sort of like an upright and inverted tree the goal is not the heights but 
the center cw   he also commented on the inverted tree iof 
 january i  
 in greek mythology helios was the sun god and he drove a chariot led by four horses across the sky

 john brought the aorol to man but that does not sound properly 
christian is he perhaps a gnostic no that seems impossible 
to me since they were really the worst of all the idolators of 
words as he would probably put it 
the sunwhat fills me with such inner exaltation i should 
not forget my morning prayerbut where has my morning prayer 
gone dear sun i have no prayer since i do not know how one must 
address you have i already prayed to the sun but ammonius 
really meant that i should pray to god at the break of day he 
probably does not knowwe have no more prayers how should 
he know about our nakedness and poverty what has happened 
to our prayers i miss them here this must really be because of 
the desert it seems as if there ought to be prayers here is this desert 
so very bad i think it is no worse than our cities but why then 
do we not pray there i must look toward the sun as if it had 
something to do with this alasone can never escape the ageold 
dreams of mankind 
what shall i do this whole long morning i do not understand 
how ammonius could have endured this life for even a year i go 
back and forth on the driedup river bed and finally sit down on 
a boulder before me there are a few yellow grasses over there a 
small dark beetle is crawling along pushing a ball in front of ita 
scarab  you dear little animal are you still toiling away in order 
to live your beautiful myth how seriously and undiscouraged it 
works if only you had a notion that you are performing an old 
myth you would probably renounce your fantasies as we men 
have also given up playing at mythology 
the unreality nauseates one what i say sounds very odd in 
this place and the good ammonious would certainly not agree 
with it what am i actually doing here no i dont want to 
condemn him in advance since i still havent really understood 
what he actually means he has a right to be heard by the way 
i thought differently yesterday i was even very thankful to him 
that he wanted to teach me but im being critical once again 
and superior and may well learn nothing his thoughts are not 
that bad at all they are even good i dont know why i always 
want to put the man down 
dear beetle where have you gone i can no longer see you
oh youre already over there with your mythical ball these little 
animals stick to things quite unlike usno doubt no change of 
mind no hesitation is this so because they live their myth 
d ear scarab my father i honor you blessed be your workin 
eternityamen 
what nonsense am i talking im worshiping an animal
that must be because of the desert it seems absolutely to 
demand prayers 
how beautiful it is here the reddish color of the stones is 
wonderful they reflect the glow of a hundred thousand past suns
these small grains of sand have rolled in fabulous primordial 
oceans over them swam primordial monsters with forms never 
beheld before where were you man in those days on this warm 
sand lay your childish primordial animal ancestors like children 
snuggling up to their mother 
o mother stone i love you i lie snuggled up against your warm body 
your late child blessed be you ancient mother 
 yours is my heart and all glory and poweramen dies ii i  
what am i saying that was the desert how everything 
appears so animated to me this place is truly terrible these 
stonesare they stones they seem to have gathered here 
deliberately theyre lined up like a troop transport theyve 
arranged themselves by size the large ones stand apart the small 
ones close ranks and gather in groups that precede the large 
ones here the stones form states 
am i dreaming or am i awake its hotthe sun already stands 
highhow the hours pass truly the morning is nearly overand 
how astonishing it has been is it the sun or is it these living stones 
or is it the desert that makes my head buzz 
i go up the valleyand before long i reach the hut of the anchorite 
he is sitting on his mat lost in deep reflection 
i my father i am here 
a how have you spent your morning 
i i was surprised when you said yesterday that time passes 
quickly for you i dont question you anymore and this will no 
longer surprise me ive learned a lot but only enough to make 
you an even greater riddle than you were before why all the 
things that you must experience in the desert you wonderful 
man even the stones are bound to speak to you 
a im happy that you have learned to understand something 
of the life of an anchorite that will make our difficult task easier 
i dont want to intrude on your mysteries but i feel that you come 
from a strange world that has nothing to do with mine 
i you speak truthfully im a stranger here more foreign 
than any youve ever seen even a man from britains remotest 
coast is closer to you than i am therefore have patience master
and let me drink from the source of your wisdom although the 
thirsty desert surrounds us an invisible stream of living water 
flows here 
a have you said your prayer 
i master forgive me ive tried but i found no prayer yet i 
dreamed that i prayed to the rising sun 
a dont worry yourself because of that if you do find a word 
your soul has nevertheless found inexpressible words to greet the 
break of day 
i but it was a heathen prayer to helios 
a let that suffice for you 
i but oh master ive prayed not only to the sun in a dream 
but in my absentmindedness also to the scarab and the earth 
a be astonished at nothing and in no case condemn or regret 
it let us go to work do you want to ask something about the 
conversation we had yesterday 
i i interrupted you yesterday when you spoke of philo you 
wanted to explain your notion of the various meanings of particular 
sequences of words 
a well ill continue my account of how i was freed from the 
awful predicament of spinning words a man my father had set 
free once came to me this man whom id been attached to since 
my childhood spoke to me and said 
oh ammonius are you well certainly i said as you 
can see i am learned and have great success 
he i mean are you happy and are you fully alive 
i laughed as you can see all is well 
the old man replied i saw how you lectured you 
seemed to be anxious at the judgment of your listeners 
 during this period jung was engaged with the study of gnostic texts in which he found historical parallels to his own experiences see alfred ribi die suche nach 
den eigenen wurzeln die bedeutung von gnosis hermetik und alchemie fur c g  ung und marielouise von franz und deren einjfuss auf das moderne verstdndnis dieser disziplin 
bern peter lang  
 in synchronicity as a principle of acausal connection  jung wrote the scarab is a classical rebirth symbol according to the description in the ancient egyptian 
book amtuat the dead sun god transforms himself at the tenth station into khepri the scarab and as such mounts the barge at the twelfth station which raises 
the rejuvenated sun into the morning sky cw

 i liber secundus  
you wove witty jokes into the lecture to please your listeners 
you heaped up learned expressions to impress them you 
were restless and hasty as if still compelled to snatch up all 
knowledge you are not in yourself 
although these words at first seemed laughable to me 
they still made an impression on me and reluctantly i had 
to  credit the old man since he was right 
then he said dear ammonius i have delightful 
tidings for you god has become flesh in his son and has 
brought us all salvation what are you saying i called you 
probably mean osiris who shall appear in the mortal body 
no he replied this man lived in judea and was 
born from a virgin 
i laughed and answered i already know about this 
a jewish trader has brought tidings of our virgin queen 
to judea whose image appears on the walls of one of our 
temples and reported it as a fairy tale 
no the old man insisted he was the son of god 
then you mean horus the son of osiris dont you 
i answered 
no he was not horus but a real man and he was hung 
from a cross 
oh but this must be seth surely whose punishments 
our old ones have often described 
but the old man stood by his conviction and said he 
died and rose up on the third day 
well then he must be osiris i replied impatiently 
no he cried he is called jesus the anointed one 
ah you really mean this jewish god whom the poor 
honor at the harbor and whose unclean mysteries they 
celebrate in cellars 
he was a man and yet the son of god said the old 
man staring at me intently 
thats nonsense dear old man i said and showed 
him to the door but like an echo from distant rock faces 
the words returned to me a man and yet the son of god it 
seemed significant to me and this phrase was what brought 
me to christianity 
i but dont you think that christianity could ultimately be a 
transformation of your egyptian teachings 
a if you say that our old teachings were less adequate 
expressions of christianity then im more likely to agree with you 
i yes but do you then assume that the history of religions is 
aimed at a final goal 
a my father once bought a black slave at the market from the 
region of the source of the nile he came from a country that had 
heard of neither osiris nor the other gods he told me many things 
in a more simple language that said the same as we believed about 
osiris and the other gods i learned to understand that those 
uneducated negroes unknowingly already possessed most of 
what the religions of the cultured peoples had developed into 
complete doctrines those able to read that language correctly 
could thus recognize in it not only the pagan doctrines but also the 
doctrine of jesus and its with this that i now occupy myself 
i read the gospels and seek their meaning which is yet to come we know their meaning as it lies before us but not their hidden 
meaning which points to the future its erroneous to believe that 
religions differ in their innermost essence strictly speaking its 
always one and the same religion every subsequent form of religion 
is the meaning of the antecedent 
i have you found out the meaning which is yet to come 
a no not yet its very difficult but i hope ill succeed 
sometimes it seems to me that i need the stimulation of others 
but i realize that those are temptations of satan 
i dont you believe that youd succeed if you were nearer men 
a perhaps youre right 
he looks at me suddenly as if doubtful and suspicious but 
he continues i love the desert do you understand this yellow 
sunglowing desert here you can see the countenance of the sun 
every day you are alone you can see glorious heliosno that is 
paganwhats wrong with me im confusedyou are satan
i recognize yougive way adversary 
 he jumps up incensed and wants to lunge at me but i am 
far away in the twentieth century 
 hi  he who sleeps in the grave cifthe millennia dreams a wondeiful 
dream he dreams a primordially ancient dream he dreams cif the rising sun 
if you sleep this sleep and dream this dream in this time of the world you 
will know that the sun will also rise at this time for the moment we are still 
in the dark but the day is upon us 
he who comprehends the darkness in himself to him the light is near he 
who climbs down into his darkness reaches the staircase of the working light 
firemaned h elios 
h is chariot ascends with four white horses his back bears no cross and his 
side no wound but he is safi and his head blazes in the fire 
nor is he a man of mockery but of splendor and unquestionable force 
i do not know what i speak i speak in a dream support me for i stagger 
drunk with fire i drank fire in this night since i climbed down through the 
centuries and plunged into the sun far at the bottom and i rose up drunk 
from the sun with a burning countenance and my head is ablaze 
give me your hand a human hand so that you  can hold me to the earth 
with itfor whirling veins offire swoop me up and exultant longing tears me 
toward the zenith 
but day is about to break actual day the day of this world and i 
remain concealed in the gorge of the earth deep down and solitary 
and in the darkening shadows of the valley that is the shadow and 
heaviness of the earth 
how can i pray to the sun that rises far in the east over the 
desert why should i pray to it i drink the sun within me so 
why should i pray to it but the desert the desert in me demands 
prayers since the desert wants to satisfy itself with what is alive 
i want to beg god for it the sun or one of the other immortals 
i beg because i am empty and am a beggar in the day of this 
world i forget that i drank the sun and am drunk from its active 
light and singeing power but i stepped into the shadows of the 
earth and saw that i am naked and have nothing to cover my 
poverty no sooner do you touch the earth than your inner life is 
over it flees from you into things 
and a wondrous life arises in things what you thought was 
 osiris was the egyptian god of life death and fertility seth was the god of the desert seth was murdered and dismembered by his brother osiris osiriss body was 
recovered and put back together by his wife isis and he was resurrected jung discussed osiris and seth in traniformations and symbols of the libido  cw b f 
 horus osiriss son was the egyptian god of the sky he fought against seth 
 the corrected drft continues and i am unreal to myself as in a dream p  christian anchorites were perpetually on guard against the appearance of satan a 
famous example of temptations by the devil occurs in athanasiuss life of st anthony in  jung noted that st anthony warned his monks how cleverly the devil 
disguised himself in order to bring holy men to their downfall the devil is naturally the voice of the anchorites own unconscious that rises up against the forcible 
suppression of his nature psychological types cw   st anthonys experiences were elaborated by flaubert in his temptation of anthony a work with which jung 
was familiar psychology and alchemy cw

dead and inanimate betrays a secret life and silent inexorable 
intent you have got caught up in a hustle and bustle where 
everything goes its own way with strange gestures beside you 
above you beneath you and through you even the stones speak 
to you and magical threads spin from you to things and from 
things to you far and near work within you and you work 
in a dark manner upon the near and the far and you are always 
helpless and a prey 
but if you watch closely you will see what you have never seen 
before namely that things live their life and that they live off you 
the rivers bear your life to the valley one stone falls upon another 
with your force plants and animals also grow through you and 
they are the cause of your death a leaf dancing in the wind dances 
with you the irrational animal guesses your thought and represents 
you the whole earth sucks its life from you and everything 
reflects you again 
nothing happens in which you are not entangled in a secret 
manner for everything has ordered itself around you and plays 
your innermost nothing in you is hidden to things no matter 
how remote how precious how secret it is it inheres in things 
your dog robs you of your father who passed away long ago and 
looks at you as he did the cow in the meadow has intuited your 
mother and charms you with total calm and security the stars 
whisper your deepest mysteries to you and the soft valleys of the 
earth rescue you in a motherly womb 
like a stray child you stand pitifully among the mighty who 
hold the threads of your life you cry for help and attach yourself 
to the first person that comes your way perhaps he can advise you 
perhaps he knows the thought that you do not have and which all 
things have sucked out of you 
i know that you would like to hear the tidings of he whom things have 
not lived but who lived and fulfilled himself for you are a son of the earth 
sucked dry by the suckling earth that can suck nothing out of itself but suckles 
only from the sun therefore you would like to have tidings of the son of the 
sun which shines and does not suckle 
 you would like to hear of the son of god who shone and gave who 
begot and to whom life was born again as the earth bears the sun green and 
colorful children 
you would like to hear of him the radiating savior who as a son of the 
sun cut through the webs of the earth who sundered the magic threads and 
released those in bondage who owned himself and was no ones servant who 
sucked no one dry and whose treasure no one exhausted 
you would like to hear of him who was not darkened by the shadow of 
earth but illuminated it who saw the thoughts of all and whose thoughts 
no one guessed who possessed in himself the meaning of all things and whose 
meaning no thing could express 
the solitary fled the world he closed his eyes plugged his ears 
and buried himself in a cave within himself but it was no use 
the desert sucked him dry the stones spoke his thoughts the 
cave echoed his feelings and so he himself became desert stone 
and cave and it was all emptiness and desert and helplessness 
and barrenness since he did not shine and remained a son of the 
earth who sucked a book dry and was sucked empty by the desert 
he was desire and not splendor completely earth and not sun 
 an inversion of aristotles definition of man as the rational animal 
 see jungs description of the pleroma p  below death i  
consequently he was in the desert as a clever saint who very 
well knew that otherwise he was no different from the other sons 
of the earth if he would have drunk of himself he would have 
drunk fire 
the solitary went into the desert to find himself but he did 
not want to find himsel but rather the manifold meaning of holy 
scripture you can suck the immensity of the small and the great 
into yoursel and you will become emptier and emptier since 
immense fullness and immense emptiness are one and the same 
he wanted to find what he needed in the outer but you 
find manifold meaning only in yourself not in things since the 
manifoldness of meaning is not something that is given at the 
same time but is a succession of meanings the meanings that 
follow one another do not lie in things but lie in you who are  
subject to many changes insofar as you take part in life things 
also change but you do not notice this if you do not change but 
if you change the countenance of the world alters the manifold 
sense of things is your manifold sense it is useless to fathom it 
in things and this probably explains why the solitary went into 
the desert and fathomed the thing but not himself 
and therefore what happened to every desirous solitary also 
happened to him the devil came to him with smooth tongue and 
clear reasoning and knew the right word at the right moment he 
lured him to his desire i had to appear to him as the devil since 
i had accepted my darkness i ate the earth and i drank the sun 
and i became a greening tree that stands alone and grows  
death 
cap vi 
hi  on the following night i wandered to the northern 
land and found myself under a gray sky in mistyhazy coolmoist 
air i strive to those lowlands where the weak currents flashing in 
broad mirrors stream toward the sea where all haste of flowing 
becomes more and more dampened and where all power and all 
striving unites with the immeasurable extent of the sea the trees 
become sparse wide swamp meadows accompany the still murky 
water the horizon is unending and lonely draped by gray clouds 
slowly with restrained breath and with the great and anxious 
expectation of one gliding downward wildly on the foam and 
pouring himself into endlessness i follow my brother the sea 
it flows softly and almost imperceptibly and yet we continually 
approach the supreme embrace entering the womb of the source 
the boundless expansion and immeasurable depths lower yellow 
hills rise there a broad dead lake widens at their feet we wander 
along the hills quietly and they open up to a dusky unspeakably 
remote horizon where the sky and the sea are fused into infinity 
someone is standing there on the last dune he is wearing 
a black wrinkled coat he stands motionless and looks into the 
distance i go up to himhe is gaunt and with a deeply serious 
look in his eyes i say to him 
let me stand beside you for a while dark one i recognized 
you from afar there is only one who stands this way so solitary and 
at the last corner of the world 
 the drqft and corrected drqft continue but i saw solitude and its beauty and i seized the life of the inanimate and the meaning of the meaningless i also understood 
this side of my manifoldness and thus my tree grew in the solitude and quiet eating the earth with roots reaching far down and drinking the sun with branches reaching 
high up the solitary alien guest entered my soul but my greening life flooded me thus i wandered following the nature of the water the solitude gtewand
extended around llle i did not knowhov unlimited the solitude was and i wandered and looked i wanted to fatholll the depths of solitude and i went so far until 
every last sound of life died p

 i liber secundus  
he answered stranger you may well stand by me if it is not 
too cold for you as you can see i am cold and my heart has 
never beaten 
i know you are ice and the end you are the cold silence of the 
stones and you are the highest snow on the mountains and the 
most extreme frost of outer space i must feel this and thats why 
i stand near you 
what leads you here to me you living matter the living are 
never guests here well they all flow past here sadly in dense 
crowds all those above in the land of the clear day who have taken 
their departure  never to return again but the living never come 
here what do you seek here 
my strange and unexpected path led me here as i happily 
followed the way of the living stream and thus i found you i 
gather this is your place your rightful place 
yes here it leads into the undifferentiable where none is 
equal or unequal but all are one with one another do you see 
what approaches there 
i see something like a dark all of clouds swimming toward 
us on the tide 
look more closely what do you recognize 
i see densely pressed multitudes of men old men women 
and children between them i see horses oxen and smaller 
animals a cloud of insects swarms around the multitude a 
forest swims near innumerable faded flowers an utterly dead 
summer they are already near how stiff and cool they all 
look their feet do not move no noise sounds from their closed 
ranks they are clasping themselves rigidly with their hands 
and arms they are gazing beyond and pay us no heed they are 
all flowing past in an enormous stream dark one this vision 
is awful 
you wanted to stay by me so get hold of yourself look 
i see the first rows have reached the point where the surf 
and the stream flow together violently and it looks as if a wave 
of air were confronting the stream of the dead together with the 
surging sea whirling them up high scattering them in black scraps 
and dissolving them in murky clouds of mist wave after wave 
approaches and ever new droves dissolve into black air dark one 
tell me is this the end 
look 
the dark sea breaks heavilya reddish glow spreads out in 
itit is like blood a sea of blood foams at my feetthe depths 
of the sea glowhow strange i feelam i suspended by my feet 
is it the sea or is it the sky blood and fire mix themselves together 
in a ballred light erupts from its smoky shrouda new sun 
escapes from the bloody sea and rolls gleamingly toward the 
uttermost depthsit disappears under my feet 
i look around me i am all alone night has fallen what did 
ammonius say night is the time of silence 
 hi  i looked around me and i saw that the solitude 
expanded into the immeasurable and pierced me with horrible 
coldness the sun still glowed in me but i could feel myself 
stepping into the great shadow i follow the stream that makes its 
 cf the vision in liber primus ch  descent into hell in the future p i way into the depths slowly and unperturbed into the depths of 
what is to come 
and thus i went out in that night it was the second night of 
the year  and anxious expectation filled me i went out to 
embrace the future the path was wide and what was to come was 
awful it was the enormous dying a sea of blood from it the new 
sun arose awful and a reversal of that which we call day we have 
seized the darkness and its sun will shine above us bloody and 
burning like a great downfall 
when i comprehended my darkness a truly magnificent night 
came over me and my dream plunged me into the depths of the 
millennia and from it my phoenix ascended 
but what happened to my day torches were kindled bloody 
anger and disputes erupted as darkness seized the world the 
terrible war arose and the darkness destroyed the light of the 
world since it was incomprehensible to the darkness and good 
for nothing anymore and so we had to taste hell 
i saw which vices the virtues of this time changed into how 
your mildness became hard your goodness became brutality your 
love became hate and your understanding became madness 
why did you want to comprehend the darkness but you had to 
or else it would have seized you happy the man who anticipates 
this grasp 
did you ever think of the evil in you oh you spoke of it you 
mentioned it and you confessed it smilingly as a generally human 
vice or a recurring misunderstanding but did you know  what 
evil is and that it stands precisely right behind your virtues that 
it is also your virtues themselves as their inevitable substance 
you locked satan in the abyss for a millennium and when the 
millennium had passed you laughed at him since he had become 
a childrens fairy tale but if the dreadful great one raises his 
head the world winces the most extreme coldness draws near 
with horror you see that you are defenseless and that the 
army of your vices falls powerless to its knees with the power 
of daimons you seize the evil and your virtues cross over to him 
you are completely alone in this struggle since your gods have 
become deaf you do not know which devils are greater your 
vices or your virtues but of one thing you are certain that virtues 
and vices are brothers 
we need the coldness of death to see clearly life wants to 
live and to die to begin and to end you are not forced to live 
eternally but you can also die since there is a will in you for both 
life and death must strike a balance in your existence todays 
men need a large slice of death since too much incorrectness 
lives in them and too much correctness died in them what 
stays in balance is correct what disturbs balance is incorrect but if 
balance has been attained then that which preserves it is incorrect 
and that which disturbs it is correct balance is at once life and 
death for the completion of life a balance with death is fitting 
if i accept death then my tree greens since dying increases life 
if i plunge into the death encompassing the world then my buds 
break open how much our life needs death 
 in  jung wrote evil is relative partly avoidable partly fate the same goes for virtue and one often does not know which is worst ttempt at a psychological 
interpretation of the dogma of the trinity cw ii  
 in the corrected draft this sentence is replaced with evil is onehalf of the world one of the two pans of the scale p  
 the draft continues in this bloody battle death steps up to you just like today where mass killing and dying fill the world the coldness of death penetrates you 
when i froze to death in my solitude i saw dearly and saw what was to come as dearly as i could see the stars and the distant mountains on a frosty night p  
 in traniformations and symbols of the libido  jung had argued that the libido was not only a schopenhauerian life urge but contained the contrary striving toward 
death within itself cw b  
 the draft continues to live what is right and to let what is false die that is the art of life p  in  jung wrote life is an energetic process like any other 
but every energetic process is in principle irreversible and therefore unequivocally directed toward a goal and the goal is the state of rest  from the middle of life only he 
who is willing to die with life remains living since what takes place in the secret hour of lifes midday is the reversal of the parabola the birth of death  not wanting to live 
is identical with not wanting to die becoming and passing away is the same curve soul and death cw   see my the boundless expanse jungs reflections on

 joy at the smallest things comes to you only when you have 
accepted death but if you look out greedily for all that you could 
still live then nothing is great enough for your pleasure and the 
smallest things that continue to surround you are no longer a joy 
therefore i behold death since it teaches me how to live 
if you accept death it is altogether like a frosty night and an 
anxious misgiving but a frosty night in a vineyard full of sweet 
grapes you will soon take pleasure in your wealth death ripens 
one needs death to be able to harvest the fruit without death 
life would be meaningless since the longlasting rises again and 
denies its own meaning to be and to enjoy your being you need 
death and limitation enables you to fulfill your being 
hi  when i see the lamentation and nonsense of the 
earth and consequently enter death with a covered head then 
everything i see will indeed turn to ice but in the shadow world 
the other rises the red sun it rises secretly and unexpectedly 
and my world revolves like a satanic apparition i suspect blood 
and murder blood and murder alone are still exalted and have 
their own peculiar beauty one can assume the beauty of bloody 
acts of violence 
but it is the unacceptable the awfully repulsive that which 
i have forever rejected that rises in me for if the wretched
ness and poverty of this life ends another life begins in what is 
opposed to me this is opposed to such an extent that i cannot 
conceive it for it is opposed not according to the laws of reason 
but thoroughly and according to its own nature yes it is not only 
opposed but repulsive invisibly and cruelly repulsive something 
that takes my breath away that drains the power from my muscles 
that confuses my senses stings me poisonously from behind in 
the heel and always strikes just where i did not suspect i possessed 
a vulnerable spot 
it does not confront me like a strong enemy manly and 
dangerously but i perish on a dung heap while peaceful chickens 
cackle around me amazedly and mindlessly laying their eggs a 
dog passes lifts his leg over me then trots off calmly i curse the 
hour of my birth seven times and if i do not choose to kill myself 
on the spot i prepare to experience the hour of my second birth 
the ancients said inter faeces et urinas nascimur for three nights i 
was assaulted by the horrors of birth on the third night junglelike

hi  yet another new adventure occurred wide meadows 
spread out before mea carpet of flowerssoft hillsa fresh green 
wood in the distance i come across two strange journeymen
probably two completely accidental companions an old monk 
 see above note  p i 
 a reference to the vision above the remains of earlier temples i  
and a tall gangly thin man with a childish gait and discolored red 
clothes as they draw near i recognize the tall one as the red rider 
how he has changed he has grown old his red hair has become 
gray his fiery red clothes are worn out shabby poor and the other 
he has a paunch and appears not to have fallen on bad times but 
his face seems familiar by all the gods its ammonius 
what changes and where are these utterly different people 
coming from i approach them and bid them good day both 
look at me frightened and make the sign of the cross their 
horror prompts me to look down at myself i am fully covered 
in green leaves which spring from my body i greet them a second 
time laughing  
ammonius exclaims horrified apage satanas 
the red one damned pagan riffraff 
i but my dear friends whats wrong with you im the 
hyperborean stranger who visited you oh ammonius in the 
desert and im the watchman whom you red one once visited 
ammonius i recognize you you supreme devil my downfall 
began with you 
the red one looks at him reproachfully and gives him a 
poke in the ribs the monk sheepishly stops the red one turns 
haughtily toward me 
r already at that time i couldnt help thinlcing that you 
lacked a noble disposition notwithstanding your hypocritical 
seriousness your damned christian playact 
at this moment ammonius pokes him in the ribs and the 
red one falls into an embarrassed silence and thus both stand 
before me sheepish and ridiculous and yet pitiable 
i wherefrom man of god what outrageous fate has led 
you here let alone in the company of the red one 
a i would prefer not to tell you but it does not appear to be 
a dispensation of god that one can escape so know then that you 
evil spirit have done me a terrible deed you seduced me with  
your accursed curiosity desirously stretching my hand after the 
divine mysteries since you made me conscious at that time that 
i really knew nothing about them your remark that i probably 
needed the closeness of men to arrive at the higher mysteries 
stunned me like infernal poison soon thereafter i called the 
brothers of the valley together and announced to them that a 
messenger of god had appeared to meso terribly had you blinded 
meand commanded me to form a monastery with the brothers 
when brother philetus raised an objection i refuted him with 
reference to the passage in the holy scriptures where it is said that 
it is not good for man to be alone so we founded the monastery 
near the nile from where we could see the passing ships 
we cultivated fat fields and there was so much to do that the 
holy scriptures fell into oblivion we became voluptuous and one 
day i was filled with such terrible longing to see alexandria again 
i talked myself into believing that i wanted to visit the bishop 
there but first i was intoxicated so much by life on the ship and 
then by the milling crowds on the streets of alexandria that i 
became completely lost 
 in traniformations and symbols ojthe libido  jung commented on the motif of the wounded heel cw b  
 we are born between faeces and urine a saying widely attributed to st augustine among others

  i liber secundus  
as in a dream i climbed onto a large ship bound for italy i 
felt an insatiable greed to see the world i drank wine and saw that 
women were beautiful i wallowed in pleasure and wholly turned 
into an animal when i climbed ashore in naples the red one 
stood there and i knew that i had fallen into the hands of evil 
r be silent old fool if i had not been present you would 
have become an outright pig when you saw me you finally 
pulled yourself together cursed the drinking and the women and 
returned to the monastery 
now hear my story damned hobgoblin i too fell into your 
snare and your pagan arts also enticed me after the conversation 
at that time where you caught me in the fox trap with your 
remark about dancing i became serious so serious that i went 
into the monastery prayed fasted and converted myself 
in my blindness i wanted to reform the church liturgy and 
with the bishops approval i introduced dancing 
i became abbot and as such alone had the sole right to dance 
before the altar like david before the ark of the covenarit but 
little by little the brothers also began to dance indeed even the 
congregation of the faithful and finally the whole city danced 
it was terrible i fled into solitude and danced all day until i 
dropped but in the morning the hellish dance began again 
i sought to escape from myself and strayed and wandered 
around at night in the daytime i kept myself secluded and 
danced alone in the forests and deserted mountains and thus 
gradually i came to italy down there in the south i no longer felt 
as i had felt in the north i could mingle with the crowds only 
in naples did i somewhat find my way again and there i also 
found this ragged man of god his appearance gave me strength 
through him i could regain my health youve heard how he took 
heart from me too and found his way again 
a i must confess i did not fare so badly with the red one hes 
a toneddown type of devil 
r i must add that the monk is hardly the fanatical type 
although ive developed a deep aversion against the whole 
christian religion since my experience in the monastery 
 dear friends it does my heart good to see you enjoying 
yourselves together 
both we are not pleased mocker and adversary clear off 
you robber pagan 
i but why are you traveling together if youre not enjoying 
each others company and friendshipr 
a what can be doner even the devil is necessary since 
otherwise one has nothing that commands a sense of respect 
with people 
r well i need to come to an arrangemerttwith the clergy or 
else i will lose my clientele 
i therefore the necessities of life have brought you together 
so lets make peace and be friends 
both but we can never be friends 
i oh i see the system is at fault you probably want to die 
out first now let me pass you old ghosts 
 hi  when i had seen death and all the terrible 
solemnity that is gathered around it and had become ice and 
night myself an angry life and impulse rose up in me my thirst 
for the rushing water of the deepest knowledge began to 
clink with wine glasses from afar i heard drunken laughter 
laughing women and street noise dance music  stamping and 
 in chronicles ii david dances before the ark of the covenant 
 the corrected draft has the wisdom instead of the deepest knowledge p i cheering poured forth from allover and instead of the rose
scented south wind the reek of the human animal streamed over 
me lusciouslewd whores giggled and rustled along the walls 
wine fumes and kitchen steam and the foolish cackling of the 
human crowd drew near in a cloud hot sticky tender hands 
reached out for me and i was swaddled in the covers of a sick
bed i was born into life from below and i grew up as heroes do 
in hours rather than years and after i had grown up i found 
myself in the middle land and saw that it was spring 
hi  but i was no longer the man i had been for a 
strange being grew through me this was a laughing being of 
the forest a leaf green daimon a forest goblin and prankster 
who lived alone in the forest and was itself a greening tree 
being who loved nothing but greening and growing who was 
neither disposed nor indisposed toward men full of mood 
and chance obeying an invisible law and greening and wilting 
with the trees neither beautiful nor ugly neither good nor 
bad merely living primordially old and yet completely young 
naked and yet naturally clothed not man but nature frightened 
laughable powerful childish weak deceiving and deceived utterly 
inconstant and superficial and yet reaching deep down down 
to the kernel of the world 
i had absorbed the life of both of my friends a green tree 
grew from the ruins of the temple they had not withstood 
life but seduced by life had become their own monkey business 
they had got caught in the muck and so they called the living a 
devil and traitor because both of them believed in themselves 
and in their own goodness each in his own way they ultimately 
became mired in the natural and conclusive burial ground of 
all outlived ideals the most beautiful and the best like the 
ugliest and the worst end up someday in the most laughable 
place in the world surrounded by fancy dress and led by fools 
and go horrorstruck to the pit of filth 
after the cursing comes laughter so that the soul is saved from the dead 
ideals are according to their essence desired and pondered 
they exist to this extent but only to this extent yet their effective 
being cannot be denied he who believes he is really living his 
ideals or believes he can live them suffers from delusions of 
grandeur and behaves like a lunatic in that he stages himself as an 
ideal but the hero has fallen ideals are mortal so one should 
prepare oneself for their end at the same time it probably costs you 
your neck for do you not see that it was you who gave meaning 
value and effective force to your idealr if you have become a 
sacrifice to the ideal then the ideal cracks open plays carnival 
with you and goes to hell on ash wednesday the ideal is also 
a tool that one can put aside anytime a torch on dark paths but 
whoever runs around with a torch by day is a fool how much 
my ideals have come down and how freshly my tree greens 
when i turned green they stood there the sad remains 
of earlier temples and rose gardens and i recognized with a 
shudder their inner affinity it seemed to me that they had 
established an indecent alliance but i understood that this 
alliance had already existed for a long time at a time when 
i still claimed that my sanctuaries were of crystal purity and 
when i compared my friends to the perfume of the roses of 
persia both of them formed an alliance of mutual silence 
 the draft and corrected draft have i had become a victim of my sanctuaries and beauties and so i died miserable and depressed therefore death came to me p  
 in persia the crushed petals of rose were steamdistilled to make rose oil from which perfumes were made

they seemed to scatter but secretly they worked together the 
solitary silence of the temple lured me far away from men to 
the supernatural mysteries in which i lost myself to the point 
of surfeit and while i struggled with god the devil prepared 
himself for my reception and tore me just as far to his side 
there too i found no boundaries other than surfeit and disgust 
i did not live but was driven i was a slave to my idealso 
and thus they stood there the ruins quarreling with one 
another and unable to reconcile themselves to their common 
misery within myself i had become one as a natural being but 
i was a hobgoblin who frightened the solitary wanderer and 
who avoided the places of men but i greened and bloomed from 
within myself i had still not become a man again who carried 
within himself the conflict between a longing for the world and 
a longing for the spirit i did not live either of these longings 
but i lived mysel and was a merrily greening tree in a remote 
spring forest and thus i learned to live without the world and 
spirit and i was amazed how well i could live like this 
but what about men what about mankind there they stood 
the two deserted bridges that should lead across to mankind 
one leads from above to below and men glide down on it which 
pleases them  the other leads from below to above and mankind 
groans upward on it this causes them trouble we drive our 
fellow men to trouble and joy if i myself do not live but merely 
climb it gives others undeserved pleasure if i simply enjoy 
mysel it causes others undeserved trouble if i merely live i 
am far removed from men they no longer see me and when 
they see me they are astonished and shocked i mysel however 
quite simply living greening blooming fading stand like a tree 
always in the same spot and let the suffering and the joy of men 
pass over me with equanimity and yet i am a man who cannot 
excuse himself from the discord of the human heart 
but my ideals can also be my dogs whose yapping and 
squabbling do not disturb me but at least then i am a good and 
a bad dog to men but i have not yet achieved what should be 
namely that i live and yet am a man it seems to be nearly impossible 
to live as a man as long as you are not conscious of your self you 
can live but if you become conscious of your sel you fall from 
one grave into another all your rebirths could ultimately make 
you sick the buddha therefore finally gave up on rebirth for 
he had had enough of crawling through all human and animal 
forms after all the rebirths you still remain the lion crawling 
on the earth the xamai aeqn chameleon a caricature one 
prone to changing colors a crawling shimmering lizard but 
precisely not a lion whose nature is related to the sun who draws 
his power from within himsel who does not crawl around in 
the protective colors of the environment and who does not 
defend himself by going into hiding i recognized the chameleon 
and no longer want to crawl on the earth and change colors and first day i  
be reborn instead i want to exist from my own force like the 
sun which gives light and does not suck light that belongs to the 
earth i recall my solar nature and would like to rush to my rising 
but ruins stand in my way they say with regard to men you 
should be this or that my chameleonesque skin shudders they 
obtrude upon me and want to color me but that should no longer 
be neither good nor evil shall be my masters i push them aside 
the laughable survivors and go on my way again which leads 
me to the east the quarreling powers that for so long stood 
between me and myself lie behind me 
henceforth i m completely alone i can no longer say to you 
listen or you should or you could but now i talk only with 
myself now no one else can do anything more for me nothing 
whatsoever i no longer have a duty toward you and you no lon
ger have duties toward me since i vanish and you vanish from 
me i no longer hear requests and no longer make requests of you 
i no longer fight and reconcile myself with you but place silence 
between you and me 
your call dies away in the distance and you cannot find my 
footprints together with the west wind which comes from the 
plains of the ocean i journey across the green countryside i 
roam through the forests and bend the young grass i talk with 
trees and the forest wildlife and the stones show me the way 
when i thirst and the source does not come to me i go to the 
source when i starve and the bread does not come to me i 
seek my bread and take it where i find it i provide no help and 
need no help if at any time necessity confronts me i do not 
look around to see whether there is a helper nearby but i accept 
the necessity and bend and writhe and struggle i laugh i weep 
i swear but i do not look around me 
on this way no one walks behind me and i cross no ones 
path i am alone but i fill my solitariness with my life i am man 
enough i am noise conversation comfort and help enough unto 
myself and so i wander to the far east not that i know any
thing about what my distant goal might be i see blue horizons 
before me they suffice as a goal i hurry toward the east and my 
risingi will my rising  image

 i liber secundus  
across and onward and finally the valley widens into a mighty 
rocky basin a narrow path winds up along vertical rocks to the 
mountain ridge at the top 
as i approach the top a mighty booming resounds from the 
other side of the mountain like ore being pounded the sound 
gradually swells and echoes thunderously in the mountain 
as i reach the pass i see an enormous man approach from the 
other side 
two bull horns rise from his great head and a rattling suit 
of armor covers his chest his black beard is ruffled and decked 
with exquisite stones the giant is carrying a sparkling double axe 
in his hand like those used to strike bulls before i can recover 
from my amazed fright the giant is standing before me i look 
at his face it is faint and pale and deeply wrinkled his almond
shaped eyes look at me astonished horror takes hold of me this 
is izdubar the mighty the bullman he stands and looks at me 
his face speals of consuming inner fear and his hands and knees 
tremble izdubar the powerful bull trembling is he frightened 
i callout to him 
oh izdubar most powerful spare my life and forgive me for 
lying like a worm in your path 
iz i do not want your life where do you come from 
i i come from the west 
iz you come from the west do you know of the western 
lands is this the right way to the western lands 
i i come from a western land whose coast washes against 
the great western sea 
iz does the sun sink in that sea or does it touch the solid 
land in its decline 
i the sun sinks far beyond the sea 
iz beyond the sea what lies there 
i there is nothing but empty space there as you know the 
earth is round and moreover it turns around the sun 
iz damned one where do you get such knowledge so there 
is no immortal land where the sun goes down to be reborn are 
you spealcing the truth 
his eyes flicker with fury and fear he steps a thundering 
pace closer i tremble 
i oh izdubar most powerful one forgive my presump
tuousness but im really speaking the truth i come from a land 
where this is proven science and where people live who travel 
round the world with their ships our scholars know through 
measurement how far the sun is from each point of the surface 
of the earth it is a celestial body that lies unspeakably far out in 
unending space 
iz unendingdid you say is the space of the world unending 
and we can never reach the sun 
i most powerful one insofar as you are mortal you can never 
reach the sun 
i see him overcome with suffocating fear 
iz i am mortaland i shall never reach the sun and never 
reach immortality 
he smashes his axe with a powerful clanging blow on the rock 
iz be gone miserable weapon you are not much use how 
should you be of use against infinity against the eternal void  
and against the unreplenishible there is no one left for you to 
conquer smash yoursel whats it worth in the west the sun sinks into the lap of glowing clouds in 
bright crimson 
so go away sun thricedamned god and wrap yourself in 
your immortality 
he snatches the smashed piece of his axe from the ground 
and hurls it toward the sun 
here you have your sacrifice your last sacrifice 
he collapses and sobs like a child i stand shaking and hardly 
dare stir 
iz miserable worm where did you suckle on this poison 
i oh izdubar most powerful one what you call poison is 
science in our country we are nurtured on it from youth and 
that may be one reason why we havent properly flourished and 
remain so dwarfish when i see you however it seems to me as 
if we are all somewhat poisonedloo 
iz no stronger being has ever cut me down no monster has 
ever resisted my strength but your poison worm which you have 
placed in my way has lamed me to the marrow your magical 
poison is stronger than the army of tiamatloi he lies as if 
paralyzed stretched out on the ground you gods help here 
lies your son cut down by the invisible serpents bite in his heel 
o h if only i had crushed you when i saw you and never heard 
your words 
i oh izdubar great and pitiable one had i known that my 
knowledge could cut you down i would have held my tongue 
but i wanted to speak the truth 
iz you call poison truth is poison truth or is truth poison 
do not our astrologers and priests also speal the truth and yet 
theirs does not act like poison 
i oh izdubar night is falling and it will get cold up here 
shall i not fetch you help from men 
iz let it be and answer me instead 
i but we cannot philosophize here of all places your wretched 
condition demands help 
iz i say to you let it be if i should perish this night so be it 
just give me an answer 
i im afraid my words are weak if they are to heal 
iz they cannot bring about something more grave 
the disaster has already happened so tell me what you 
know perhaps you even have a magic word that counteracts 
the poison 
i my words oh most powerful one are poor and have no 
magical power 
iz no matter speak 
i i dont doubt that your priests speak the truth it is certainly 
a truth only it runs contrary to our truth 
iz are there then two sorts of truth 
i it seems to me to be so our truth is that which comes to  
us from the knowledge of outer things the truth of your priests 
is that which comes to you from inner things 
iz half si tting up that was a salutary word 
i im fortunate that my weak words have relieved you oh 
if only i knew many more words that could help you it has now 
grown cold and dark ill make a fire to warm us 
iz do that as it might help i gathered wood and lit a big 
fire the holy fire warms me now tell me how did you make a 
fire so swiftly and mysteriously 
i all i need are matches look they are small pieces of wood

with a special substance at the tip rubbing them against the box 
produces fire 
iz that is astonishing where did you learn this art 
i everyone has matches where i come from but this is the 
least of it we can also fly with the help of useful machines  
iz you can fly like birds if your words did not contain such 
powerful magic i would say to you you were lying 
i im certainly not lying look i also have a timepiece for 
example which shows the exact time of day 
iz this is wonderful it is clear that you come from a strange 
and marvelous land you certainly come from the blessed western 
lands are you immortal 
i i immortal there is nothing more mortal than we are 
iz what you are not even immortal and yet you understand 
such arts 
i unfortunately our science has still not yet succeeded in 
finding a method against death 
iz who then taught you such arts 
i in the course of the centuries men have made many discoveries 
through precise observation and the science of outer things 
iz but this science is the awful magic that has lamed me how 
can it be that you are still alive even though you drink from this 
poison every day 
i weve grown accustomed to this over time because men 
get used to everything but were still somewhat lamed on the 
other hand this science also has great advantages as youve seen 
what weve lost in terms of force weve rediscovered many times 
through mastering the force of nature 
iz isnt it pathetic to be so wounded for my part i draw my 
own force from the force of nature i leave the secret force to the 
cowardly conjurers and womanly magicians if i crush anothers 
skull to pulp that will stop his awful magic 
i but dont you realize how the touch of our magic has 
worked upon you terribly i think 
iz unfortunately you are right 
i now you perhaps see that we had no choice we had to 
swallow the poison of science otherwise we would have met the 
same fate as you have wed be completely lamed if we encountered 
it unsuspecting and unprepared this poison is so insurmountably 
strong that everyone even the strongest and even the eternal 
gods perish because of it if our life is dear to us we prefer to 
sacrifice a piece of our life force rather than abandon ourselves to 
certain death 
iz i no longer think that you come from the blessed western 
lands your country must be desolate full of paralysis and 
renunciation i yearn for the east where the pure source of our 
lifegiving wisdom flows 
we sit silently at the flickering fire the night is cold izdubar 
groans and looks up at the starry sky above 
iz most terrible day of my lifeunendingso longso 
longwretched magical artour priests know nothing or else 
they could have protected me from iteven the gods die he says 
have you no gods anymore 
i no words are all we have 
iz but are these words powerful 
i so they claim but one notices nothing of this 
iz we do not see the gods either and yet we believe that they 
exist we recognize their workings in natural events 
i science has taken from us the capacity ofbelief first day i  
iz what you have lost that too how then do you live 
i we live thus with one foot in the cold and one foot in the 
hot and for the rest come what may 
iz you express yourself darkly 
i so it also is with us it is dark 
iz can you bear it 
i not particularly well i personally dont find myself at ease 
with it for that reason ive set out to the east to the land of the 
rising sun to seek the light that we lack where then does the 
sun rise 
iz the earth is as you say completely round thus the sun 
rises nowhere 
i i mean do you have the light that we lack  
iz look at me i flourish in the light of the western world 
from this you can measure how fruitful this light is but if you 
come from such a dark land then beware of such an overpowering 
light you could go blind just as we all are somewhat blind 
i if your light is as fantastic as you are then i will be careful 
iz you do well by this 
i i long for your truth 
iz s i long for the western lands i warn you 
silence descends it is late at night we fall asleep next to the fire 
 h i  i wandered toward the south and found the 
unbearable heat of solitude with myself i wandered toward the 
north and found the cold death from which all the world dies i 
withdrew to my western land where the men are rich in knowing 
and doing and i began to suffer from the suns empty darkness 
and i threw everything from me and wandered toward the east 
where the light rises daily i went to the east like a child i did not 
ask i simply waited 
cheerful flowery meadows and lovely spring forests hemmed 
my path but in the third night the heaviness came it stood 
before me like a range of cliffs full of sorrowful desolation and 
everything tried to deter me from following my lifes path but 
i found the entrance and the narrow way the torment was great 
since it was not for nothing that i had pushed the two dissipated 
and dissolute ones away from me i unsuspectingly absorb what i 
reject what i accept enters that part of my soul which i do not 
know i accept what i do to myselbut i reject what is done to me 
so the path of my life led me beyond the rejected opposites 
united in smooth andalasextremely painful sides of the way 
which lay before me i stepped on them but they burned and 
froze my soles and thus i reached the other side but the 
poison of the serpent whose head you crush enters you through 
the wound in your heel and thus the serpent becomes more 
dangerous than it was before since whatever i reject is never
theless in my nature i thought it was without and so i believed 
that i could destroy it but it resides in me and has only assumed 
a passing outer form and stepped toward me i destroyed its 
form and believed that i was a conqueror but i have not yet 
overcome myself 
the outer opposition is an image of my inner opposition 
once i realize this i remain silent and think of the chasm 
of antagonism in my soul outer oppositions are easy to over
come they indeed exist but nevertheless you can be united 
with yourself they will indeed burn and freeze your soles 
but only your soles it hurts but you continue and look toward 
distant goals

  i liber secundus  
as i rose to the highest point and my hope wanted to look 
out toward the east a miracle happened as i moved toward the 
east one from the east hurried toward me and strove toward the 
sinking light i wanted light he wanted night i wanted to rise he 
wanted to sink i was dwarfish like a child while he was enormous 
like an elementally powerful hero knowledge lamed me while he 
was blinded by the fullness of the light and so we hurried toward 
each other he from the light i from the darkness he strong i 
weak he god i serpent he ancient i utterly new he unknowing 
i knowing he fantastic i sober he brave powerful i cowardly 
cunning but we were both astonished to see one another on the 
border between morning and evening 
i was a child and grew like a greening tree and let the wind 
and distant cries and commotion of opposites  blow calmly 
through my branches i was a boy and mocked fallen heroes i 
was a youth pushing aside their clutching grips left and right 
and so i did not anticipate the powerful blind and immortal 
one who wandered longingly after the sinking sun who wanted 
to cleave the ocean down to its bottom so he could descend into 
the source of life that which hurries toward the rising is small 
that which approaches the descent is great hence i was small 
since i simply came from the depths of my descent i had been 
where he yearned to be he who descends is great and it would 
be easy for him to smash me a god who looks like the sun does not 
hunt worms but the worm aims at the heel of the powerful one 
and will prepare him for the descent that he needs his power is 
great and blind he is marvelous to look at and frightening but 
the serpent finds its spot a little poison and the great one falls 
the words of the one who rises have no sound and taste bitter 
it is not a sweet poison but one that is fatal for all gods 
alas he is my dearest most beautiful friend he who rushes across 
pursuing the sun and wanting to marry himself with the immeasurable 
mother as the sun does how closely akin indeed how completely one are the 
serpent and the god the word which was our deliverer has become a deadly 
weapon a serpent that secretly stabs 
no longer do outer opposites stand in my way but my own 
opposite comes toward me and rises up hugely before me and 
we block each others way the word of the serpent certainly 
defeats the danger but my way remains barred since i then had 
to fall from paralysis into blindness just as the powerful one fell 
into paralysis to escape his blindness i cannot reach the blinding 
power of the sun just as he the powerful one cannot reach the 
everfruitful womb of darkness i seem to be denied power while 
he is denied rebirth but i escape the blindness that comes with 
power and he escapes the nothingness that comes with death my 
hope for the fullness of the light shatters just as his longing for 
boundless conquered life shatters i had felled the strongest and 
the god climbs down to mortality 
 b  the mighty one foil he lies on the ground i 
power must subside for the sake of life 
the circumforence of outer life should be made smaller 
much more secrecy solitary fires fire caverns dark wide forests sparsely 
peopled settlements quietlyffowing streams silent winter and summer nights 
small ships and carriages and secure in dwellings the rare and precious 
i the draft continues this is what i saw in the dream p s 
i see liber secundus ch  p  from afar wanderers walk along solitary roads looking here and there 
hurrying becomes impossible patience grows  
 b  the noise of the days of the world falls silent and the warming 
fire blazes inside 
sitting at the fire the shades of those gone before wail softly and give news 
of the past 
come to the solitaryfire you blind and lame ones and hear of both kinds 
of truth the blind will be lamed and the lamed will be blinded yet the shared 
fire warms both in the lengthening night 
an old secret fire burns between us giving sparse light and ample warmth 
the primordial fire that conquers every necessity shall burn again since 
the night of the world is wide and cold and the need is great 
the wellprotected fire brings together those from far away and those who 
are cold those who do not see one another and cannot reach one another and 
it conquers suffiring and shatters need 
the words uttered at the fire are ambiguous and deep and show life the 
right way 
the blind shall be lamed so that he will not run into the abyss and the 
lamed shall be blind so that he will not look at things beyond his reach with 
longing and contempt 
both may be aware of their deep helplessness so that they will respect the 
holy fire again as well as the shades sitting at the hearth and the words that 
encircle the ffames 
the ancients called the saving word the logos an expression 
of divine reason i so much unreason  was in man that he 
needed reason to be saved if one waits long enough one sees 
how the gods all change into serpents and underworld dragons 
in the end this is also the fate of the logos in the end it poisons 
us all in time we were all poisoned but unknowingly we kept 
the one the powerful one the eternal wanderer in us away 
from the poison we spread poison and paralysis around us in 
that we want to educate all the world around us into reason 
some have their reason in thinking others in feeling both are 
servants of logos and in secret become worshipers of the serpent i 
you can subjugate yourself shackle yourself in irons whip 
yourself bloody every day you have crushed yourself but not 
overcome yourself precisely through this you have helped the 
powerful one strengthened your paralysis and promoted his 
blindness he would like to see it in others and inflict it on them 
and would like to force the logos on you and others longingly and 
tyrannically with blind obstinacy and vacant stubborness give 
him a taste of logos he is afraid and he already trembles from 
afar since he suspects that he has become outdated and that a tiny 
droplet of the poison of logos will paralyze him but because he is 
your beautiful much loved brother you will act slavishly toward 
him and you would like to spare him as you have spared none of 
your fellow men you spared no merry and no powerful means to 
strike your fellow men with the poisoned arrow paralyzed game is 
an unworthy prey the powerful huntsman who wrestles the bull 
to the ground and tears the lion to pieces and strikes the army of 
tiamat is your bows worthy targeti 
if you live as he whom you are he will come running against 
you impetuously and you can hardly miss him he will lay violent 
hands on you and force you into slavery if you do not remember 
your terrible weapon which you have always used in his service

 against yourself you will be cunning terrible and cold if you 
make the beautiful and much loved fall but you should not kill 
him even if he suffers and writhes in unbearable agony bind the 
holy sebastian to a tree and slowly and rationally shoot arrow 
after arrow into his twitching flesh when you do so remind 
yourself that each arrow that strikes him spares one of your 
dwarfish and lame brothers so you may shoot many arrows but 
there is a misunderstanding that occurs all too frequently and is 
almost ineradicable men always want to destroy the beautiful and 
much loved outside of themselves but never within themselves 
he the beautiful and most loved one came to me from the east 
from just that place which i was seeking to reach admiringly i 
saw his power and magnificence and i recognized that he was 
striving for precisely what i had abandoned namely my dark 
human milling crowd of abjection i recognized the blindness and 
unknowingness of his striving which worked against my desire 
and i opened his eyes and lamed his powerful limbs with a poisoned 
stab and he lay crying like a child as that which he was a child a 
primordial grown child that required human logos so he lay before 
me helpless my blind god who had become halfseeing and 
paralyzed and compassion seized me since it was plain to me 
that i should not let him die he who approached me from the 
rising from that place where he could be well but which i could 
never reach he whom i sought i now possessed the east could 
give me nothing other than him the sick and fallen one 
you need to undertake only half of the way he will undertake 
the other half if you go beyond him blindness will befall you 
if he goes beyond you paralysis will befall him therefore and 
insofar as it is the manner of the gods to go beyond mortals they 
become paralyzed and become as helpless as children divinity 
and humanity should remain preserved if man should remain 
before the god and the god remain before man the highblazing 
flame is the middle way whose luminous course runs between the 
human and the divine 
the divine primordial power is blind since its face has 
become human the human is the face ofthe godhead if the 
god comes near you then plead for your life to be spared since 
the god is loving horror the ancients said it is terrible to fall 
into the hands of the living godiob they spoke thus because they 
knew since they were still close to the ancient forest and they 
turned green like the trees in a childlike manner and ascended far 
away toward the east  
consequently they fell into the hands of the living god they 
learned to kneel and to lie with their faces down to beg for pity 
and they learned to live in servile fear and to be grateful but he 
who saw him the terrible beautiful one with his black velvet eyes 
and the long eyelashes the eyes that do not see but merely gaze 
lovingly and fearfully he has learned to cry out and whimper second day i  
so that he can at least reach the ear of the godhead only your 
fearful cry can stop the god and then you see that the god also 
trembles since he stands confronting his face his observing gaze 
in you and he feels unknown power the god is afraid of man 
if my god is lamed i must stand by him since i cannot abandon 
the muchloved i sense that he is my lot my brother who abided 
and grew in the light while i was in the darkness and fed myself 
with poison it is good to know such things if we are surrounded 
by night our brother stands in the fullness of the light doing his 
great deeds tearing up the lion and killing the dragon and he 
draws his bow against ever more distant goals until he becomes 
aware of the sun wandering high up in the sky and wants to 
catch it but when he has discovered his valuable prey then your 
longing for the light also awakens you discard the fetters and 
take yourself to the place of the rising light and thus you rush 
toward each other he believed he could simply capture the sun 
and encountered the worm of the shadows you thought that in 
the east you could drink from the source of the light and catch 
the horned giant before whom you fall to your knees his essence 
is blind excessive longing and tempestuous force my essence is 
seeing limitation and the incapacity of cleverness he possesses in 
abundance what i lack consequently i will also not let him go 
the bull god who once wounded jacobs hip and whom i have 
now lamed i want to make his force my own 
it is therefore prudent to keep alive the severely afflicted so 
that his force continues to support me we miss nothing more 
than divine force we say yes indeed this is how it should or 
could be this or that should be achieved we speak thus and 
stand thus and look about us embarrassed to see whether some
how something will occur and should something happen we 
look on and say yes indeed we understand it is this or that 
or it is similar to this or that and thus we speak and stand 
and look around to see whether somewhere something might 
happen something always happens but we do not happen 
since our god is sick we have seen him dead with the venomous 
gaze of the basilisk on his face and we have understood that he 
is dead we must think of his healing and yet again i feel it 
quite clearly that my life would have broken in half had i failed to 
heal my god hence i abided with him in the long cold night

 st sebastian was a christian martyr persecuted by the romans who lived in the third century he was often depicted tied to a tree and shot with arrows the earliest 
such representation is in the basilica sanfapollinaire nuova in ravenna 
 this refers to hebrews  it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living god 
 this refers to jacobs wrestling with the angel in genesis  and jacob was left alone and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day and 
when he saw that he prevailed not against him he touched the hollow of his thigh and the hollow of jacobs thigh was out of joint as he wrestled with him and he 
said let me go for the day breaketh and he said i will not let thee go except thou bless me and he said unto him what is thy name and he said jacob and he 
said thy name shall be called no more jacob but israel for as a prince hast thou power with god and with men and hast prevailed and jacob asked him and said 
tell me i pray thee thy name and he said wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name and he blessed him there

  i liber secundus  
izdubar and i do not want him to wither away miserably but 
where should help come from no one will travel the hotcold 
path and i i am afraid to return to that path and in the east 
was there possibly help there but what about the unlmown 
dangers that loomed there i do not want to go blind what use 
would that be to izdubar i cannot carry this lamed one as a 
blind man either yes if i were powerful like izdubar wha use 
is science here 
toward evening i went up to izdubar and spoke to him izdubar 
my prince listen i will not let you decline the second evening is 
falling we have no food and we are bound to die if i cannot find 
help we cannot expect any help from the west but help is possible 
from the east did you meet anyone on your way whom we could 
calion for help 
iz let it be may death come when it will 
 my heart bleeds at the thought of leaving you here without 
having done the upmost to help you 
iz what help is your magical power to you if you were strong 
as i am you could carry me but your poison can only destroy and 
not help 
 if we were in my land swift wagons could bring us help 
iz if we were in my land your poisoned barb would not have 
reached me 
 tell me do you know of no help from the side of the east 
iz the way there is long and lonely and when you reach the 
plains after crossing the mountains you will meet the powerful 
sun which will blind you 
i but what if i wandered by night and if i sheltered from the 
sun during the day 
iz in the night all the serpents and dragons crawl out of their 
holes and you unarmed will inevitably fall victim to them let it 
be how would this help my legs have withered and are numb 
i prefer not to bring home the booty of this journey 
 should i not risk everything 
iz useless nothing is gained if you die 
i let me think it over a bit perhaps a saving thought will yet 
come to me 
i withdraw and sit down on a rock high above on the ridge of 
the mountain and this speech began in me great izdubar you 
are in a hopeless positionand i no lessiiwhat can be done it 
is not always necessary to act sometimes thinking is better i am 
basically convinced that izdubar is hardly real in the ordinary sense 
but is a fantasy it would help if the situation were considered 
from another angle  considered  considered  it is remarkable 
that even here thoughts echo one must be quite alone but this 
will hardly last he will of course not accept that he is a fantasy 
but instead claim that he is completely real and that he can only 
be helped in a real way nevertheless it would be worth trying this 
means once i will appeal to him 
 my prince powerful one listen a thought came to me 
that might save us i think that you are not at all real but only 
a fantasy 
iz i am terrified by this thought it is murderous do you 
even mean to declare me unreal  now that you have lamed 
me so pitifully 
ii the drqft continues thus spoke another voice in me like an echo p  i perhaps i have not made myself clear enough and have 
spoken too much in the language of the western lands i do not 
mean to say that you are not real at all of course but only as real 
as a fantasy if you could accept this much would be gained 
iz what would be gained by this you are a tormenting devil 
 pitiful one i will not torment you the hand of the doctor 
does not seek to torment even if it causes grief can you really not 
accept that you are a fantasy 
iz woe betide me in what magic do you want to entangle 
me should it help me if i take myself for a fantasy 
i you know that the name one bears means a lot you also 
know that one often gives the sick new names to heal them for 
with the new name they come by a new essence your name is 
your essence 
iz you are right our priests also say this 
 so are you prepared to admit that you are a fantasy 
iz if it helpsyes 
the inner voice now spoke to me as follows while admittedly 
he is a fantasy now the situation remains extremely complex 
a fantasy cannot be simply negated and treated with resignation 
either it calls for action anyway he is a fantasyand thus 
considerably more volatile i think i can see a way forward i can 
take him on my back for now i went to izdubar and said to him 
 way has been found you have become light lighter than 
a feather now i can carry you i put my arms round him and 
lift him up from the ground he is lighter than air and i struggle to 
keep my feet on the ground since my load lifts me up into the air 
iz that was a masterstroke where are you carrying me 
 i am going to carry you down into the western land my 
comrades will happily accommodate such a large fantasy once 
we have crossed the mountains and have reached the houses of 
hospitable men i can calmly go about finding a means to restore 
you completely again 
carrying him on my back i climb down the small rock path 
with great care more in danger of being whirled aloft by the wind 
than of losing balance because of my load and plunging down the 
mountainside i hang on to my all too lightweight load finally we 
reach the bottom of the valley and the way of the hot and cold 
pain but this time i am blown by a whistling east wind down 
through the narrow rocks and across the fields toward inhabited 
places making no contact with the painful way spurred on i 
hasten through beautiful lands i see two people ahead of me 
ammonius and the red one when we are right behind them 
they turn round and run off into the fields with horrified cries i 
must have proved a strange sight indeed 
iz who are these misshapen ones are these your comrades 
i these are not men they are socalled relics of the past 
which one still often encounters in the western lands they used 
tobe very important theyre now used mostly as shepherds 
iz what a wondrous country but look isnt that a town 
dont you want to go there 
 no god forbid i dont want a crowd to gather since the 
enlightened live there cant you smell them theyre actually 
dangerous since they cook the strongest poisons from which even 
i must protect myself the people there are totally paralyzed

 wrapped in a brown poisonous vapor and can only move with 
artificial means  but you need not worry night has almost 
fallen and no one will see us moreover no one would admit to 
having seen me i know an out of the way house here i have close 
friends there who will take us in for the night 
izdubar and i come to a quiet dark garden and a secluded 
house i hide izdubar under the drooping branches of a tree go 
up to the door of the house and knock i ponder the door it is 
much too small i will never be able to get izdubar through it 
yeta fantasy takes up no space why did this excellent thought 
not occur to me earlier i return to the garden and with no 
difficulty squeeze izdubar into the size of an egg and put him in 
my pocket then i walk into the welcoming house where izdubar 
should find healing 
 hi il thus my god found salvation he was saved 
precisely by what one would actually consider fatal namely by 
declaring him a figment of the imagination how often has it 
been assumed that the gods have been brought to their end in 
this wayiis this was obviously a serious mistalce since this was 
precisely what saved the god he did not pass away but became 
a living fantasy whose workings i could feel on my own body my 
inherent heaviness faded and the hot and cold way of pain no 
longer burned and froze my soles the weight no longer kept me 
pressed to the ground but instead the wind carried me lightly 
like a feather while i carried the giant ii 
one used to believe that one could murder a god but the 
god was saved he forged a new axe in the fire and plunged again 
into the flood of light of the east to resume his ancient cycleil 
but we clever men crept around lamed and poisoned and did not 
even know that we lacked something but i loved my god and 
took him to the house of men since i was convinced that he also 
really lived as a fantasy and should therefore not be left behind 
wounded and sick and hence i experienced the miracle of my 
body losing its heaviness when i burdened myself with the god 
st christopher the giant bore his burden with difficulty 
despite the fact that he bore only the christ childilb but i was 
as small as a child and bore a giant and yet my burden lifted 
me up the christ child became an easy burden for the giant 
christopher since christ himself said my yoke is sweet and my 
burden is lightil we should not bear christ as he is unbearable 
but we should be christs for then our yoke is sweet and our 
burden easy this tangible and apparent world is one reality but 
fantasy is the other reality so long as we leave the god outside us 
apparent and tangible he is unbearable and hopeless but if we 
turn the god into fantasy he is in us and is easy to bear the god 
outside us increases the weight of everything heavy while the 
god within us lightens everything heavy hence all christophers 
have stooped backs and short breath since the world is heavy second day i  
hi  many have wanted to get help for their sick god 
and were then devoured by the serpents and dragons lurking on 
the way to the land of the sun they perished in the overbright 
day and have become dark men since their eyes have been 
blinded now they go around like shadows and speak of the light 
but see little but their god is in everything that they do not see 
he is in the dark western lands and he sharpens seeing eyes and 
he assists those cooking the poison and he guides serpents to 
the heels of the blind perpetrators therefore if you are clever 
talce the god with you then you know where he is if you do 
not have him with you in the western lands he will come 
running to you t night with clanking armor and a crushing 
battle axe if you do not have him with you in the land of the 
dawn then you will step unawares on the divine worm who 
awaits your unsuspecting heel  
hi  you gain everything from the god whom you bear 
but not his weapon since he crushed it he who conquers needs 
weapons but what else do you want to conquer you cannot 
conquer more than the earth and what is the earth it is round 
allover and hangs like a drop in the cosmos you will not reach 
the sun and your power will not even extend to the barren moon 
you will conquer neither the sea nor the snow on the poles nor 
the sands of the desert but only a few spots on the green earth 
you will not conquer anything for any length of time your power 
will turn into dust tomorrow for above allat the very east
you must conquer death so do not be a fool throw down your 
weapon god himself smashed his weapon armor is enough 
to protect you from fools who still suffer from the need to 
conquer gods armor will make you invulnerable and invisible 
to the worst fools 
take your god with you bear him down to your dark land 
where people live who rub their eyes each morning and yet always 
see only the same thing and never anything else bring your god 
down to the haze pregnant with poison but not like those blinded 
ones who try to illuminate the darkness with lanterns which it does 
not comprehend instead secretly carry your god to a hospitable 
roof the huts of men are small and they cannot welcome the 
god despite their hospitality and willingness hence do not wait 
until rawly bungling hands of men hack your god to pieces but 
embrace him again lovingly until he has talcen on the form of his 
first beginning let no human eye see the much loved terribly 
splendid one in the state of his illness and lack of power consider 
that your fellow men are animals without knowing it so long as 
they go to pasture or lie in the sun or suckle their young or mate 
with each other they are beautiful and harmless creatures of dark 
mother earth but if the god appears they begin to rave since 
the nearness of god makes people rave they tremble with fear 
ii this refers to a scene in the text describing how jung reduced izdubar to the size of an egg so he could secretly carry izdubar into the house and enable his healing 
jung said to aniela jaffe concerning these sections that some of the fantasies were driven by fear such as the chapter on the devil and the chapter on gilgamesh izdubar 
from one perspective it was stupid that he had to find a way to help the giant but he felt that ifhe didnt do so he would have failed he paid for the ridiculous solution 
through realizing that he had captured a god many of these fantasies were a hellish combination of the sublime and the ridiculous mp p  
ii in the drift this sentence reads like many other gods and on numerous previous occasions the god was declared to be a fantasy and it was thus assumed that he 
had been dealt with p 
ii the drift continues we men apparently believed that there is no such thing as a fantasy and if we declared something to be fantastic then it would be well and truly 
destroyed p  in i jung commented on the contemporary dispargement of fantasy the development of the personality cw i  
ii this seems to refer to the following chapter 
ii st christopher greek for christ bearer was a martyr in the third century according to legend he had sought a hermit to inquire as to how he could serve jesus 
the hermit suggested he help carry people across a dangerous crossing in a river which he did on one occasion a small child asked to be taken across he found that 
the child was heavier than anyone else and the child revealed himself to be christ bearing the sins of the world

and we found you in the egg image  j  
i have slain a precious human sacrifice for you 
a youth and old man 
i have cut my skin with a knife the incantations i  
i have sprinkled your altar with my own blood 
i have banished my father and mother so that you can live with me 
i have turned my night into day and went about at midday 
like a sleepwalker 
i have overthrown all the gods broken the laws eaten the impure 
i have thrown down my sword and dressed in womens clothing 
i shattered my firm castle and played like a child in the sand 
i saw warriors form into line of battle and i destroyed my suit of armor 
with a hammer 
i planted my field and let the fruit decay 
i made small everything that was great and made everything great 
that was small 
i exchanged my furthest goal for the nearest and so i am ready 
image iji 
 hi  j however i am not ready since i have still not accepted 
that which chokes my heart that fearful thing is the enclosing of 
the god in the egg i am happy that the great endeavor has been 
successful but my fear made me forget the hazards involved i 
love and admire the powerful no one is greater than he with the 
bulls horns and yet i lamed carried and made him smaller with 
ease i almost slumped to the ground with fear when i saw him 
and now i rescue him with a cupped hand these are the powers 
that make you afraid and conquer you these have been your gods 
and your rulers since time immemorial yet you can put them in 
your pocket what is blasphemy compared to this i would like to be 
able to blaspheme against the god that way i would at least have 
a god whom i could insult but it is not worth blaspheming against 
an egg that one carries in ones pocket that is a god against 
whom one cannot even blaspheme 
i hated this pitifulness of the god my own unworthiness 
is already enough it cannot bear my encumbering it with the 
pitifulness of the god nothing stands firm you touch yourself 
and you turn to dust you touch the god and he hides terrified in 
the egg you force the gates of hell the sound of cackling masks 
and the music of fools approaches you you storm heaven stage 
scenery totters and the prompter in the box falls into a swoon you 
notice you are not true it is not true above it is not true below 
left and right are deceptions wherever you grasp is air air air 
but i have caught him he who has been feared since time 
immemorial i have made him small and my hand surrounds him 
that is the demise of the gods man puts them in his pocket 
that is the end of the story of the gods nothing remains of 
the gods other than an egg and i possess this egg perhaps i 
can eradicate this last one and with this finally exterminate the 
race of gods now that i know that the gods have yielded to my 
powerwhat are the gods to me now old and overripe they 
have fallen and been buried in an egg 
but how did this happen i felled the great one i mourned 
him i did not want to leave him since i loved him because no

valley on whose rim i am standing on the opposite side i know that i must take flight up the mountain to avoid the dreadful catastrophe this dream is explained

about the current formation of huge sunspots p  the following is a paraphrase of the entry in black book  for january  jung asks what it is that fills him 
with fear and horror what is falling down from the high mountain his soul tells him to help the gods and to sacrifice to them she tells him that the worm crawls up 
to heaven it begins to cover the stars and with a tongue of fire he eats the dome of the seven blue heavens she tells him that he will also be eaten and that he should 
crawl into the stone and wait in the narrow casing until the torrent of fire is over snow falls from the mountains because the fiery breath falls down from above the 
clouds the god is coming jung should get ready to receive him jung should hide himself in stone as the god is a terrible fire he should remain quiet and look 
within so that the god does not consume him in flames pf

mortal being rivals him out oflove i devised the trick that relieved 
him of heaviness and freed him from the confines of space i took

one whom i loved should i shatter the delicate shell of his 
grave and expose him to the weightlessness and unboundedness 
of the winds of the world but did i not sing the incantations 
for his incubation did i not do this out of love for him why do 
i love him i do not want to tear the love for the great one from

are we not sons of the gods why should gods not be our 
children if my father the god should die a god child should arise 
from my maternal heart since i love the god and do not want to 
leave him only he who loves the god can make him fall and the 
god submits to his vanquisher and nestles in his hand and dies in 
the heart of him who loves him and promises him birth 
my god i love you as a mother loves the unborn whom she carries in 
her heart grow in the egg of the east nourish yourself from my love drink 
the juice of my life so that you will become a radiant god we need your light 
oh child since we go in darkness light up our paths may your light shine 
before us may your fire warm the coldness of our life we do not need your 
power but life 
 what does power avail us we do not want to rule we want to 
live we want light and warmth and hence we need yours just as 
the greening earth and every living body needs the sun so we as

hi  n the evening of the third day i kneel down on the rug and 
carefully open the egg something resembling smoke rises up from it 
and suddenly izdubar is standing before me enormous transformed and 
complete his limbs are whole and lfind no trace of damage on them its as 
ifhe had awokenfrom a deep sleep he says where am ir how narrow it is here how dark how coolam i 
in the graver where was i r it seemed to me as if i had been outside in the 
universeover and under me was an endlessly dark starglittering sky
and i was in a passion of unspeakable yearning 
streams of fire broke from my radiating body
i surged through blazingjfames
i swam in a sea that wrapped me in livingfires
full of light full of longing full of eternity
i was ancient and perpetually renewing myself
f allingfrom the heights to the depths 
and whirled glowingfrom the depths to the heights
hovering around myself amidst glowing clouds
as raining embers beating down like the foam of the suif engulfing 
 myself in stiffing heat
embracing and rejecting myself in a boundless game
where was i r i was completely sun  
i oh izdubar divine one how wonderful you are healed 
healedr was i ever sickr who speaks ofsicknessr i was sun completely 
sun i am the sun 
an inexpressible light breaks from his body a light that my 
eyes cannot grasp i must cover my face and cast my gaze to 
the ground 
i you are the sun the eternal lightmost powerful one 
forgive me for carrying you 
everything is quiet and dark i look around me the empty 
egg shell is lying on the rug i feel myself the floor the walls 
everything is as usual utterly plain and utterly real i would like 
to say that everything around me has turned to gold but it is not 
trueeverything is as it always has been here reigned eternal 
light immeasurable and overpowering 
 hi  it happened that i opened the egg and that the god 
left the egg he was healed and his figure shone transformed 
and i knelt like a child and could not grasp the miracle he who 
had been pressed into the core of the beginning rose up and no 
trace of illness could be found on him and when i thought that 
i had caught the mighty one and held him in my cupped hands 
he was the sun itself 
 in dreams jung noted on february  started work on the opening of the egg image p  this indicates that the image depicts the regeneration of 
izdubar from the egg concerning the solar barge in this image cf image

 the draft has instead third day p 
 january   in black book  jung wrote it appears as if something has been achieved through this memorable event but it is incalculable where this will all lead 
i hardly dare say that izdubars fate is grotesque and tragic for that is what our most precious life is fr th vischers auch einer is the first attempt to elevate 
this truth to a system he rightly deserves a place among the immortal what lies in the middle is the truth it has many faces one is certainly comical another sad a 
third evil a fourth tragic a fifth funny a sixth is a grimace and so forth should one of these faces become particularly obtrusive we thus recognize that we have devi
ated from certain truth and approach an extreme that constitutes a definite impasse should we decide to pursue this route it is a murderous task to write the wisdom 
of real life particularly if one has committed many years to serious scientific research what proves to be most difficult is to grasp the playfulness of life the childish 
so to speak all the manifold sides of life the great the beautiful the serious the black the devilish the good the ridiculous the grotesque are fields of application 
which each tend to wholly absorb the beholder or describer  our time requires something capable of regulating the mind just as the concrete world has expanded 
from the limitedness of the ancient outlook to the immeasurable diversity of our modern outlook the world of intellectual possibilities has developed to unfathomable 
diversity infinitely long paths paved with thousands of thick volumes lead from one specialization to another soon no one will be able to walk down these paths 
anymore and then only specialists will remain more than ever we require the living truth of the life of the mind of something capable of providing firm guidance

 i wandered toward the east where the sun rises i probably 
wanted to rise too as if i were the sun i wanted to embrace 
the sun and rise with it into daybreak but it came toward me 
and stood in my way it told me that i had no chance of reaching 
the beginning but i lamed the one who wanted to rush down 
in order to set with the sun in the womb of the night he was 
deprived of all hope of reaching the blessed western lands 
but behold i caught the sun without realizing it and carried 
it in my hand he who wanted to go down with the sun found 
me through his downgoing i became his nocturnal mother who 
incubated the egg of the beginning and he rose up renewed 
reborn to greater splendor 
while he rises however i go down when i conquered the 
god his force streamed into me but when the god rested in 
the egg and awaited his beginning my force went into him and 
when he rose up radiantly i lay on my face he took my life with 
him all my force was now in him my soul swam like a fish in his 
sea of fire but i lay in the frightful cool of the shadows of the 
earth and sanle down deeper and deeper to the lowest darkness 
all light had left me the god rose in the eastern lands and i fell 
into the horror of the underworld i lay there like a childbearer 
cruelly mauled and bleeding her life into the child uniting life 
and death in a dying glance the days mother the nights prey my 
god had torn me apart terribly he had drunk the juice of my life 
he had drunk my highest power into him and became marvelous and 
strong like the sun an unblemished god who bore no stigma or 
flaw he had taken my wings from me he had robbed me of the 
swelling force of my muscles and the power of my will disappeared 
with him he left me powerless and groaning 
 i did not know what was happening to me since simply 
everything powerful beautiful blissful and superhuman had 
leaked from my maternal womb none of the radiant gold remained 
cruelly and unthinkably the sunbird spread its wings and flew up 
into infinite space i was left with the broken shells and the 
miserable casing of his beginning the emptiness of the depths 
opened beneath me 
woe betide the mother who gives birth to a god if she gives 
birth to a wounded and painstricken god a sword will pierce 
her soul but if she gives birth to an unblemished god then hell will 
open to her from which monstrous serpents will rise convulsively 
to suffocate the mother with miasma birth is difficult but a 
thousand times more difficult is the hellish afterbirth all the 
dragons and monstrous serpents of eternal emptiness follow 
behind the divine son 
what remains of human nature when the god has become 
mature and has seized all power everything incompetent every
thing powerless everything eternally vulgar everything adverse 
and unfavorable everything reluctant diminishing exterminating 
everything absurd everything that the unfathomable night of 
matter encloses in itself that is the afterbirth of the god and his 
hellish and dreadfully deformed brother 
the god suffers when man does not accept his darkness 
consequently men must have a suffering god so long as they 
suffer from evil to suffer from evil means you still love evil and 
yet love it no longer you still hope to gain something but you 
do not want to look closely for fear that you might discover that 
you stillove evil the god suffers because you continue to suffer 
from loving evil you do not suffer from evil because you recognize 
it but because it affords you secret pleasure and because you 
believe it promises the pleasure of an unlrnown opportunity 
 in the next chapter jung finds himself in hell the opening of the egg i  
so long as your god suffers you have sympathy with him and 
with yourself you thus spare your hell and prolong his suffering 
if you want to malee him well without engaging in secret sympathy 
with yourself evil puts a spoke in your wheelthe evil whose form 
you generally recognize but whose hellish strength in yourself 
you do not know your unlrnowing stems from the previous 
harmlessness of your life from the peaceful passage of time and 
from the absence of the god but if the god draws near your 
essence starts to seethe and the black mud of the depths whirls up 
man stands between emptiness and fullness if his strength 
combines with fullness it becomes fully formative there is always 
something good about such formation if his strength combines 
with emptiness it has a dissolving and destructive effect since 
emptiness can never be formed but only strives to satisfy itself at 
the cost of fullness combined thus human force turns empti
ness into evil if your force shapes fullness it does so because of 
its association with fullness but to ensure that your formation 
continues to exist it must remain tied to your strength through 
constant shaping you gradually lose your force since ultimately 
all force is associated with the shapeliness that has been given 
form ultimately where you mistaleenly imagine that you are 
rich you have actually become poor and you stand amidst your 
forms like a beggar that is when the blinded man is seized by 
an increasing desire to give shape to things since he believes 
that manifold increased formation will satisfy his i desire 
because he has spent his force he becomes desirous he begins 
to compel others into his service and takes their force to pursue 
his own designs 
in this moment you need evil when you notice that your 
strength is coming to an end and desire sets in you must withdraw 
it from what has been formed into your emptiness through this 
association with the emptiness you will succeed in dissolving the 
formation in you you will thus regain your freedom in that you 
have saved your strength from oppressive association with the 
object so long as you persist with the standpoint of the good 
you cannot dissolve your formation precisely because it is what 
is good you cannot dissolve good with good you can dissolve 
good only with evil for your good also leads ultimately to death 
through its progressive binding of your force by progressively 
binding your force you are entirely unable to live without evil 
your shaping first produces an image of your formation within 
you this image remains in you and  it is the first and 
unmediated expression of your shaping it then produces precisely 
through this image an outer one which can exist without you 
and outlive you your strength is not directly linked to your 
outer formation but only through the image that remains in you 
when you set about dissolving your formation with evil you do 
not destroy the outer shape or else you would be destroying your 
own work but what you do destroy is the image that you have 
formed in yourself for it is this image that clings to your force 
you will need evil to dissolve your formation and to free yourself 
from the power of what has been to the same extent which this 
image fetters your strength 
hence their formation causes many good persons to bleed to 
death because they cannot attend to evil in the same measure 
the better one is and the more attached one is to ones formation 
the more one will lose ones force but what happens when the 
good person has lost their force completely to their formation 
not only will they seek to force others into the service of their 
formation with unconscious cunning and power but they will

also become bad in their goodness without knowing it since their 
longing for satisfaction and strengthening will male them more 
and more selfish but because of this the good ones will ultimately 
destroy their own work and all those whom they forced into the 
service of their own work will become their enemies because they 
will have alienated them but you will also secretly begin to hate 
whoever alienates you from yourself against your own wishes 
even if this were in the best interest of things unfortunately the 
good person who has bound his strength will all too easily find 
slaves for his service since there are more than plenty who yearn 
for nothing more strongly than to be alienated from themselves 
under a good pretext 
you suffer from evil because you love it secretly and are unaware 
of your love you wish to escape your predicament and you begin 
to hate evil and once more you are bound to evil through your 
hate since whether you love or hate it it makes no difference you 
are bound to evil evil is to be accepted what we want remains 
in our hands what we do not want and yet is stronger than us 
sweeps us away and we cannot stop it without damaging ourselves 
for our force remains in evil thus we probably have to accept 
our evil without love and hate recognizing that it exists and must 
have its share in life in doing so we can deprive it of the power 
it has to overwhelm us 
when we have succeeded in making a god and if through 
this creation our whole force has entered into this design we are 
filled with an overwhelming desire to rise with the divine sun and 
to become a part of its magnificence but we forget that we are 
then no more than hollow forms since giving form to god has 
sapped us completely we are not only poor but have become 
sluggish matter throughout which would never be entitled to 
share in divinity 
like a terrible suffering or an inescapable devilish persecution 
the misery and neediness of our matter creeps up on us the 
powerless matter begins to suckle and would like to swallow its 
shape back into itself again but since we are always enamored of 
our own design we believe that the god calls us to him and we 
male desperate attempts to follow the god into the higher realm 
or we turn preachingly and demandingly to our fellow men to at 
any rate force others into following the god unfortunately there 
are men who allow themselves to be persuaded into doing this to 
their and our detriment 
much undoing resides in this urge since who could suspect that 
he who has made the god is himself condemned to hell but this 
is the way it is because the matter that is stripped of the divine 
radiance of force is empty and dark if the god alights from matter 
we feel the emptiness of matter as one part of endless empty space 
through haste and increased willing and action we want to 
escape from emptiness and also from evil but the right way is 
that we accept emptiness destroy the image of the form within 
us negate the god and descend into the abyss and awfulness of 
matter the god as our work stands outside us and no longer 
needs our help he is created and remains left to his own devices 
a created work that perishes again immediately once we turn 
away from it is not worth anything even if it  were a god but where is the god after his creation and after his separation 
from me if you build a house you see it standing in the outer 
world when you have created a god whom you cannot see with 
your own eyes then he is in the spiritual world that is no less 
valuable than the outer physical world he is there and does 
everything for you and others that you would expect from a god 
thus your soul is your own self in the spiritual world as the 
abode of the spirits however the spiritual world is also an outer 
world just as you are also not alone in the visible world but are 
surrounded by objects that belong to you and obey only you you 
also have thoughts that belong to you and obey only you but just 
as you are surrounded in the visible world by things and beings 
that neither belong to you nor obey you you are also surrounded 
in the spiritual world by thoughts and beings of thought that 
neither obey you nor belong to you just as you engender or bear 
your physical children and just as they grow up and separate 
themselves from you to live their own fate you also produce or 
give birth to beings of thought which separate themselves from 
you and live their own lives just as we leave our children when we 
grow old and give our body back to the earth i separate myself 
from my god the sun and sink into the emptiness of matter and 
obliterate the image of my child in me this happens in that i 
accept the nature of matter and allow the force of my form to flow 
into emptiness just as i gave birth anew to the sick god through 
my engendering force i henceforth animate the emptiness of 
matter from which the formation of evil grows 
nature is playful and terrible some see the playful side and dally with it 
and let it sparkle others see the horror and cover their heads and are more 
dead than alive the way does not lead between both but embraces both it 
is both cheeiful play and cold horror image   image

 the most extreme despair and succeeded in piercing the eye of 
the evil one with the little hook ifhe moves she will tear out his 
eye with a final jerk the horror paralyzes me what will happen 
a voice spealcs 
the evil one cannot make a sacrifice he cannot sacrifice his eye victory 
is with the one who can sacrifice  
 the vision vanished i saw that my soul had fallen into the 
power of abysmal evil the power of evil is unquestionable and 
we rightfully fear it here no prayers no pious words no magical 
sayings help once raw power comes after you there is no help 
once evil seizes you without pity no father no mother no right 
no wall and tower no armor and protective power come to your 
aid you fall powerless and forlorn into the hand of the superior 
power of evil in this battle you are all alone because i wanted to 
give birth to my god i also wanted evil he who wants to create 
an eternal fullness will also create eternal emptinessl you cannot 
undertake one without the other but if you want to escape evil 
you will create no god everything that you do is tepid and gray 
i wanted my god for the sake of grace and disgrace hence i also 
want my evil if my god were not overpowering neither would 
be my evil but i want my god to be powerful and beyond all 
measure happy and lustrous only in this way do i love my god 
and the luster of his beauty will also have me taste the very 
bottom of hell 
my god rose in the eastern sky brighter than the heavenly 
host and brought about a new day for all the peoples this is why 
i want to go to hell would a mother not want to give up her life 
for her child how much easier would it be to give up my life if 
only my god could overcome the torment of the last hour of the 
night and victoriously break through the red mist of the morning 
i do not doubt i also want evil for the salce of my god i enter 
the unequal battle since it is always unequal and without doubt 
a lost cause how terrible and despairing would this battle be 
otherwise but precisely this is how it should and will be 
 nothing is more valuable to the evil one than his eye since 
only through his eye can emptiness seize gleaming fullness 
because the emptiness lacks fullness it craves fullness and its 
shining power and it drinks it in by means of its eye which is 
able to grasp the beauty and unsullied radiance of fullness the 
emptiness is poor and if it lacked its eye it would be hopeless 
it sees the most beautiful and wants to devour it in order to 
spoil it the devil knows what is beautiful and hence he is 
the shadow of beauty and follows it everywhere awaiting the 
moment when the beautiful writhing great with child seeks to 
give life to the god 
if your beauty grows the dreadful worm will also creep up 
you waiting for its prey nothing is sacred to him except his eye 
with which he sees the most beautiful he will never give up his 
eye he is invulnerable but nothing protects his eye it is delicate 
and clear adept at drinking in the eternal light it wants you the 
bright red light of your life hell i  
i recognize the fearful devilishness of human nature i cover 
my eyes before it i put out my hand to fend it of if anyone wants 
to approach me for fear that my shadow could fallon him or his 
shadow could fallon me since i also see the devilish in him who 
is the harmless companion of his shadow 
no one touches me death and crime lie in wait for you and 
me you smile innocently my friend dont you see that a gentle 
flickering of your eye betrays the frightfulness whose unsuspect
ing messenger you are your bloodthirsty tiger growls softly your 
poisonous serpent hisses secretly while you conscious only of 
your goodness offer your human hand to me in greeting i know 
your shadow and mine that follows and comes with us and only 
waits for the hour of twilight when he will strangle you and me 
with all the daimons of the night 
what abyss of blooddripping history separates you from me 
i grasped your hand and looked at you i lay my head in your lap 
and felt the living warmth of your body on mine as if it were my 
own bodyand suddenly i felt a smooth cord around my neck 
which choked me mercilessly and a cruel hammer blow struck a 
nail into my temple i was dragged by my feet along the pavement 
and wild hounds gnawed my body in the lonely night 
no one should be astonished that men are so far removed 
from one another that they cannot understand one another 
that they wage war and kill one another one should be much more 
surprised that men believe they are close understand one another 
and love one another two things are yet to be discovered the 
first is the infinite gulf that separates us from one another the 
second is the bridge that could connect us have you considered 
how much unsuspected animality human company makes possible 
swhen my soul fell into the hands of evil it was defenseless 
except for the weak fishing rod which it could use again with its 
power to pull the fish from the sea of emptiness the eye of the 
evil one sucked in all the force of my soul only its will remained 
which is just that small fish hook i wanted evil since i realized 
that i was not able to elude it and because i wanted evil my soul 
held the precious hook in its hand that was supposed to strike the 
vulnerable place of the evil one he who does not want evil will

 i liber secundus  
look back and regret nothing you see many near you fall you 
feel compassion but you should live your life since then at least 
one in a thousand will remain you cannot halt dying 
but why did my soul not tear out the eye of the evil one the 
evil one has many eyes and losing one amounts to losing none 
but if she had done it she would have come completely under the 
spell of the evil one the evil one can only fail to make sacrifice 
you should not harm him above all not his eye since the most 
beautiful would not exist if the evil one did not see it and long for 
it the evil one is holy 
there is nothing the emptiness can sacrifice since it always 
suffers lack only fullness can sacrifice since it has fullness 
emptiness cannot sacrifice its hunger for fullness since it cannot 
deny its own essence therefore we also need evil but i can 
sacrifice my will to evil because i previously received fullness all 
strength flows back to me again since the evil one has destroyed 
the image i had of the formation of the god but the image of 
the gods formation in me was not yet destroyed i dread this 
destruction since it is terrible an unprecedented desecration of 
temples everything in me strives against this abysmal abomination 
for i still did not know what it means to give birth to a god

cap xiii 
hi  but this was the vision that i did not want to see the 
horror that i did not want to live a sickening feeling of nausea 
sneaks up on me and abominable perfidious serpents wind their 
way slowly and cracklingly through parched undergrowth they 
hang down lazily and disgustingly lethargic from the branches 
looped in dreadful knots i am reluctant to enter this dreary and 
unsightly valley where the bushes stand in arid stony defiles the 
valley looks so normal its air smells of crime of foul cowardly 
deeds i am seized by disgust and horror i walk hesitantly over 
the boulders avoiding every dark place for fear of treading on a 
serpent the sun shines weakly out of a gray and distant sky and 
all the leaves are shriveled a marionette with a broken head lies 
before me amidst the stonesa few steps further a small apron
and then behind the bush the body of a small girlcovered with 
terrible woundssmeared with blood one foot is clad with a 
stocking and shoe the other is nalced and gorily crushedthe 
head where is the head the head is a mash of blood with hair 
and whitish pieces of bone surrounded by stones smeared with 
brain and blood my gaze is captivated by this awful sighta 
shrouded figure like that of a woman is standing calmly next to 
the child her face is covered by an impenetrable veil she asks me 
s what then do you say 
i what should i say this is beyond words 
s do you understand this 
i i refuse to understand such things i cant speak about 
them without becoming enraged 
 the handwrittelt drqft has instead eighth adveltture p  s why become enraged you might as well rage every day of 
your life for these and similar things occur every day 
i but most of the time we dont see them 
s so knowing that they happen is not enough to enrage you 
i if i merely have knowledge of something its easier and 
simpler the horror is less real if all i have is knowledge 
s step nearer and you will see that the body of the child has 
been cut open talce out the liver 
i i will not touch this corpse if someone witnessed this they 
would think that im the murderer 
s you are cowardly talce out the liver 
i why should i do this this is absurd 
s i want you to remove the liver you must do it 
i who are you to give me such an order 
s i am the soul of this child you must do this for my sake 
 i dont understand but ill believe you and do this horrific 
and absurd deed  
i reach into the childs visceral cavityit is still warmthe 
liver is still firmly attached  i talce my knife and cut it free of 
the ligaments then i take it out and hold it with bloody hands 
toward the figure 
s i thank you 
i what should i do 
s you know what the liver means and you ought to perform 
the healing act with it 
i what is to be done 
s take a piece of the liver in place of the whole and eat it 
i what are you demanding this is absolute madness this is 
desecration necrophilia you make me a guilty party to this most 
hideous of all crimes 
s you have devised the most horrible torment for the 
murderer which could atone for his act there is only one 
atonement abase yourself and eat 
i i cannot i refuse i cannot participate in this 
horrible guilt 
s you share in this guilt 
i i share in this guilt 
s you are a man and a man has committed this deed 
i yes i am a mani curse whoever did this for being a man 
and i curse myself for being a man 
s so take part in his act abase yourself and eat i need 
atonement 
i so shall it be for your sake as you are the soul of this child 
i kneel down on the stone cut off a piece of the liver and 
put it in my mouth my gorge risestears burst from my eyes

   the sacrifice has been accomplished the divine child the 
image of the gods formation is slain and i have eaten from 
the sacrificial flesh the child that is the image of the gods 
formation not only bore my human craving but also enclosed 
all the primordial and elemental powers that the sons of the 
sun possess as an inalienable inheritance the god needs all 
this for his genesis but when he has been created and hastens 
away into unending space we need the gold of the sun we must 
regenerate ourselves but as the creation of a god is a creative 
act of highest love the restoration of our human life signifies an 
act of the below this is a great and dark mystery man cannot 
accomplish this act solely by himself but is assisted by evil which 
does it instead of man but man must recognize his complicity in 
the act of evil he must bear witness to this recognition by eating 
from the bloody sacrificial flesh through this act he testifies that 
he is a man that he recognizes good as well as evil and that he 
destroys the image of the gods formation through withdraw
ing his life force with which he also dissociates himself from the 
god this occurs for the salvation of the soul which is the true 
mother of the divine child  
when it bore and gave birth to the god my soul was of human 
nature throughout it possessed the primordial powers since time 
immemorial but only in a dormant condition they flowed into 
forming the god without my help but through the sacrificial 
murder i redeemed the primordial powers and added them to 
my soul since they became part of a living pattern they are no 
longer dormant but awake and active and irradiate my soul 
with their divine working through this it receives a divine attri
bute hence the eating of the sacrificial flesh aided its healing 
the ancients have also indicated this to us in that they taught us 
to drink the blood and eat the flesh of the savior the ancients 
believed that this brought healing to the soul 
there are not many truths there are only a few their meaning 
is too deep to grasp other than in symbols 
a god who is no stronger than man what is he you still 
should taste holy dread how would you be worthy of enjoying 
the wine and the bread if you have not touched the black bottom 
of human nature hence you are lukewarm and pale shadows the sacridcal murder i  
proud of your shallow coastlines and broad country roads but 
the floodgates will be opened there are inexorable things from 
which only god can save you 
the primordial force is the radiance of the sun which the 
sons of the sun have carried in themselves for aeons and pass on 
to their children but if the soul dips into radiance she becomes 
as remorseless as the god himself since the life of the divine 
child which you have eaten will feel like glowing coals in you 
it will burn inside you like a terrible inextinguishable fire but 
despite all the torment you cannot let it be since it will not let 
you be from this you will understand that your god is alive and 
that your soul has begun wandering on remorseless paths you 
feel that the fire of the sun has erupted in you something new 
has been added to you a holy affliction 
sometimes you no longer recognize yourself you want to 
overcome it but it overcomes you you want to set limits 
but it compels you to keep going you want to elude it but it 
comes with you you want to employ it but you are its tool you 
want to think about it but your thoughts obey it finally the 
fear of the inescapable seizes you for it comes after you slowly 
and invincibly 
there is no escape so it is that you come to know what a real 
god is now youll thinlc up clever truisms preventive measures 
secret escape routes excuses potions capable of inducing 
forgetfulness but its all useless the fire burns right through 
you that which guides forces you onto the way 
but the way is my own self my own life founded upon myself 
the god wants my life he wants to go with me sit at the table 
with me work with me above all he wants to be everpresent 
but im ashamed of my god i dont want to be divine but 
reasonable the divine appears to me as irrational craziness i hate 
it as an absurd disturbance of my meaningful human activity it 
seems an unbecoming sickness which has stolen into the regular 
course of my life yes i even find the divine superfluous  image 
 image  image  image  image  image  
image  image  image  image  image  
image  image  image  image  image  
image  image  image   
iso instead of this sentence the drqft has this experience accomplished what i needed it occurred in the most abominable manner the evil that i wanted performed 
the infamous deed seemingly without me and yet with me since i learned that i am party to all the horror of human nature i destroyed the divine child the image 
of my gods formation through the most dreadful crime which human nature is capable of it takes this atrocity to destroy the image of the god that drinks all my life 
force so that i could reclaim my life p

iss in black book  in jungs fantasy of october   a figure appears ha who says he is the father of philemon jungs soul describes him as a black magician his secret 
is the runes which jungs soul wants to learn he refuses to teach them but shows some examples which jungs soul asks him to explain some of the runes later 
appear in these paintings about the runes in this painting ha explained see the two with different feet one earth foot and one sun footwhich reach toward the 
upper cone and have the sun inside but i have made one crooked line toward the other sun therefore one must reach downward meanwhile the upper sun comes 
out of the cone and the cone gazes after it dejected about where it is going one has to retrieve it with a hook and would like to place it in the small prison then 
the three have to stand together unite and twirl up at the top curled with this they manage to free the sun from its prison again now you make a thick bottom 
and a  where the sun sits safe at the top but inside the house the other sun has risen also therefore you too are coiled up at the top and have made a roof over 
the prison again at the bottom so that the upper sun cannot enter the two suns always want to be together i said so didnt i the two coneseach has a sun you 
want to let them come together because then you think that thus you could be one you have now drawn up both suns and brought them to one another and now 
slope to the other sidethat is important  but then there are simply two suns at the bottom so therefore you have to go to the lower cone then you put the suns 
together there but in the middle neither at the bottom nor at the top therefore there are not four but two but the upper cone is at the bottom and there is a thick 
roof above and if you want to continue you long to return with both arms but at the bottom you have a prison for two for both of you therefore you make a prison 
for the lower sun and fall toward the other side to get the lower sun out of the prison this is what you long for and the upper cone comes and makes a bridge toward 
the lower taking back its sun which has run away before and now the morning clouds come into the lower cone but its sun is beyond the line invisible horizon 
now you are one and happy that you have the sun at the top and long to be up there too but you are imprisoned in the prison of the lower sun that is rising there 
is a stop now you make something quadrilateral above which you call thoughts a prison without doors with thick walls so that the upper sun does not leave but the 
cone has already gone you lean toward the other side long for the below and coil up at the bottom then you are ole and make the serpents way between the suns
that is amusing roj and important  but because it was amusing below there is a roof above and you must raise upward the hook with both arms so that it goes 
through the roof then the sun below is free and there is a prison above you look downward but the upper sun looks toward you but you stand upright as a pair and

divine folly 
cap xiv 
hi   am standing in a high hall before me i see a green 
curtain between two columns the curtain parts easily i see into 
a small deep room with bare walls there is a small window with 
bluish glass above i set foot on the stair leading up to this room 
between the pillars and enter in the rear wall i see a door right 
and left its as if i must choose between right and left 
i choose the right the door is open i enter im in the reading 
room of a large library in the background sits a small thin man 
of pale complexion apparently the librarian the atmosphere 
is troublingscholarly ambitionsscholarly conceitwounded 
scholarly vanity apart from the librarian i see no one i step 
toward him he looks up from his book and says what do 
you want 
im somewhat embarrassed since i dont know what i really 
want thomas a kempis crosses my mind 
i id like to have thomas a kempiss the imitation ojchristo 
he looks at me somewhat astonished as ifhe didnt credit me 
with such an interest he gives me an orderform tofill out i too 
think that its astonishing to ask for thomas a kempis 
are you surprised that im requesting thomass work 
well yes the book is seldom asked for and i wouldnt have 
expected this interest from you 
i must confess that im also somewhat surprised by this 
inspiration but recently i came across a passage from thomas 
that made a particular impression on me why i cant really say if i remember correctly it dealt with the problem of the imitation 
of christ 
do you have particular theological or philosophical 
interests or 
do you meanwhether i want to read it for the purpose 
of prayer 
well hardly 
if i read thomas a kempis i do so for the sake of prayer or 
something similar rather than out of scholarly interest 
are you that religious i had no idea 
you know that i value science extraordinarily highly but 
there are actually moments in life where science also leaves us 
empty and sick in such moments a book like thomass means 
very much to me since it is written from the soul 
but somewhat oldfashioned we can no longer get involved 
in christian dogmatics these days surely 
we havent come to an end with christianity by simply putting 
it aside it seems to me that theres more to it than we see 
what is there about it its just a religion  
for what reasons and moreover at what age do men set it 
aside presumably most do so during their student days or perhaps 
even earlier would you call that a particularly discriminating 
age and have you ever examined more closely the grounds 
on which people put aside positive religion the grounds are 
mostly dubious such as that the contents of belief clash with 
natural science or philosophy 
in my view such an objection should not necessarily be 
rejected out of hand despite the fact that there are better reasons 
for example i consider the lack of a true and proper sense of 
have detached the serpent from youyou have probably been put off therefore you malce a prison for the below now the serpent crosses the sky above the earth you 
are driven completely apart the serpent wriggles its way through the sky around all the stars far above the earth  at the bottom it says the mother gives me this wisdom  
be you content pp  to aniela jaffe jung recounted that he had had a vision of a red clay tablet inscribed with hieroglyphics and embedded in his bedroom 
wall and that he had transcribed the tablet the following day he felt that it contained an important message but he didnt understand it mp p i in letters to sabina 
spielrein dated september i and october  ii jung commented on the significance of some hieroglyphs shed seen in a dream on october  he wrote to her 
that with your hieroglyphics we are dealing with phylogenetic engrams of a historical symbolic nature commenting on the contempt meted out to traniformations 
and symbols of the libido by the freudians he described himself as clinging to his runes which he would not hand over to those who would not understand them the 
letters of jung to sabina spielrein journal of analytical psychology i i p i 
i the runes in this painting appear in black book  in the entry fr october  iijung appended the date  september ii to them ha explained if you have 
managed to move the arc forward you make a bridge below and move upward and downward from the center or you separate above and below split the sun again and 
crawl like the serpent over the upper and receive the lower you take with you what you have experienced and go forward to something new p ii 
i the runes in this painting appear in black book  in the entry for october  iijung appended the date ii september ii to them ha explained now however 
you make a bridge between you and the one longs for the below but the serpent crawls at the top and draws the sun up then both of you move upward and want to 
go to the upper  but the sun is below and tries to draw you down but you draw a line above the below and long for the above and are completely at one there the 
serpent comes and wants to drink from the vessel of the below but there comes the upper cone and stops like the serpent the looking coils back and moves forward 
again and afterward you very much  long to return but the lower sun pulls and thus you become balanced again but soon you fall backward since the one has 
reached out toward the upper sun the other does not want this and so you fall asunder and therefore you must bind yourselves together three times then you stand 
upright again and you hold both suns before you as if they were your eyes the light of the above and the below before you and you stretch your arms out toward it 
and you come together to become one and must separate the two suns and you long to return a little to the lower and reach out toward the upper but the lower cone 
has swallowed the upper cone into itsel because the suns were so close therefore you place the upper cone back up again and because the lower is then no longer 
there you want to draw it up again and have a profound longing for the lower cone while it is empty above since the sun above the line is invisible because you have 
longed to return downward for so long the upper cone comes down and tries to capture the invisible lower sun within itself there the serpents way goes at the very 
top you are split and everything below is beneath the ground you long to be further above but the lower longing already comes crawling like a serpent and you build a 
prison over her but there the lower comes up you longto be at the very bottom and the two suns suddenly reappear close together you long for this and come to be 
imprisoned then the one is defiant and the other longs for the below the prison opens the one longs even more to be below but the defiant one longs for the above 
and is no longer defiant but longs for what is to come and thus it comes to pass the sun rises at the bottom but it is imprisoned and above three nest boxes are made 
for you two and the upper sun which you expect because you have imprisoned the lower one but now the upper cone comes down powerfully and divides you and 
swallows the lower cone this is impossible therefore you place the cones tip to tip and curl up toward the front in the center because thats no way to leave matters 
so it has to happen otherwise the one attempts to reach upward the other downward you must strive to do this since if the tips of the cones meet they can hardly 
be separated anymoretherefore i have placed the hard seed inbetween tip to tipthat would be too beautifully regular this pleases father and mother but where 
does that leave me and my seed therefore a quick change of plan one makes a bridge between you both imprisons the lower sun again the one longs for the above 
and the below but the other longs especially strongly for the forward above and below thus the future can becomesee how weill can already say ityes indeed 
i am clevercleverer than yousince you have taken matters in hand so well you also get everything beneath the roof and into the house the serpent and the two 
suns that is always most amusing but you are separated and because you have drawn the line above the serpent and the suns are too far below this happens because 
beforehand you curled around yourself from below but you come together and into agreement and stand upright because it is good and amusing and fine and you say thus 
shall it remain but down comes the upper cone because it felt dissatisfied that you had set a limit above beforehand the upper cone reaches out immediately for its 
sunbut there is nowhere a sun to be found anymore and the serpent also jumps up to catch the suns you fall over and one of you is eaten by the lower cone with 
the help of the upper cone you get him out and in return you give the lower cone its sun and the upper cone its as well you spread yourself out like the oneeyed who 
wanders in heaven and hold the cones beneath youbut in the end matters still go awry you leave the cones and the suns to go and stand side by side and still do not 
want the same in the end you agree to bind yourself threefold to the upper cone descending from above  i am called hahahaa jolly namei am cleverlook 
here my last sign that is the magic of the white man who lived in the great magic house the magic which you call christianity your medicine man said so himself i and 
the father are one no one comes to the father other than through me i told you so the upper cone is the father he has bound himself threefold to you and stands 
between the other and the father therefore the other must go through him ifhe wants to reach the cone pp ii

i the imitation ofchrist is a work of devotional instruction that appeared at the beginning of the fifteenth century and became extremely popular its authorship is still 
in dispute though it is generally attributed to thomas a kempis ca ioii who was a member of the brethren of the common life a religious community in 
the netherlands that was a prime representative of the devotio moderna a movement stressing mediation and the inner life in clear and simple language the imitation of 
christ exhorts people to be concerned with the inner spiritual life as opposed to outer things gives advice as to how this is to be lived and shows the comfort and ulti
mate rewards of a life lived in christ the title derives from the first line of the first chapter where it is also stated that anyone who wishes to understand and to savor 
the words of christ to the full must try to make his whole life conform to the pattern of christs life the imitation of christ tr b knott london fount i book i

actuality in religion a disadvantage incidentally a host of substitutes 
now exists for the loss of opportunity for prayer caused by the 
collapse of religion nietzsche for example has written a more 
than veritable book of prayerr not to mention faust 
i suppose thats correct in a certain sense but especially 
nietzsches truth strikes me as too agitated and provocative its 
good for those who are yet to be set free for that reason his truth 
is good only for them i believe that ive recently discovered that 
we also need a truth for those who are forced into a corner its 
possible that instead they need a depressive truth which makes man 
smaller and more inward 
forgive me but nietzsche interiorizes man exceptionally well 
perhaps from your standpoint youre right but i cant help 
feeling that nietzsche speaks to those who need more freedom 
not to those who clash strongly with life who bleed from wounds 
and who hold fast to actualities 
but nietzsche confers a precious feeling of superiority upon 
such people 
i cant dispute that but i know men who need inferiority not 
superiority 
you express yourself very paradoxically i dont understand 
you inferiority can hardly be a desideratum 
perhaps youll understand me better if instead of inferiority 
i say resignation a word that one used to hear a lot o but 
seldom anymore 
it also sounds very christian 
as i said there seem to be all sorts of things in christianity 
that maybe one would do well to keep nietzsche is too 
oppositional like everything healthy and longlasting truth 
unfortunately adheres more to the middle way which we 
unjustly abhor 
i really had no idea that you talce such a mediating position 
neither did i my position is not entirely clear to me if i 
mediate i certainly mediate in a very peculiar manner 
at this moment the servant brought the book and i took my 
leave from the librarian 
 the divine wants to live with me my resistance is in vain 
i asked my thinking and it said take as your model one that 
shows you how to live the divine our natural model is christ 
we have stood under his law since antiquity first outwardly and 
then inwardly at first we knew this and then knew it no longer 
we fought against christ we deposed him and we seemed to be 
conquerors but he remained in us and mastered us 
it is better to be thrown into visible chains than into invisible 
ones you can certainly leave christianity but it does not leave 
you your liberation from it is delusion christ is the way you 
can certainly run away but then you are no longer on the way 
the way of christ ends on the cross hence we are crucified nox secunda i  
with him in ourselves with him we wait until we die for our 
resurrection  with christ the living experience no resurrection 
unless it occurs after death 
if i imitate christ he is always ahead of me and i can never 
reach the goal unless i reach it in him  but thus i move beyond 
myself and beyond time in and through which i am as i am i 
thus blunder into christ and his time which created him thus 
and not otherwise and so i am outside my time despite the 
fact that my life is in this time and i am split between the life of 
christ and my life that still belongs to this present time but if i 
am truly to undersand christ i must realize how christ actually 
lived only his own life and imitated no one he did not emulate 
any mode 
if i thus truly imitate christ i do not imitate anyone i emulate 
no one but go my own way and i will also no longer call myself 
a christian initially i wanted to emulate and imitate christ by 
living my life while observing his precepts a voice in me protested 
against this and wanted to remind me that my time also had its 
prophets who struggle against the yoke with which the past 
burdens us i did not succeed in uniting christ with the prophets of 
this time the one demands bearing the other discarding the one 
commands submission the other the will how should i think 
of this contradiction without doing injustice to either what i 
could not conjoin in my mind probably lends itself to living one 
after the other 
and so i decided to cross over into lower and everyday life my 
life and to begin down there where i stood 
when thinking leads to the unthinkable it is time to return 
to simple life what thinking cannot solve life solves and what 
action never decides is reserved for thinking if i ascend to the 
highest and most difficult on the one hand and seek to eke out 
redemption that reaches even higher then the true way does not 
lead upward but toward the depths since only my other leads me 
beyond myself but acceptance of the other means a descent into 
the opposite from seriousness into the laughable from suffering 
into the cheerful from the beautiful into the ugly from the pure 
into the impurei

hi roo on leaving the library i stood in the anteroom 
againb this time i look across to the door on the left i put the 
small book into my pocket and go to the door it is also open and 
leads to a large kitchen with a large chimney over the stove two 
long tables stand in the middle of the room flanked by benches 
brass pots copper pans and other vessels stand on shelves along 
the walls a large fat woman is standing at the stoveapparently 
ch i p  the theme of the imitation of christ dates back much earlier there was much discussion in the middle ages concerning how this was to be understood 
on the history of this notion see giles constable the ideal of the imitation of christ in three studies in medieval religious and social thought cambridge cambridge 
university press  pp  as constable shows two broad approaches may be distinguished depending upon how imitation was understood the first the 
imitation of the divinity of christ stressed the doctrine of deification by which christ showed the way to become god through him p  the 
second the imitation of the humanity and body of christ stressed the imitation of his life on earth the most extreme form of this was in the tradition of stigmatics 
individuals who bore the wounds of christ on their body 
 ie thus spoke zarathustra 
 in the imitation ojchrist thomas a kempis wrote there is no salvation for the soul nor hope for eternal life except in the cross take up your cross then and follow 
jesus and you will enter eternal life he went before you carrying his cross and on the cross he died for you so that you too should carry your cross and long for a 
death on the cross for if you share his death you will also share his life book  ch  p  
 the draft continues but we know that the ancients spoke to us in images hence my thinking advised me to emulate christ not to imitate him but because he is the 
way if i follow a way i do not imitate him but if i imitate christ he is my goal and not my way but if he is my way i thus go toward his goal as the mysteries had 
shown me previously thus my thinking spoke to me in a confused and ambiguous manner but it advised me to imitate christ p  
 the drqft continues his own way led him to the cross for humanitys own way leads to the cross my way also leads to the cross but not to that of christ but to 
mine which is the image of the sacrifice and of life but as i was still blinded i was inclined to yield to the enormous temptation of imitation and to look across to 
christ as ifhe were my goal and not my way p 
 the references seem to be to schopenhauer and nietzsche respectively 
 the drqft continues consider this once you have considered it you will understand the adventure that beset me the following night p

  i liber secundus  
the cookwearing a checkered apron i greet her somewhat 
astonished she too seems embarrassed i ask her may i sit down 
for a while its cold outside and i must wait for something 
please have a seat 
she wipes the table in front of me having nothing else to do 
i take out my thomas and begin to read the cook is curious and 
looks at me furtively every once in a while she goes past me 
excuse me are you perhaps a clergyman 
no why do you think so 
oh i just thought you mightbe because you are reading a 
small black book my mother may god rest her soul left me such 
a book 
i see and what book might that be 
it is called the imitation of christ its a very beautiful book 
i often pray with it in the evenings 
you have guessed well i too am reading the imitation ofchrist 
 dont believe that a man like you would read such a book 
unless he were a pastor 
why shouldnt i read it it also does me good to read a 
proper book 
viy mother god bless her had it with her on her deathbed 
and she gave it to me before she died 
i browse through the book absentmindedly while she is 
spealcing my eyes fall on the following  passage in the nineteenth 
chapter the righteous base their intentions more on the mercy 
of god which in whatever they undertake they trust more than 
their own wisdom 
this is the intuitive method that thomas recommends it 
occurs to me i turn to the cook your mother was a clever 
woman and she did well to give you this book 
yes indeed it has often comforted me in difficult hours and 
it always provides good counse 
i become immersed in my thoughts again i believe one can 
also follow ones own nose that would also bel the intuitive 
method but the beautiful way in which christ does this must 
nevertheless be of special value i would like to imitate christan 
inner disquiet seizes mewhat is supposed to happen i hear 
an odd swishing and whirringand suddenly a roaring sound 
fills the room like a horde of large birdswith a frenzied 
flapping of wingsi see many shadowlike human forms rush 
past and i hear a manifold babble of voices utter the words 
let us pray in the temple 
where are you rushing off to i call out a bearded 
man with tousled hair and dark shining eyes stops and turns toward me we are wandering to jerusalem to pray at the most 
holy sepulcher 
take me with you 
you cannot join us you have a body but we are dead 
who are you 
i am ezechiel and i am an anabaptist 
who are those wandering with you 
these are my fellow believers 
why are you wandering 
we cannot stop but must make a pilgrimage to all the 
holy places 
what drives you to this 
i dont know but it seems that we still have no peace although 
we died in true belief 
why do you have no peace if you died in true belief 
it always seems to me as if we had not come to aproper end 
with life 
remarkablehow so 
i t seems to me that we forgot something important that 
should also have been lived 
and what was that 
would you happen to know 
with these words he reaches out greedily and uncannily 
toward me his eyes shining as if from inner heat 
let go daimon you did not live your animal 
the cook is standing in front of me with a horrified face she 
has talcen me by the arm and grips me firmly for gods sake she 
calls out help whats wrong with you are you in a bad way 
i look at her astonished and wonder where i really am but 
soon strange people burst inamong them the librarian
infinitely astonished and dismayed at first then laughing 
maliciously oh i might have known iclc the police 
before i can collect myself i am pushed through a crowd  
of people into a van i am still clutching my copy of thomas and 
ask myself what would he say to this new situation i open 
the booldet and my eyes fall on the thirteenth chapter where it 
says so long as we live here on earth we cannot escape temp
tation there is no man who is so perfect and no saint so sacred 
that he cannot be tempted on occasion yes we can hardly be 
without temptation 
wise thomas you always come up with the right answer that 
crazy anabaptist certainly had no such knowledge or he might 
have made a peaceful end he also could have read it in cicero 
rerum omnium satietas vitae focit satietatemsatietas vitae tempus maturum 
 the resolve of the upright depends upon the grace of god not on their own wisdom in him they trust whatever they undertake for man proposes god disposes 
and it is lotfor man to choose his lot the imitation of christ book  ch  p  
 instead of this sentence black book  has well henri bergson i think there you have itthis is precisely the genuine and right intuitive method p  on march 
  adolf keller gave a talk on bergson and the theory oflibido to the zurich psychoanalytical society in the discussion jung said bergson should have been 
discussed here long ago b says everything that we have not said mzs vol  p  on july  jung gave a talk in london where he noted that his constructive 
method corresponded to bergsons intuitive method on psychological understanding collected papers on analytical psychology ed constance long london 
balliere tindall and cox  p  the work jung read was l evolution creatrice paris alcan  he possessed the  german translation 
 cary bayness transcription has bergsons 
 in the draft the speaker is identified as the uncanny one 
 the biblical ezechiel was a prophet in the sixth century bce jung saw a great deal of historical significance in his visions which incorporated a mandala with quaternities 
as representing the humanization and differentiation of yahweh although ezechiels visions are often viewed as pathological jung defended their normality arguing that 
visions are natural phenomena that can be designated as pathological only when their morbid aspects have been demonstrated answer to job  cw ii  
 anabaptism was a radical movement of the sixteenthcentury protestant reformation which tried to restore the spirit of the early church the movement 
originated in zurich in the s where they rebelled against zwingli and luthers reluctance to completely reform the church they rejected the practice of infant 
baptism and promoted adult baptisms the first of these took place in zollikon which is near kusnacht where jung lived anabaptists stressed the immediacy of the 
human relation with god and were critical of religious institutions the movement was violently suppressed and thousands were killed see daniel liechty ed early 
anabaptist spirituality selected writings new york paulist press  
 in  jungargued that christianity had suppressed the animal element on the unconscious cw   he elaborated this theme in his  seminars in 
polzeath cornwall in  he argued that the psychological sin which christ committed was that he did not live the animal side of himself modern psychology  p  
 chapter  of book  of the imitation ojchrist begins as long as we are in this world we shall have to face trials and temptations as it says in the book of jobwhat 
is mans life on earth but a time of temptation that is why we should treat our temptations as a serious matter and endeavor by vigilance and prayer to keep the devil 
from finding any loophole remember that the devil never sleeps but goes about looking for his prey there is no one so perfect and holy that he never meets temptation 
we cannot escape it altogether p  he goes on to emphasize the benefits of temptation as being the means through which a man is humbled purified and disciplined

 mortis affert satiety of all things causes satiety of lifeone is 
satiated with life and the time is ripe for deathj this knowledge 
had evidently brought me into conflict with society i was flanked 
by policemen left and right well i said to them you can let 
me go now yes we know all about this  one said laughing 
now just you hold your peace said the other sternly so we are 
obviously heading for the madhouse that is a high price to pay 
but one can go this way too it seems its not so strange since 
thousands of our fellows take that path 
we have arriveda large gate a halla friendly bustling 
superintendentand now also two doctors one of them is a 
small fat professor 
pr whats that book youve got there 
its thomas a kempis the imitation of christ  
pr so a form of religious madness perfectly clear religious 
paranoiaiyou see my dear nowadays the imitation of christ 
leads to the madhouse 
that is hardly to be doubted professor 
pr the man has withe is obviously somewhat maniacally 
aroused do you hear voices 
you bet today it was a huge throng of anabaptists that 
swarmed through the kitchen 
pr now there we have it are the voices following you 
oh no heaven forbid i summoned them 
pr ah this is yet another case that clearly indicates that 
hallucinations directly call up voices this belongs in the case 
history would you immediately malce a note of that doctor 
with all due respect professor may i say that it is absolutely 
not abnormal but much rather the intuitive method 
pr excellent the fellow also uses neologisms welli 
suppose we have an adequately clear diagnosis anyway i wish 
you a good recovery and make sure you stay quiet 
but professor im not at all sick i feel perfectly well 
pr look my dear you dont have any insight into your 
illness yet the prognosis is naturally pretty bad with at best 
limited recovery 
superintendent professor can the man keep the book 
pr well i suppose so as it seems to be a harmless 
prayer book 
now my clothes are inventoriedthen the bathand now 
im talcen off to the ward i enter a large sickroom where im 
told to get into bed the person to my left is lying motionless 
with a transfixed gaze while the one to the right appears to 
possess a brain whose girth and weight are shrinking i enjoy 
perfect silence the problem of madness is profound divine 
 madnessa higher form of the irrationality of the life streaming 
through usat any rate a madness that cannot be integrated into 
presentday societybut how what if the form of society were 
integrated into madness at this point things grow dark and 
there is no end in sight nox secunda i  
 hi  the growing plant sprouts a sapling on its 
righthand side and when this is completely formed the natural 
urge to grow will not develop beyond the final bud but flows back 
into the stem into the mother of the sprig paving an uncertain 
way in the dark and through the stem and finally finding the 
right position on the left where it sprouts a new sapling but this 
new direction of growth is completely opposed to the previous 
one and yet the plant nevertheless grows regularly in this way 
without overstraining or disturbing its balance 
on the right is my thinking on the left is my feeling i enter 
the space of my feeling which was previously unknown to me 
and see with astonishment the difference between my two rooms 
i cannot help laughingmany laugh instead of crying i have 
stepped from the right foot onto the left and wince struck by 
inner pain the difference between hot and cold is too great i 
leave the spirit of this world which has thought christ through 
to the end and step over into that other funnyfrightful realm in 
which i can find christ again 
the imitation of christ led me to the master himself and to 
his astonishing kingdom i do not know what i want there i can 
only follow the master who governs this other realm in me in 
this realm other laws are valid than the guidelines of my wisdom 
here the mercy of god which i had never relied on for good 
practical reasons is the highest law of action the mercy of 
god signifies a particular  state of the soul in which i entrust 
myself to all neighbors with trembling and hesitation and with 
the mightiest outlay of hope that everything will work out well 
i can no longer say that this or that goal should be reached or 
that this or that reason should apply because it is good instead i 
grope through mist and night no line emerges no law appears 
instead everything is thoroughly and convincingly accidental as 
a matter of fact even terribly accidental but one thing becomes 
dreadfully clear namely that contrary to my earlier way and all its 
insights and intentions henceforth all is error it becomes ever 
more apparent that nothing leads as my hope sought to persuade 
me but that everything misleads 
and suddenly to your shivering horror it becomes clear to you 
that you have fallen into the boundless the abyss the inanity of 
eternal chaos it rushes toward you as if carried by the roaring 
wings of a storm the hurtling waves of the sea 
every man has a quiet place in his soul where everything 
is selfevident and easily explainable a place to which he likes 
to retire from the confusing possibilities of life because there 
everything is simple and clear with a manifest and limited 
purpose about nothing else in the world can a man say with 
the same conviction as he does of this place you are nothing 
but   and indeed he has said it  
and even this place is a smooth surface an everyday wall 
nothing more than a snugly sheltered and frequently polished 
crust over the mystery of chaos if you break through this most 
everyday of walls the overwhelming stream of chaos will flood

rr  i liber secundus rr 
in chaos is not single but an unending multiplicity it is not 
formless otherwise it would be single but it is filled with 
figures that have a confusing and overwhelming effect due to 
their fullness  
these figures are the dead not just your dead that is all the 
images of the shapes you took in the past which your ongoing life 
has left behind but also the thronging dead of human history 
the ghostly procession of the past which is an ocean compared 
to the drops of your own life span i see behind you behind the 
mirror of your eyes the crush of dangerous shadows the dead 
who look greedily through the empty sockets of your eyes who 
moan and hope to gather up through you all the loose ends of 
the ages which sigh in them your cluelessness does not prove 
anything put your ear to that wall and you will hear the rustling 
of their procession 
now you know why you lodged the simplest and most easily 
explained matters in just that spot why you praised that peaceful 
seat as the most secure so that no one least of all yoursel 
would unearth the mystery there for this is the place where 
day and night agonizingly merge what you excluded from your 
life what you renounced and damned everything that was and 
could have gone wrong awaits you behind that wall before which 
you sit quietly 
if you read the books of history you will find men who sought 
the strange and incredible who ensnared themselves and who 
were held captive by others in wolvs lairs men who sought the 
highest and the lowest and who were wiped by fate incomplete 
from the tablets of the living few of the living know of them and 
these few appreciate nothing about them but shake their heads at 
such delusion 
while you mock them one of them stands behind you panting 
from rage and despair at the fact that your stupor does not attend 
to him he besieges you in sleepless nights sometimes he takes 
hold of you in an illness sometimes he crosses your intentions 
he malces you overbearing and greedy he pricks your longing for 
everything which avails you nothing he devours your success in 
discord he accompanies you as your evil spirit to whom you can 
grant no release 
have you heard of those dark ones who roamed incognito 
alongside those who ruled the day conspiratorially causing 
unrest who devised cunning things and did not shrink from any 
crime to honor their god 
beside them place christ who was the greatest among them 
it was too little for him to brealc the world so he broke himself 
and therefore he was the greatest of them all and the powers 
of this world did not reach him but i spealc of the dead who 
fell prey to power broken by force and not by themselves their 
hordes people the land of the soul if you accept  them they fill 
you with delusion and rebellion against what rules the world from 
the deepest and from the highest they devised the most danger
ous things they were not of a common nature but fine blades of 
the hardest steel they would have nothing to do with the small 
lives of men they lived on the heights and accomplished the 
lowest they forgot only one thing they did not live their animal 
the animal does not rebel against its own kind consider 
animals how just they are how wellbehaved how they keep 
to the timehonored how loyal they are to the land that bears 
them how they hold to their accustomed routes how they care for their young how they go together to pasture and how they 
draw one another to the spring there is not one that conceals 
its overabundance of prey and lets its brother starve as a result 
there is not one that tries to enforce its will on those of its own 
kind not a one mistakenly imagines that it is an elephant when 
it is a mosquito the animal lives fittingly and true to the life of its 
species neither exceeding nor falling short of it 
he who never lives his animal must treat his brother like an 
animal abase yourself and live your animal so that you will be 
able to treat your brother correctly you will thus redeem all those 
roaming dead who strive to feed on the living and do not turn 
anything you do into a law since that is the hubris of power iso 
when the time has come and you open the door to the dead 
your horrors will also afflict your brother for your countenance 
proclaims the disaster hence withdraw and enter solitude since 
no one can give you counsel if you wrestle with the dead do not 
cry for help if the dead surround you otherwise the living will 
talce flight and they are your only bridge to the day live the life 
of the day and do not speak of mysteries but dedicate the night 
to bringing about the salvation of the dead 
for whoever wellmeaningly tears you away from the dead has 
rendered you the worst service since he has torn your life branch 
from the tree of divinity he also sins against restoring what 
was created and later subjugated and lost lsi for the earnest 
expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the 
sons of god for the creature was made subject to vanity not 
willingly but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in 
hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from 
the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children 
of god for we know that the whole creation groaneth and 
travaileth in pain together until now 
every step upward will restore a step downward so that the 
dead will be delivered into freedom the creating of the new 
shrinks from the day since its essence is secret it prepares the 
destruction of precisely this day in the hope of leading it over 
into a new creation something evil is attached to the creation 
of the new which you cannot proclaim loudly the animal that 
looks for new hunting grounds cowers slinking and sniffing on 
dark paths and does not want to be surprised 
please consider that it is the suffering of the creative that they 
carry something evil in them a leprosy of the soul that separates 
them from its danger they could praise their leprosy as a virtue 
and could indeed do so out of virtuousness but this would be 
doing what christ does and would therefore be his imitation 
for only one was christ and only one could violate the laws as he 
did it is impossible to commit higher infringements on his path 
fulfill that which comes to you break the christ in yourself so 
that you may arrive at yourself and ultimately at your animal 
which is wellbehaved in its herd and unwilling to infringe its 
laws may it suffice in terms of transgression that you do not 
imitate christ since thereby you take a step back from christianity 
and a step beyond it christ brought salvation through adeptness 
and ineptitude will save you 
have you counted the dead whom the master of sacrifice 
honored have you asked them for whose salce they believe 
they have suffered death have you entered the beauty of their 
thoughts and the purity of their intention and they shall go forth 
and look upon the carcasses of the men that have transgressed 
 jungs marginal note to the calligraphic volume    the date appears to refer to when this section was transcribed into the calligraphic volume 
 in  jung said in a seminar we are prejudiced in regard to the animal people dont understand when i tell them they should become acquainted with their animals 
or assimilate their animals they think the animal is always jumping over walls and raising hell allover town yet in nature the animal is a wellbehaved citizen it is 
pious it follows the path with great regularity it does nothing extravagant only man is extravagant so if you assimilate the character of the animal you become a 
peculiarly lawabiding citizen you go very slowly and you become very reasonable in your ways in as much as you can afford it visions i p

 against me for their worm shall not die neither shall their fire 
be quenched 
thus do penance consider what fell victim to death for the 
sake of christianity lay it before you and force yourself to accept 
it for the dead need salvation the number of the unredeemed 
dead has become greater than the number of living christians 
therefore it is time that we accept the dead 
do not throw yourself against what has become enraged or 
benton destruction what will you put in its place do you not 
know that if you are successful in destroying what has become 
you will then turn the will of destruction against yourself but 
anyone who makes destruction their goal will perish through 
selfdestruction much rather respect what has become since 
reverence is a blessing 
then turn to the dead listen to their lament and accept 
them with love be not their blind spokesman  image  
 there are prophets who in the end have stoned themselves but 
we seek salvation and hence we need to revere what has become 
and to accept the dead who have fluttered through the air and 
lived like bats under our roofs since time immemorial the new 
will be built on the old and the meaning of what has become will 
become manifold your poverty in what has become you will thus 
deliver into the wealth of the future 
what seeks to distance you from christianity and its holy rule 
of love are the dead who could find no peace in the lord since 
their uncompleted work has followed them a new salvation is always 
a restoring of the previously lost did not christ himself restore 
bloody human sacrifice which better customs had expelled from 
sacred practice since days of old did he not himself reinstate 
the sacred practice of the eating of human sacrifice in your 
sacred practice that which earlier laws condemned will once again 
be included 
however just as christ brought back human sacrifice and the 
eating of the sacrificed all this happened to him and not to his 
brother since christ placed above it the highest law of love so 
that no brother would come to harm as a result but so that all 
could rejoice in the restoration the same thing happened as in 
ancient times but now under the law of love  so if you have no 
reverence for what has become you will destroy the law oflove 
and what will become of you then you will be forced to restore 
what was before namely violent deeds murder wrongdoing and 
contempt of your brother and one will be alien to the other and 
confusion will rule 
 this is a citation from isaiah  nox secunda i  
therefore you should have reverence for what has become so 
that the law oflove may become redemption through the restoration 
of the lower and of the past not perdition through the boundless 
mastery of the dead but the spirits of those who die before 
their time will live for the sake of our present incompleteness 
in dark hordes in the rafters of our houses and besiege our ears 
with urgent laments until we grant them redemption through 
restoring what has existed since ancient times under the rule 
of love 
what we call temptation is the demand of the dead who 
passed away prematurely and incomplete through the guilt of the 
good and of the law for no good is so complete that it could not 
do injustice and brealc what should not be broken 
we are a blinded race we live only on the surface only in 
the present and think only of tomorrow we deal roughly with 
the past in that we do not accept the dead we want to work 
only with visible success above all we want to be paid we would 
consider it insane to do hidden work that does not visibly serve 
men there is no doubt that the necessity of life forced us to 
prefer only those fruits one can taste but who suffers more from 
the tempting and misleading influence of the dead than those 
who have gone wholly missing on the surface of the world 
there is one necessary but hidden and strange worka 
major workwhich you must do in secret for the sake of the 
dead he who cannot attain his own visible field and vineyard 
is held fast by the dead who demand the work of atonement 
from him and until he has fulfilled ihis he cannot get to 
his outer work since the dead do not let him he shall have 
to search his soul and act in stillness at their behest and complete 
the mystery so that the dead will not let him do not look 
forward so much but back and into yourself so that you will not 
fail to hear the dead 
it belongs to the way of christ that he ascends with few 
of the living but many of the dead his work was the salvation 
of the despised and lost for whose salce he was crucified between 
two criminals 
i suffer my agony between two madmen i enter the truth if i 
descend become accustomed to being alone with the dead it is 
difficult but this is precisely how you will discover the worth of 
your living companions 
what the ancients did for their dead you seem to believe 
that you can absolve yourself from the care of the dead and 
from the work that they so greatly demand since what is dead 
 the drqft continues we were led by a prophet whose proximity to god had driven him insane he raged blindly against christianity in his sermon but he was the 
champion of the dead who had appointed him their spokesman and resounding trumpet he shouted in a deafening voice so that many would hear him and the power 
of his language also burned those who resisted death he preached the struggle against christianity this was good too p  the reference is to nietzsche 
 the draft continues whose champion you are p 
 the drqft continues like that raving prophet who did not know whose cause he was promoting but instead believed himself to be speaking on his own behalf and 
thought he was the will of destruction p  the reference is to nietzsche 
 in  jung anonymously reproduced this image in commentary on the secret of the golden flower as a mandala painted by a male patient during treatment 
he described it as follows in the centre the white light shining in the firmament in the first circle protoplasmic lifeseeds in the second rotating cosmic principles 
which contain the four primary colors in the third and fourth creative forces working inward and outward at the cardinal points the masculine and feminine souls 
both again divided into light and dark cw  a he reproduced it again in  in concerning mandala symbolism and wrote picture by a middleaged man 
in the center is a star the blue sky contains golden clouds at the four cardinal points we see human figures at the top an old man in the attitude of contemplation 
at the bottom loki or hephaestus with red flaming hair holding in his hands a temple to the right and left are a light and dark female figure together they indicate 
four aspects of the personality or four archetypal figures belonging as it were to the periphery of the self the two female figures can be recognized without difficulty 
as the two aspects of the anima the old man corresponds to the archetype of meaning or of the spirit and the dark chthonic figure to the opposite of the wise old 
man namely the magical and sometimes destructive luciferian element in alchemy it is hermes trismegistus versus mercurius the evasive trickster the circle 
enclosing the sky contains structures or organisms that look like protozoa the sixteen globes painted in four colors just outside the circle derived originally from an 
eye motif and therefore stand for the observing and discriminating consciousness similarly the ornaments in the next circle all opening inward are rather like ves
sels pouring out their content toward the center fn there is a similar conception in alchemy in the ripley scrowle and its variants psychology and alchemy fig  
there it is the planetary gods who are pouring their qualities into the bath of rebirth on the other hand the ornaments along the rim open outward as if to receive 
something from outside that is in the individuation process what were originally projections stream back inside and are integrated into the personality again here 
in contrast to figure  above and below male and female are integrated as in the alchemical hermaphrodite cw  i  on march  he wrote to 
raymond piper concerning the same image the other picture is by an educated man about  years old he produced this picture also as an atfirst unconscious 
attempt to restore order in the emotional state he was in which had been caused by an invasion of unconscious contents letters i p  
 the draft continues not one title of christian law is abrogated but instead we are adding a new one accepting the lament of the dead p  
 the drqft continues it is nothing other than common evil desire nothing but everyday temptation as long as you do not know that it is what the dead demand but 
as long as you know about the dead you will understand your temptation as long as it is no more than evil desire what can you do about itr damn it regret it arise

is past you excuse yourself with your disbelief in the immortality 
of the soul do you think that the dead do not exist because 
you have devised the impossibility of immortality you believe 
in your idols of words the dead produce effects that is 
sufficient in the inner world there is no explaining away as 
little as you can explain away the sea in the outer world you 
must finally understand your purpose in explaining away namely 
to seek protection 
i accepted the chaos and in the following night my soul 
approached me i image  i 
n ox tertial 
cap xvi 
hi lob my soul spoke to me in a whisper urgently and 
alarmingly words words do not make too many words be 
silent and listen have you recognized your madness and do you 
admit it have you noticed that all your foundations are completely 
mired in madness do you not want to recognize your madness 
and welcome it in a friendly manner you wanted to accept every
thing so accept madness too let the light of your madness shine 
and it will suddenly dawn on you madness is not to be despised 
and not to be feared but instead you should give it life 
 your words sound hard and the task you set me is difficult 
s if you want to find paths you should also not spurn madness 
since it malees up such a great part of your nature 
 i didnt know that this is so 
s be glad that you can recognize it for you will thus avoid 
becoming its victim madness is a special form of the spirit and 
clings to all teachings and philosophies but even more to daily 
life since life itself is full of craziness and at bottom utterly 
illogical man strives toward reason only so that he can malee 
rules for himself life itself has no rules that is its mystery 
and its unknown law what you call knowledge is an attempt to 
impose something comprehensible on life 
 that all sounds very desolate but nevertheless it prompts 
me to disagree 
s you have nothing to disagree withyou are in the madhouse 
there stands the fat little professorhad he spoken this way 
and had i taken him for my soul 
prof yes my dear you are confused your speech is 
completely incoherent 
i i too believe that ive completely lost myself am i really 
crazy its all terribly confusing 
prof have patience everything will work out anyway 
sleep well 
i thank you but im afraid 
everything inside me is in utter disarray matters are becoming 
serious and chaos is approaching is this the ultimate bottom 
is chaos also a foundation if only there werent these terrible 
waves everything breaks asunder like black billows yes i see and understand it is the ocean the almighty nocturnal tidea 
ship moves therea large steamer im just about to enter the 
smoking parlormany peoplebeautiful clothesthey all look 
at me astonishedsomeone comes up to me and says whats the 
matter you look just like a ghost what happened 
 nothingthat isi believe that i have gone crazythe 
floor swayseverything moves 
someone the sea is somewhat rough this evening thats 
allhave a hot toddyyoure seasick 
i youre right i am seasick but in a special wayim really 
in a madhouse 
someone well now youre joking again life is returning 
 do you call that wit just now the professor pronounced 
me truly and utterly mad 
the fat little professor is actually sitting at a greencovered 
table playing cards he turns toward me when he hears me speale 
and laughs well where did you get to come here would you 
like a drink too youre quite a character i must say youve put 
all the ladies in quite a flurry this evening 
 professor for me this is no longer a joke just now i was 
your patient 
the parlor erupts in unbridled laughter 
prof i hope that i havent upset you too much 
i well to be committed is no small matter 
the person to whom i had been speaking before suddenly 
comes up to me and looks me in the face he is a man with a black 
beard a tousled head of hair and dark shining eyes he speaks to 
me vehemently something worse happened to me its five years 
now that ive been here 
i realize that it is my neighbor who has apparently awakened 
from his apathy and is now sitting on my bed he goes on speaking 
fiercely and urgently but i am nietzsche only rebaptized i am 
also christ the savior and appointed to save the world but they 
wont let me 
i who wont let you 
the fool the devil we are in hell but of course you havent 
noticed it yet i didnt realize until the second year of my time 
here that the director is the devil 
i you mean the professor that sounds incredible 
the fool youre an ignoramus i was supposed to marry the 
mother of god long ago but the professor that devil has her 
in his power every evening when the sun goes down he gets her 
with child in the morning before sunrise she gives birth to it 
then all the devils come together and kill the child in a gruesome 
i image  i manner i distinctly hear his cries 
 but what you have told me is pure mythology 
the fool youre crazy and understand nothing of it you 
belong in the madhouse my god why does my family always 
shut me in with crazy people im supposed to save the world 
im the savior 
he lies down again and sinles back into his lassitude i clutch 
the sides of my bed to protect myself against the terrible waves 
i stare at the wall so that i can at least latch onto something with 
anew only to stumble again and mock and loathe yourself but definitely despise and pity yourself but if you lmow what the dead demand temptation will become the 
wellspring of your best work indeed of the work of salvation when christ ascended after completing his work he led those up with him who had died prematurely 
and incomplete under the law of hardship and alienation and raw violence the lamentations of the dead filled the air at the time and their misery became so loud 
that even the living were saddened and became tired and sick of life and yearned to die to this world already in their living bodies and thus you too lead the dead to 
their completion with your work of salvation pp i 
is the drcift continues you employ old word magic to protect yourself through superstition for you are still a powerless child of the old wood but we can see behind 
your word magic and it is rendered feeble and nothing protects you against the chaos other than acceptance p

my eyes a horizontal line runs along the wall which is painted a 
darker color beneath a radiator stands in front of itit is a railing 
and i can see the sea beyond it the line is the horizon and there 
the sun now rises in red glory solitary and magnificentin it is a 
cross from which a serpent hangsor is it a bull slit open as at 
the slaughterhouse or is it an ass i suppose it is really a ram with 
a crown of thornsor is it the crucified one myself the sun of 
martyrdom has arisen and is pouring bloody rays over the sea 
this spectacle lasts a long time the sun rises higher its rays grow 
brighterl and hotter and the sun burns down white on a blue sea 
the swell has subsided a charitable and quiet summer dawn lies 
on the shimmering sea the salty smell of water rises up a faint 
wide surf brealcs on the sand with a dull thunder and returns 
incessantly twelve times the strokes of the world clockthe 
twelfth hour is complete and now silence enters no noise no 
breeze everything is rigid and deathly still i wait secretlyanx
ious i see a tree arise from the sea its crown reaches to heaven 
and its roots reach down into hell i am completely alone and dis
heartened and gaze from afar it is as if all life had flown from 
me and completely passed into the incomprehensible and fearful 
i am utterly weak and incapable salvation i whisper a strange 
voice spealcs there is no salvation here you must remain calm 
or you will disturb the others it is night and the other people want 
to sleep i see its the attendant the room is dimly lit by a weak 
lamp and sadness weighs on the room 
 i couldnt find the way 
he says you dont need to find a way now 
he speaks the truth the way or whatever it might be on 
which people go is our way the right way there are no paved 
ways into the future we say that it is this way and it is we 
build roads by going on our life is the truth that we seek only 
my life is the truth the truth above all we create the truth by 
living it 
 this is the night in which all the dams broke where what 
was previously solid moved where the stones turned into serpents 
and everything living froze is this a web of words if it is it is a 
hellish web for those caught in it 
there are hellish webs of words only words but what are 
words be tentative with words value them well take safe words 
words without catches do not spin them with one another so that 
no webs arise for you are the first who is ensnared in them for nox tertia i  
words have meanings with words you pull up the underworld 
word the paltriest and the mightiest in words the emptiness 
and the fullness flow together hence the word is an image 
of god the word is the greatest and the smallest that man 
created just as what is created through man is the greatest and 
the smallest 
so if i fall prey to the web of words i fall prey to the greatest 
and the smallest i am at the mercy of the sea of the inchoate 
waves that are forever changing place their essence is movement 
and movement is their order he who strives against waves is 
exposed to the arbitrary the work of men is steady but it swims 
upon chaos the striving of men seems like lunacy to him who 
comes from the sea but men consider him mad he who comes 
from the sea is sick he can hardly bear the gaze of men for to 
him they all seem to be drunk and foolish from sleepinducing 
poisons they want to come to your rescue and as for accepting 
help for sure you would like less of that rather than swindling 
your way into their company and being completely like one who 
has never seen the chaos but only talks about it 
but for him who has seen the chaos thereis no more hiding 
because he knows that the bottom sways and knows what this 
swaying means he has seen the order and the disorder of the 
endless he knows the unlawful laws he knows the sea and can 
never forget it the chaos is terrible days full of lead nights 
full of horror 
but just as christ knew that he was the way the truth and the 
life in that the new torment and the renewed salvation came into 
the world through him i know that chaos must come over men 
and that the hands of those who unknowingly and unsuspectingly 
break through the thin walls that separate us from the sea are 
busy for this is our way our truth and our life 
just as the disciples of christ recognized that god had 
become flesh and lived among them as a man we now recognize 
that the anointed of this time is a god who does not appear in 
the flesh he is no nan and yet is a son of man but in spirit and 
not in flesh hence he can be born only through the spirit of men 
as the conceiving womb of the godoo what is done to this god 
you do to the lowest in yoursel under the law of love according 
to which nothing is cast out for how else should your lowest be 
saved from depravity  image iii  who should accept the 
lowest in you if you do not but he who does it not from love 
 jungs marginal note to the calligraphic volume  this seems to refer to when this passage was transcribed into the calligraphic volume 
 in psychology and religion  jung commented on the symbolism of the world clock cw ii iioff 
 in dantes commedia the following lines are inscribed over the gates of hell abandon every hope you who enter canto  line  see the divine comedy of dante 
aligheri vol i ed and tr robert durling new york oxford university press p  
 the draft continues for words are not merely words but have meanings for which they are set they attract these meanings like daimonic shadows p 
 the drift continues once you have seen the chaos look at your face you saw more than death and the grave you saw beyond and your face bears the mark of one 
who has seen chaos and yet was a man many cross over but they do not see the chaos however the chaos sees them stares at them and imprints its features on them 
and they are marked forever call such a one mad for that is what he is he has become a wave and has lost his human side his constancy p  
 the preceding sentence is crossed out in the corrected drift and jung has written in the margin cpiahmqn identification p 
 jung elaborated on this issue many years later in answer to ob  where he studied the historical transformation of judeochristian god images a major theme 
in this is the continued incarnation of god after christ commenting on the book of revelation jung argued that ever since john the apocalyptist experienced  
for the first time perhaps unconsciously the conflict into which christianity inevitably leads mankind is burdened with this god wanted and wants to become 
man cw ii  in jungs view there was a direct link between johns views and eckharts views this disturbing invasion engendered in him the image of the 
divine consort whose image lives in every man of the child whom meister eckhart also saw in the vision it was he who knew that god alone in his godhead is not 
in a state of bliss but must be born in the human soul the incarnation in christ is the prototype which is continually being transferred to the creature by the holy 
ghost ibid  in contemporary times jung gave great importance to the papal bull of the assumptio maria he held that it points to the hieros gamos in the 
pleroma and this in turn implies as we have said the future birth of the divine child who in accordance with the divine trend toward incarnation will choose as his 
birthplace the empirical man this metaphysical process is known as the individuation process in the psychology of the unconscious ibid  through being identified 
with the continued incarnation of god in the soul the process of individuation found its ultimate significance on may   jung wrote to morton kelsey the 
real history of the world seems to be the progressive incarnation of the deity letters  p  
 image legend the serpent fell dead unto the earth and that was the umbilical cord of a new birth the serpent is similar to the serpent in image  in black book 
 on january  jungs soul refers to images  and iii his soul says the giant cloud of eternal night is awful i see a yellow shining stroke on this cloud from 
the top lefthand corner in the irregular shape of a streak of lightning and behind it an indeterminate reddish light in the cloud it does not move i see a dead black 
serpent lying beneath the cloud and the lightning it does not move beneath the cloud i see a dead black serpent and the thunderbolt stuck in its head like a spear a 
hand as large as that of a god has thrown the spear and everything has frozen to a gloomy image what is it trying to say do you recall that image that you painted 
years ago the one in which the black and red man with the black and white serpent is struck by the ray of god ie image  this image seems to follow that one 
because afterward you also painted the dead serpent ie image iii and did you not behold a gloomy image this morning of that man in the white robe and a black 
face like a mummy i how now what is this supposed to mean soul it is an image of your self p  iioii

 i liber secundus uu 
but from pride selfishness and greed is damned none of the 
damnation is cast out either 
if you accept the lowest in you suffering is unavoidable since 
you do the base thing and build up what lay in ruin there are 
many graves and corpses in us an evil stench of decomposition 
just as christ through the torment of sanctification subjugated 
the flesh so the god of this time through the torment of 
sanctification will subjugate the spirit just as christ tormented 
the flesh through the spirit the god of this time will torment 
the spirit through the flesh for our spirit has become an 
impertinent whore a slave to words created by men and no 
longer the divine word itself 
the lowest in you is the source of mercy we take this sickness 
upon ourselves the inability to find peace the baseness and 
the contemptibility so that the god can be healed and radiantly 
ascend purged of the decomposition of death and the mud of the 
underworld the despicable prisoner will ascend to his salvation 
shining and wholly healed 
is there a suffering that would be too great to want to undergo 
for our god you only see the one and do not notice the other 
but when there is one so there is also another and that is the 
lowest in you but the lowest in you is also the eye of the evil that 
stares at you and looks at you coldly and sucks your light down 
into the dark abyss bless the hand that keeps you up there the 
smallest humanity the lowest living thing geite a few would 
prefer death since christ imposed bloody sacrifice on humanity 
the renewed god will also not spare bloodshed 
wherefore art thou red in thine apparel and thy garments 
like him that treadeth it the winefat i have trodden the winepress 
alone and no one is with me i have trodden myself down in my 
anger and trampled upon myself in my fury hence my blood 
has spattered my clothes and i have stained my robe for i have 
afforded myself a day of vengeance and the year to redeem 
myself has come and i looked around and there was none to 
help and i wondered that there was no one who stood by me therefore my own arm must save me and my fury upheld me 
and i trod myself down in my rage and made myself drunk 
in my fury and spilt my blood on the earth for i took my 
misdeed upon myself so that the god would be healed 
just as christ said that he did not come to male peace but 
brought the sword so he in whom christ becomes complete 
will not give himself peace but a sword he will rebel against 
himself and one will be turned against the other in him he will 
also hate that which he loves in himself he will be castigated in 
himself mocked and given over to the torment of crucifixion 
and no one will aid him or soothe his torment 
just as christ was crucified between the two thieves our 
lowest lies on either side of our way and just as one thief went 
to hell and the other rose up to heaven the lowest in us will be 
sundered in two halves on the day of our judgment the one is 
destined for damnation and death and the other will rise up  
but it will tale a long time until you see what is destined for 
death and what is destined for life since the lowest in you is still 
unseparated and one and in a deep sleep 
if i accept the lowest in me i lower a seed into the ground of 
hell the seed is invisibly small but the tree of my life grows from 
it and conjoins the below with the above at both ends there is 
fire and blazing embers the above is fiery and the below is fiery 
between the unbearable fires grows your life you hang between 
these two poles in an immeasurably frightening movement the 
stretched hanging welters up and down 
we thus fear our lowest since that which one does not possess 
is forever united with the chaos and takes part in its mysterious 
ebb and flow insofar as i accept the lowest in meprecisely that 
red glowing sun of the depthsand thus fall victim to the 
confusion of chaos the upper shining sun also rises therefore 
he who strives for the highest finds the deepest 
to deliver the men of his time from the stretched hanging 
christ effectively took this torment upon himself and taught 
them be crafty like serpents and guileless like doves for 
craftiness counsels against chaos and guilelessness veils its 
 the draft continues but who does this under the law oflove will move beyond suffering sit at the table with the anointed and behold gods glory p 
 the draft continues but god will come to those who take their suffering upon themselves under the law of love and he will establish a new bond with them for it 
is predicted that the anointed is supposed to return but no longer in the flesh but in the spirit and just as christ guided the flesh upward through the torment of 
salvation the anointed of this time will guide the spirit upward through the torment of salvation p 
 the draft continues the lowest in you is the stone that the builders discarded it will become the cornerstone the lowest in you will grow like a grain of rice from 
dry soil shooting up from the sand of the most barren desert and rise and stand very tall salvation comes to you from the discarded your sun will rise from muddy 
swamps like all others you are annoyed at the lowest in you because its guise is uglier than the image of yourself that you love the lowest in you is the most despised 
and least valued full of pain and sickness he is despised so much that one hides ones face from him that he is held in no respect whatsoever and it is even said that 
he does not exist because one is ashamed for his sake and despises oneself in truth it carries our sickness and is ridden with our pain we consider him the one who 
is plagued and punished by god on account of his despicable ugliness but he is wounded and exposed to madness for the sake of our own justice he is crucified and 
suppressed for the sake of our own beauty we leave him to punishment and martyrdom that we might have peace but we will take his sickness upon ourselves and 
salvation will come to us through our own wounds pp  the first lines refer to psalm ii the passage echoes isaiah  which jung cited above p  
 the draft continues why should our spirit not take upon itself torment and restlessness for the salce of sanctification but all this will come over you for i already 
hear the steps of those who bear the keys to open the gates of the depths the valleys and mountains that resound with the noise of battles the lamentation arising 
from innumerable inhabited sites is the omen of what is to come my visions are truth for i have beheld what is to come but you are not supposed to believe me 
because otherwise you will stray from your path the right one that leads you safely to your suffering that i have seen ahead may no faith mislead you accept your 
utmost unbelief it guides you on your way accept your betrayal and infidelity your arrogance and your better knowledge and you will reach the safe and secure route 
that leads you to your lowest and what you do to your lowest you will do to the anointed do not forget this nothing of the law of love is abrogated but much has 
been added to it cursed unto himself is he who kills the one capable of love in himself for the horde of the dead who died for the salce of love is immeasurable and 
the mightiest among these dead is christ the lord holding these dead in reverence is wisdom purgatory awaits those who murder the one in themselves who is 
capable oflove you will lament and rave against the impossibility of uniting the lowest in you with the law of those who love i say to you just as christ subjugated 
the nature of the physical to the spirit under the law of the word of the father the nature of the spirit shall be subjugated to the physical under the law of christs 
completed work of salvation through love you are afraid of the danger but know that where god is nearest the danger is greatest how can you recognize the 
anointed one without any danger will one ever acquire a precious stone with a copper coin the lowest in you is what endangers you fear and doubt guard the gates 
of your way the lowest in you is the unforeseeable for you cannot see it thus shape and behold it you will thus open the floodgates of chaos the sun arises from 
the darkest dampest and coldest the unknowing people of this time only see the one they never see the other approaching them but if the one exists so does the 
other pp  jung here implicitly cites the opening lines of friedrich holderlins patmos which was one of his favorite poems near is  the god and hard 
to grasp  but where danger is  salvation also grows jung discussed this in traniformations and symbols of the libido  cw b if 
 these lines actually cite isaiah  
 matthew  think not that i am come to send peace on earth i came not to send peace but a sword

iiii terrible aspect thus men could take the safe middle path 
hedged both upward and downward 
but the dead of the above and the below mounted and their 
demands grew ever louder and both the noble and the wicked 
rose up again and unaware broke the law of the mediator they 
flung open doors both above and below they drew many after 
them to higher and lower madness thereby sowing confusion 
and preparing the way of what is to come 
but he who goes into the one and not also at the same time 
into the other by accepting what comes toward him will simply 
teach and live the one and turn it into a reality for he will be 
its victim when you go into the one and hence consider the 
other approaching you as your enemy you will fight against 
the other you will do so because you fail to recognize that 
the other is also in you on the contrary you think that the 
other comes somehow from without and you think that you 
also catch sight of it in the views and actions of your fellow 
men which clash with yours you thus fight the other and are 
completely blinded 
but he who accepts what approaches him because it is also in 
him quarrels and wrangles no more but looks into himself and 
keeps silent  image ii  
he sees the tree of life whose roots reach into hell and whose 
top touches heaven he also no longer knows differences 
who is right what is holy what is genuine what is 
good what is correct he knows only one difference the 
difference between below and above for he sees that the tree 
of life grows from below to above and that it has its crown 
at the top clearly differentiated from the roots to him this is 
unquestionable hence he knows the way to salvation 
to unlearn all distinctions save that concerning direction is 
part of your salvation hence you free yourself from the old curse 
of the knowledge of good and evil because you separated good 
from evil according to your best appraisal and aspired only to the 
good and denied the evil that you committed nevertheless and nox tertia i  
failed to accept your roots no longer sudded the dark nourishment 
of the depths and your tree became sick and withered 
therefore the ancients said that after adam had eaten the 
apple the tree of paradise withered your life needs the dark 
but if you know that it is evil you can no longer accept it and you 
suffer anguish and you do not know why nor can you accept it as 
evil else your good will reject you nor can you deny it since you 
know good and evil because of this the knowledge of good and 
evil was an insurmountable curse 
but if you return to primal chaos and if you feel and recognize 
that which hangs stretched between the two unbearable poles of 
fire you will notice that you can no longer separate good and evil 
conclusively neither through feeling nor through knowledge but 
that you can discern the direction of growth only from below to 
above you thus forget the distinction between good and evil and 
you no longer know it as long as your tree grows from below to 
above but as soon as growth stops what was united in growth 
falls apart and once more you recognize good and evil 
you can never deny your knowledge of good and evil to 
yoursel so that you could betray your good in order to live evil 
for as soon as you separate good and evil you recognize them 
they are united only in growth but you grow if you stand still in 
the greatest doubt and therefore steadfastness in great doubt 
is a veritable flower of life 
he who cannot bear doubt does not bear himself such a one 
is doubtful he does not grow and hence he does not live doubt 
is the sign of the strongest and the weakest the strong have 
doubt but doubt has the weak therefore the weakest is close 
to the strongest and if he can say to his doubt i have you 
then he is the strongest but no one can say yes to his doubt 
unless he endures wideopen chaos because there are so many 
among us who can talk about anything pay heed to what they 
live what someone says can be very much or very little thus 
examine his life 
my speech is neither light nor dark since it is the speech of 
someone who is growing

nox quarta 
cap xvii 
hi u i hear the roaring of the morning wind which 
comes over the mountains the night is overcome when all my 
life was subject to eternal confusion and stretched out between 
the poles of fire 
my soul speaks to me in a bright voice the door should be 
lifted off its hinges to provide a free passage between here and 
there between yes and no between above and below between 
left and right airy passages should be built between all opposed 
things light smooth streets should lead from one pole to the other 
scales should be set up whose pointer sways gently a flame should 
burn that cannot be blown out by the wind a stream should flow 
to its deepest goal the herds of wild animals should move to their 
feeding grounds along their old game paths life should proceed 
from birth to death from death to birth unbroken like the path 
of the sun everything should proceed on this path 
thus spealcs my soul but i toy casually and terribly with 
myself is it day or night am i asleep or awake am i alive or 
have i already died 
blind darkness besieges mea great walla gray worm of 
twilight crawls along it it has a round face and laughs the 
laughter is convulsive and actually relieving i open my eyes the 
fat cook is standing before me youre a sound sleeper i must 
say youve slept for more than an hour 
i really have i slept i  must have dreamed what a dreadful 
play did i fall asleep in this kitchen is this really the realm 
of mothers 
have a glass of water youre still thoroughly drowsy 
i yes this sleep can make one drunk where is my thomas 
there it lies open at the twentyfirst chapter my soul in 
everything and yet beyond everything you must find your rest in 
the lord for he is the eternal rest of the saints 
i read this sentence aloud is not every word followed by a 
question mark 
if you fell asleep with this sentence you must really have had 
a beautiful dream 
i i certainly dreamed and i will think about the dream 
incidentally can you tell me whose cook you are 
the librarians he loves good cooking and i have been with 
him for many years  image u  i oh i had no idea that the librarian had such a cook 
yes you must know that hes a gourmet 
i farewell madam cook and thank you for the accommodation 
you are most welcome and the pleasure was entirely mine 
now i am outside so that was the librarians cook does he 
really know what food is prepared inside he has certainly never 
gone in there for a temple sleepo i think that ill return the 
thomas a kempis to him i enter the library 
l good evening here you are again 
i good evening sir ive come to return the thomas i sat 
down for a bit in your kitchen next door to read without suspecting 
that its your kitchen 
l please theres no problem whatsoever hopefully my cook 
received you well 
i i cant complain about the reception i even had an afternoon 
sleep over thomas 
l that doesnt surprise me these prayer books are 
terribly boring 
i yes for people like us but your cook finds the little book 
very edifying  
l well yes for the cook 
i allow me the indiscrete question have you ever had an 
incubation sleep in your kitchen 
 no ive never entertained such a strange idea 
i let me say that youd learn a lot that way about the nature 
of your kitchen good night sir 
after this conversation i left the library and went outside into 
the anteroom where i approached the green curtains i pushed 
them aside and what did i see i saw a highceilinged hall before 
mewith a supposedly magnificent garden in the background
klingsors magical garden it occurred to me at once i had 
entered a theater those two over there are part of the play 
amfortas and kundry or rather just what am i looking at it is 
the librarian and his cook he is ailing and pale and has a bad 
stomach she is disappointed and furious klingsor is standing to 
the left holding the feather the librarian used to tuck behind his 
ear how closely klingsor resembles me what a repulsive play 
but look parsifal enters from the left how strange he also looks 
like me klingsor venomously throws the feather at parsifal but 
the latter catches it calmly 
the scene changes it appears that the audience in this case 
me joins in during the last act one must kneel down as the 
good friday service begins parsifal entersslowly his head 
the spirit of the west the other  forever denied it exists forever recurring in all forms forever the same this one precious vessel surrounded by the circle of animals 
denying itself and arising in new splendor through its selfdenial  the heart of god and of man  it is the one and the many a path leading across mountains and 
valleys a guiding star on the oceans in you and always ahead of you perfected indeed truly perfected is he who knows this perfection is poverty but poverty means 
gratitude gratitude is love  august  in truth perfection is sacrifice  perfection is joy and anticipation of the shadow  perfection is the end the end means the 
beginning and hence perfection is both smallness and the smallest possible beginning  everything is imperfect and pelfection is hence solitude but solitude seeks 
community hence perfection means community  i am perfection but perfected is only he who has attained his limits  i am the eternal light but perfect is he who 
stands between day and night i am eternal love but perfect is he who has placed the sacrificial knife beside his love  i am beauty but perfect is he who sits against the 
temple wall and mends shoes for money  he who is perfect is simple solitary and unanimous hence he seeks diversity community ambiguity through diversity 
community and ambiguity he advances toward simplicity solitude and unanimousness  he who is perfect knows suffering and joy but i am the bliss beyond joy and 
suffering  he who is perfect knows light and dark but i am the light beyond day and darkness  he who is perfect knows up and down but i am the height beyond 
high and low  he who is perfect knows the creating and the created but i am the parturient image beyond creation and creature  he who is perfect knows love and 
being loved but i am the love beyond embrace and mourning  he who is perfect knows male and female but i am the one his father and son beyond masculine and 
feminine beyond child and the aged  he who is perfect knows rise and fall but i am the center beyond dawn and dusk  he who is perfect knows me and hence he is

covered with a black helmet the lionshn of hercules adorns his 
shoulders and he holds the club in his hand he is also wearing 
modern black trousers in honor of the church holiday i bristle 
and stretch out my hand avertingly but the play goes on parsifal 
tales off his helmet yet there is no gurnemanz to atone for and 
consecrate him kundry stands in the distance covering her head 
and laughing the audience is enraptured and recognizes itself 
in parsifal he is i i take off my armor layered with history and 
my chimerical decoration and go to the spring wearing a white 
penitents shirt where i wash my feet and hands without the 
help of a stranger then i also tale off my penitents shirt and 
put on my civilian clothes i walk out of the scene and approach 
myself i who am still kneeling down in prayer as the audience 
i rise and become one with myselfi 
 what would mockery be if it were not true mockery 
what would doubt be if it were not true doubt what would 
opposition be it if were not true opposition he who wants to 
accept himself must also really accept his other but in the yes not 
every no is true and in the no every yes is a lie but since i can be 
in the yes today and in the no tomorrow yes and no are both true 
and untrue whereas yes and no cannot yield because they exist 
our concepts of truth and error can 
i presume you would like to have certainty with regard to truth 
and error certainty within one or the other is not only possible 
but also necessary although certainty in one is protection and 
resistance against the other if you are in one your certainty 
about the one excludes the other but how can you then reach 
the other and why can the one not be enough for us one 
cannot be enough for us since the other is in us and if we 
were content with one the other would suffer great need and 
afflict us with its hunger but we misunderstand this hunger and 
still believe that we are hungry for the one and strive for it even 
more adamantly 
through this we cause the other in us to assert its demands 
on us even more strongly if we are then ready to recognize the 
claim of the other in us we can cross over into the other to satisfy 
it but we can thus reach across since the other has become 
conscious to us yet if our blinding through the one is strong we 
become even more distant from the other and a disastrous chasm 
between the one and the other opens up in us the one becomes 
surfeited and the other becomes too hungry the satiated grows nox qyarta i  
lazy and the hungry grows weak and so we suffocate in fat 
consumed by lack 
this is sickness but you see a lot of this type it must be so 
but it need not be so there are grounds and causes enough that 
it is so but we also want it not  to be so for man is afforded 
the freedom to overcome the cause for he is creative in and of 
himself if you have reached that freedom through the suffering 
of your spirit to accept the other despite your highest belief in 
the one since you are it too then your growth begins 
if others mock me it is nevertheless them doing this and 
i can attribute guilt to them for this and forget to mock myself 
but he who cannot mock himself will be mocked by others 
so accept your selfmockery so that everything divine and heroic 
falls from you and you become completely human what is 
divine and heroic in you is a mockery to the other in you for 
the sake of the other in you set off your admired role which 
you previously performed for your own self and become who 
you are 
he who has the luck and misfortune of a particular talent 
falls prey to believing that he is this gift hence he is also often 
its fool a special gift is something outside of me i am not 
the same as it the nature of the gift has nothing to do with 
the nature of the man who carries it it often even lives at the 
expense of the bearers character his character is marked by 
the disadvantage of his gift indeed even through its opposite 
consequently he is never at the height of his gift but always 
beneath it if he accepts his other he becomes capable of bearing 
his gift without disadvantage but if he only wants to live in 
his gift and consequently rejects his other he oversteps the 
mark since the essence of his gift is extrahuman and a natural 
phenomenon which he in reality is not all the world sees his 
error and he becomes the victim of its mockery then he says 
that others mock him while it is only the disregard of his other 
that makes him ridiculous 
when the god enters my life i return to my poverty for the 
sale of the god i accept the burden of poverty and bear all my 
ugliness and ridiculousness and also everything reprehensible 
in me i thus relieve the god of all the confusion and absurdity 
that would befall him if i did not accept it with this i prepare 
the way for the gods doing what should happen has the 
darkest abyss been emptied and exhausted or what stands and 
waits down there impending and redhot image ii 
 in parsifal wagner presented his reworking of the grail legend the plot runs as follows titurel and his christian knights have the holy grail in their keeping in 
their castle with a sacred spear to guard it klingsor is a sorcerer who seeks the grail he has enticed the keepers of the grail into his magic garden where there are 
flower maidens and the enchantress kundry amfortas titurels son goes into the castle to destroy klingsor but is enchanted by kundry and lets the sacred spear fall 
and klingsor wounds him with it amfortas needs the touch of the spear to heal his wound gurnemanz the oldest of the knights looks after kundry not lmowing 
her role in amfortass wounding a voice from the grail sanctuary prophesies that only a youth who is guileless and innocent can regain the spear parsifal enters having 
killed a swan not knowing his name or the name of his father the knights hope that he is this youth gurnemanz takes him to klingsors castle klingsor orders kundry 
to seduce parsifal parsifal defeats klingsors knights kundry is transformed into a beautiful woman and she kisses him from this he realizes that kundry seduced 
amfortas and he resists her klingsor hurls the spear at him and parsifal seizes it klingsors castle and garden disappear after wandering parsifal finds gurnemanz 
now living as a hermit parsifal is covered in black armor and gurnemanz is offended that he is armed on good friday parsifal lays his spear before him and removes 
his helmet and arms gurnemanz recognizes him and anoints him king of the lmights of the grail parsifal baptizes kundry they go into the castle and ask amfortas 
to uncover the grail amfortas asks them to slay him parsifal enters and touches his wound with the spear amfortas is transfigured and parsifal radiantly holds 
up the grail on may   otto mensendieck gave a presentation to the ziirich psychoanalytical society on the grailparsifal saga in the discussion jung said 
wagners exhaustive treatment of the legend of the holy grail and parsifal would need to be supplemented with the synthetic view that the various figures correspond 
to various artistic aspirations the incest barrier will not serve to explain that kundrys ensnarement fails instead this has to do with the activity of the psyche to 
elevate human aspirations ever higher mzs p  in psychological types  jung put forward a psychological interpretation of parsifal cw

i which fire has not been put out and which embers are still 
ablaze we sacrificed innumerable victims to the dark depths 
and yet it still demands more what is this crazy desire craving 
satisfaction whose mad cries are these who among the dead 
suffers thus come here and drink blood so that you can speak 
why do you reject the blood would you like milk or the red 
juice of the vine perhaps you would rather have love love for 
the dead being in love with the dead are you perhaps demanding 
the seeds of life for the faded thousandyearold body of the 
underworld an unchaste incestuous lust for the dead something 
that makes the blood run cold are you demanding a lusty 
commingling with corpses i spoke of acceptance but you 
demand to seize embrace copulate are you demanding the 
desecration of the dead that prophet you say lay on the child 
and placed his mouth on the childs mouth and his eyes on its 
eyes and his hands on its hands and he thus splays himself over 
the boy so that the childs body became warm but he rose again 
and went here and there in the house before he mounted anew 
and spread himself over him again the boy snorted seven times 
then the boy opened his eyes so shall your acceptance be 
so shall yu accept not cool not superior not thought out 
not obsequious not as a selfchastisement but with pleasure 
precisely with this ambiguous impure pleasure whose ambiguity 
enables it to unite with the higher with that holyevil pleasure 
of which you do not know whether it be virtue or vice with that 
pleasure which is lusty repulsiveness lecherous fear sexual 
immaturity one walens the dead with this pleasure 
your lowest is in a sleep resembling death and needs the 
warmth of life which contains good and evil inseparably and 
indistinguishably that is the way of life you can call it neither 
evil nor good neither pure nor impure yet this is not the goal 
but the way and the crossing it is also sickness and the beginning 
of recovery it is the mother of all abominable deeds and all 
salutary symbols it is the most primordial form of creation the 
very first dark urge that flows through all secret hiding places 
and dark passages with the unintentional lawfulness of water and 
from unexpected places in the loose soil swelling from the finest 
cracks to fructify the dry soil it is the very first secret teacher 
of nature teaching plants and animals the most astonishing and 
supremely clever skills and tricks which we hardly know how 
to fathom it is the great sage who has superhuman knowledge 
who has the greatest of all the sciences who makes order out 
of confusion and who prophesies the future clairvoyantly out of 
ungraspable fullness it is the serpentlile perishable and beneficial 
the dreadfully and ridiculously daimonic it is the arrow that 
always hits the wealest spot the spring root which opens the 
sealed treasure chambers 
you can call it neither clever nor stupid neither good nor evil 
since its nature is inhuman throughout it is the son of the earth 
the dark one whom you should awalen it is man and woman 
at the same time and immature sex rich in interpretation and 
misinterpretation so poor in meaning and yet so rich this is the dead that cried loudest that stood right at the bottom and waited 
that suffered worst it desired neither blood nor milk nor wine 
for the sacrifice of the dead but the willingness of our flesh its 
longing paid no heed to the torment of our spirit which struggled 
and tortured itself to devise what cannot be devised that hence 
tore itself apart and sacrificed itself not until our spirit lay 
dismembered on the altar did i hear the voice of the son of the 
earth and only then did i see that he was the great suffering one 
who needed salvation he is the chosen one since he was the most 
rejected it is bad to have to say this but perhaps i hear badly or 
perhaps i misunderstand what the depths say it is miserable to 
say as much and yet i must say it 
the depths are silent he has arisen and now beholds the light 
of the sun and is among the living restlessness and discord rose 
up with him doubt and the fullness of life 
amen it is finished what was unreal is real what was real is 
unreal however i may not i do not want to i cannot oh human 
wretchedness oh unwillingness in us oh doubt and despair 
this is really good friday upon which the lord died and descended 
into hell and completed the mysteries this is the good friday 
when we complete the christ in us and we descend to hell 
ourselves this the good friday on which we moan and cry to will 
the completion of christ for after his completion we go to hell 
christ was so powerful that his realm covered all the world and 
only hell lay outside it 
who succeeded in crossing the borders of this realm with 
good grounds pure conscience and obeying the law of love 
who among the living is christ and journeys to hell in living 
flesh who is it that expands the realm of christ with hell 
who is it that is full of drunkenness while sober who is it that 
descended from being one into being two who is it that tore 
apart his own heart to unite what has been separated 
i am he the nameless one who does not know himself and 
whose name is concealed even from himself i have no name 
since i have not yet existed but have only just become to myself 
i am an anabaptist and a stranger i who i am am not it but

the three prophecies 
cap xviii 
hi  wondrous things came nearer i called my soul and 
asked her to dive down into the floods whose distant roaring i could 
hear this happened on  january of the year  as recorded 
in my black book and thus she plunged into the darkness like 
a shot and from the depths she called out will you accept what 
i bring the three prophecies i  
i i will accept what you give i do not have the right to judge 
or to reject 
s so listen there is old armor and the rusty gear of our fathers 
down here murderous leather trappings hanging from them 
wormeaten lance shafts twisted spear heads broken arrows rotten 
shields skulls the bones of man and horse old cannons catapults 
crumbling firebrands smashed assault gear stone spearheads 
stone clubs sharp bones chipped arrowhead teeth everything 
the battles of yore have littered the earth with will you accept 
all this 
 i accept it you know better my soul 
s i find painted stones carved bones with magical signs 
talismanic sayings on hanks of leather and small plates of lead 
dirty pouches filled with teeth human hair and fingernails 
timbers lashed together black orbs moldy animal skinsall the 
superstitions hatched by dark prehistory will you accept all this 
 i accept it all how should i dismiss anything 
s but i find worse fratricide cowardly mortal blows torture 
child sacrifice the annihilation of whole peoples arson betrayal 
war rebellionwill you also accept this 
i also this if it must be how can i judge 
s i find epidemics natural catastrophes sunken ships razed 
cities frightful feral savagery famines human meanness and fear 
whole mountains of fear 
i so shall it be since you give it 
s i find the treasures of all past cultures magnificent images 
of gods spacious temples paintings papyrus rolls sheets of 
parchment with the characters of bygone languages books full 
of lost wisdom hymns and chants of ancient priests stories told 
down the ages through thousands of generations 
i that is an entire world whose extent i cannot grasp how 
can i accept it 
s but you wanted to accept everything you do not know 
your limits can you not limit yourself 
 the drqft continues i put many people books and thoughts aside for his sake but even more i withdrew from the current world and did the plain and simple and 
what suggested it most immediately to serve his secret purpose by serving him the dark one i encounter another on the path of mercy if intentions and wishes torment 
me i think feel and do what lies closest thus what is most remote reaches me p  
 in  in psychology und alchemy jung referred to an alchemical representation of a circle quadrated by four rivers in the context of a discussion of mandala symbolism 
cw  n jung commented on the four rivers of paradise on a number of occasionssee for instance aion cw   ii    
 inscription xi mcmxix ii  this date seems to refer to when this image was painted this stone set so beautifully is certainly the lapis philosophorum 
it is harder than diamond but it expands into space through four distinct qualities namely breadth height depth and time it is hence invisible and you can pass 
through it without noticing it the four streams of aquarius flow from the stone this is the incorruptible seed that lies between the father and the mother and prevents 
the heads of both cones from touching it is the monad which countervails the pleroma on the pleroma see below p concerning the reference to the incorruptible 
seed see the dialogue with ha in the note to image  p  n  above 
 on june  jungs soul described philemon as the joy of the earth the daimons become reconciled in the one who has found himself who is the source of all 
four streams of the sourcebearing earth from his summit waters flow in all four directions he is the sea that bears the sun he is the mountain that carries the sun 
he is the father of all four great streams he is the cross that binds the four great daimons he is the incorruptible seed of nothingness which falls accidentally through 
space this seed is the beginning younger than all other beginnings older than all endings black book  p  some of the motifs in this statement may have some 
connections with this image there is a gap between july  and february  in black book  during which time jung was presumably writing psychological types 
on february  he made the following entry what lies between appears in the book of dreams but even more in the images of the red book p  in dreams 
jung noted around eight dreams during this period and a vision at night in august  of two angels a dark transparent mass and a young woman this suggests 
that the symbolic process continues in the paintings in the calligraphic volume which do not appear to have direct crossreferences to either the text in liber novus 
or the black books in  jung put forward a psychological interpretation of the symbolism of medieval alchemy viewing the philosophers stonethe goal of the 
alchemical opusas a symbol of the self psychology and alchemy cw  
 inscription  december mcmxix december  this date seems to refer to when the image was painted this is the back side of the gem he who is in 
the stone has this shadow this is atmavictu the old one after he has withdrawn from the creation he has returned to endless history where he took his beginning 
once more he became stony residue having completed his creation in the form of izdubar he has outgrown and delivered iiahmqn and ka from him iiahmqn 
gave the stone ka the  the final character appears to be the astrological symbol for the sun 
 on atmavictu see note to image iion may   philemon said as atmavictu i committed the error and became human my name was izdubar i approached 
him as just that he paralyzed me yes man paralyzed me and turned me into a dragons serpent fortunately i recognized my error and the fire consumed the serpent 
and thus philemon came into being my form is appearance previously my appearance was form black book  p  in memories jung said later philemon 
became relativized by yet another figure whom i called ka in ancient egypt the icings ka was his earthly form the embodied soul in my fantasy the kasoul came 
from below out of the earth as out of a deep shaft i did a painting of him showing him in his earthbound form as a herm with base of stone and upper part of 
bronze high up in the painting appears a kingfishers wing and between it and the head of ka floats a round glowing nebula of stars kas expression has something 
demonic about itone might also say mephistophelian in one hand he holds something like a colored pagoda or a reliquary and in the other a stylus with which he 
is working on the reliquary he is saying i am he who buries the gods in gold and gems philemon has a lame foot but was a winged spirit whereas ka represented 
a kind of earth demon or metal demon philemon was the spiritual aspect the meaning ka on the other hand was a spirit of nature like the anthroparion of greek 
alchemywith which at that time i was still unfamiliar ka was he who made everything real but who also obscured the kingfisher spirit the meaning or replaced it 
by beauty the eternal reflection in time i was able to integrate both figures through the study of alchemy pp io wallace budge notes that the ka was an 
abstract individuality or personality which possessed the form and attributes of the man to whom it belonged and though its normal dwelling place was in the tomb 
with the body it could wander at will it was independent of the man and could go and dwell in any statue of him egyptian book of the dead plxv in  jung 
commented at a rather higher stage of development where the idea of the soul already exists not all the images continue to be projected  but one or the other 
complex has come near enough to consciousness to be felt as no longer strange but as somehow belonging nevertheless the feeling that it belongs is not at first 
sufficiently strong for the complex to be sensed as a subjective content of consciousness it remains in a sort of nomansland between consciousness and the unconscious 
in the halfshadow in part belonging or akin to the conscious subject in part an autonomous being and meeting consciousness as such at all events it is not necessarily

 i liber secundus  
l i must limit myself who could ever grasp such wealth 
s be content and cultivate your garden with modesty 
l i will i see that it is not worth conquering a larger piece 
of the immeasurable but a smaller one instead a welltended 
small garden is better than an illtended large garden both 
gardens are equally small when faced with the immeasurable 
but unequally cared for 
s take shears and prune your trees 
 from the flooding darkness the son of the earth had 
brought my soul gave me ancient things that pointed to the 
future she gave me three things the misery of war the darkness 
of magic and the gift of religion 
if you are clever you will understand that these three things 
belong together these three mean the unleashing of chaos and 
its power just as they also mean the binding of chaos war is 
obvious and everybody sees it magic is dark and no one sees 
it religion is still to come but it will become evident did you 
think that the horrors of such atrocious warfare would come 
over us did you think that magic existed did you think about 
a new religion i sat up for long nights and looked ahead at what 
was to come and i shuddered do you believe me i am not too 
concerned what should i believe what should i disbelieve i 
saw and i shuddered 
but my spirit could not grasp the monstrous and could not 
conceive the extent of what was to come the force of my longing 
languished and powerless sank the harvesting hands i felt the 
burden of the most terrible work of the times ahead i saw where 
and how but no word can grasp it no will can conquer it i could 
not do otherwise i let it sink again into the depths 
i cannot give it to you and i can speak only of the way of what 
is to come little good will come to you from outside what will 
come to you lies within yourself but what lies there i would like 
to avert my eyes close my ears and deny all my senses i would like 
to be someone among you who knows nothing and who never saw 
anything it is too much and too unexpected but i saw it and my 
memory will not leave me alone yet i curtail my longing which 
would like to stretch out into the future and i return to my small 
garden that presently blooms and whose extent i can measure it 
shall be welltended the future should be left to those of the future i return to 
the small and the real for this is the great way the way of what 
is to come i return to my simple reality to my undeniable and 
most minuscule being and i take a knife and hold court over 
everything that has grown without measure and goal forests have 
grown around me winding plants have climbed up me and i am 
completely covered by endless proliferation the depths are inex
haustible they give everything everything is as good as nothing 
keep a little and you have something to recognize and lmow your 
ambition and your greed to gather  image   your craving 
to cultivate it grasp it make it serviceable influence it master it 
order it to give it interpretations and meanings is extravagant 
it is lunacy like everything that transcends its boundaries 
how can you hold that which you are not would you really like 
to force everything which you are not under the yoke of your 
wretched knowledge and understanding remember that you can 
know yoursel and with that you lmow enough but you cannot 
know others and everything else beware of knowing what lies 
beyond yoursel or else your presumed knowledge will suffocate 
the life of those who know themselves a knower may know 
himself that is his limit 
with a painful slice i cut off what i pretended to know about 
what lies beyond me i excise myself from the cunning interpretive 
loops that i gave to what lies beyond me and my knife cuts even 
deeper and separates me from the meanings that i conferred upon 
myself i cut down to the marrow until everything meaningful 
falls from me until i am no longer as i might seem to mysel until 
i know only that i am without knowing what i am 
i want to be poor and bare and i want to stand naked before 
the inexorable i want to be my body and its poverty i want to be 
from the earth and live its law i want to be my human animal and 
accept all its frights and desires i want to go through the wail
ing and the blessedness of the one who stood alone with a poor 
unarmed body on the sunlit earth a prey of his drives and of the 
lurking wild animals who was terrified by ghosts and dreaming 
of distant gods who belonged to what was near and was enemy 
to the faroff who struck fire from stones and whose herds were 
stolen by unlmowable powers that also destroyed the crops of his 
fields and who neither lmew nor recognized but who lived by 
what lay at hand and received by grace what lay faroff 
obedient to the subjects intentions it may even be of a higher order more often than not a source of inspiration or warning or of supernatural information 
psychologically such a content could be explained as a partly autonomous complex that is not yet fully integrated the primitive souls the egyptian ba and ka are 
complexes of this kind the relations between the i and the unconscious cw   in  jung described the anthroparion in alchemy as a type of goblin that 
as tveuhx napeopov devoted spirit spiritus familiaris stands by the adept in his work and helps the physician to heal mysterium coniunctionis cw   the 
anthroparion was seen to represent the alchemical metals on the psychology of the child archetype cw  i  and appeared in the visions of zosimos cw 
 pp  the painting ofka that jung refers to has not come to light ka appeared to jung in a fantasy on october  where he introduced himself as the 
other side of ha his soul it was ka who had given ha the runes and the lower wisdom see note  p  his eyes are of pure gold and his body is of black iron 
he tells jung and his soul that they need his secret which is the essence of all magic this is love philemon says that ka is philemons shadow black book  p ff 
on november  ka calls philemon his shadow and his herald ka says that he is eternal and remains while philemon is fleeting and passes on p  on february 
ro  ka says that he has built a temple as a prison and grave for the gods p  ka features in black book  until  during this period jung attempts to 
understand the connection among ka philemon and the other figures and to establish the right relation to them on october  jung discussed an unidentified 
picture with constance long who was in analysis with him some of the comments she noted shed light on his understanding of the relation of philemon and ka 
the  figures on either side are personifications of dominants fathers the one is the creative father ka the other philemon that one whom gives form and law the 
formative instinct ka would equal dionysus  p  apollo philemon gives formulation to the things within elements of the collective unc  philemon gives 
the idea maybe of a god but it remains floating distant  indistinct because all the things he invents are winged but ka gives substance  is called the one who 
buries the gods in gold  marble he has a tendency to misprison them in matter  so they are in danger of losing their spiritual meaning  becoming buried in 
stone so the temple maybe the grave of god as the church has become the grave of xt the more the church develops the more xt dies ka must not be allowed to 
produce too muchyou must not depend on substantiation but if too little substance is produced the creature floats the transcendent function is the whole not 
this picture nor my rationalization of it but the new and vivifying creative spirit that is the result of the intercourse between the consc intelligence and the creative 
side ka is sensation p is intuition he is too suprahuman he is zarathustra extravagantly superior in what he says  cold cgj has not printed the questions 
he addressed to p nor his answers  ka  philemon are bigger than the man they are suprahuman disintegrated into them one is in the col unc diary 
countway library of medicine pp  
 inscription iv jan mcmxx uanuary  this date seems to refer to when the image was painted this is the caster of holy water the cabiri grow out of the 
flowers which spring from the body of the dragon above is the temple 
 in black book  jung noted thereafter i walk on like a man who is tense and who expects something new that he has never suspected before i listen to the depths
warned instructed and undauntedoutwardly striving to lead a full human life p 
 these lines refer to the end of voltaires candide wi that is well saidbut we must cultivate our garden candide and other stories tr r pearson oxford oxford 
university press  pp  jung kept a bust of voltaire in his study 
 the drqft continues how can i fathom what will happen during the next eight hundred years up to the time when the one begins his rule i am speaking only of 
what is to come p  
 the scene in the landscape resembles one of jungs waldng fantasies during his childhood in which alsace is submerged by water basle is turned into a port there is a

he was a child and unsure yet full of certainty weak and yet 
blessed with enormous strength when his god did not help he 
took another and when this one did not help either he castigated 
him and behold the gods helped one more time thus i discard 
everything that was laden with meaning everything divine and 
devilish with which chaos burdened me truly it is not up to me 
to prove the gods and the devils and the chaotic monsters to feed 
them carefully to warily drag them with me to count and name 
them and to protect them with belief against disbelief and doubt 
a free man knows only free gods and devils that are self
contained and take effect on account of their own force if they 
fail to have an effect that is their own business and i can 
remove this burden from myself but if they are effective they 
need neither my protection nor my care nor my belief thus you 
may wait quietly to see whether they work but if they do be 
clever for the tiger is stronger than you you should be able to 
cast everything from you otherwise you are a slave even if you 
are the slave of a god life is free and chooses its way it is limited 
enough so do not pile up more limitation hence i cut away 
everything confining i stood here and there lay the riddlesome 
multifariousness of the world 
and a horror crept over me am i not the tightly bound is 
the world there not the unlimited and i became aware of my 
weakness what would poverty nakedness and unpreparedness 
be without consciousness of weakness and without horror at 
powerlessness thus i stood and was terrified and then my soul 
whispered to me 
the gift of magic 
cap xix 
hi   do you not hear something 
i im not aware of anything what should i hear 
s ringing 
i ringing what i hear nothing 
s listen harder 
i perhaps something in the left ear what could it mean 
s misfortune 
i i accept what you say i want to have fortune and misfortune 
s well then raise your hands and receive what comes to you 
i what is it a rod a black serpent a black rod formed 
like a serpentwith two pearls as eyesa gold bangle around its 
neck is it not like a magical rod 
s it is a magical rod 
i what should i do with magic is the magical rod a 
misfortune is magic a misfortune 
s yes for those who possess it 
i that sounds like the sayings of oldhow strange you are 
my soul what should i do with magic 
s magic will do a lot for you 
i im afraid that youre stirring up my desire and misunder
standing you know that man never stops craving the black art 
and things that cost no effort 
 january  ii the gift of magic i  
s magic is not easy and it demands sacrifice 
i does it demand the sacrifice of love of humanity if it 
does take the rod back 
s dont be rash magic doesnt demand that sacrifice it 
demands another sacrifice 
i what sacrifice is that 
s the sacrifice that magic demands is solace 
i solace do i understand correctly understanding you is 
unspeakably difficult tell me what does this mean 
s solace is to be sacrificed 
i what do yo mean should the solace that i give or the 
solace that i receive be sacrificed 
s both 
i im confused this is too dark 
s you must sacrifice solace for the sake of the black rod the 
solace you give and the solace you receive 
i re you saying that i shouldnt be allowed to receive the 
solace of those i love and should give no solace to those i love 
this means the loss of a piece of humanity and what one calls 
severity toward oneself and others takes its place 
s that is how it is 
i does the rod demand this sacrifice 
s it demands this sacrifice 
i can i am i allowed to make this sacrifice for the sake of 
the rod must i accept the rod 
s do you want to or not 
i i cant say what do i know about the black rod who gives 
it to me 
s the darkness that lies before you it is the next thing that 
comes to you will you accept it and offer it your sacrifice 
i it is hard to sacrifice to the dark to the blind darknessand 
what a sacrifice 
s naturedoes nature offer solace does it accept solace 
i you venture a heavy word what solitude are you asking 
of me 
s this is your misfortune andthe power of the black rod 
i how gloomily and full of foreboding you speak are you 
sheathing me in the armor  image   of icy severity are 
you clasping my heart with a bronze carapace im happy with 
the warmth of life should i miss it for the sake of magic 
what is magic 
s you dont know magic so dont judge what are you 
bristling at 
i magic what should i do with magic i dont believe in it i 
cant believe in it my heart sinksand im supposed to sacrifice 
a greater part of my humanity to magic 
s i advise you dont struggle against this and above all dont 
act so enlightened as if deep down you did not believe in magic 
i youre inexorable but i cant believe in magic or maybe i 
have a completely false idea of it 
s yes i gather that from what youre saying cast aside 
your blind judgment and critical gesture otherwise youll never 
understand do you still mean to waste years waiting 
i be patient my science has not yet been overcome 
s high time that you overcame it

oneself tr r j hollingdale harmondsworth penguin i foreword  p  
 inscription on top mor triumphat inscription at bottom this image was completed on  january ii after it had waited incomplete for  months it expresses 
i know not what kind of grief a fourfold sacrifice i could almost choose not to finish it it is the inexorable wheel of the four functions the essence of all living beings 
imbued with sacrifice the functions are those of thinking feeling sensation and intuition which jung wrote about in psychological types i on february  
i jung noted in black book  what occurs between the lover and the beloved is the entire fullness of the godhead both are unfathomable riddles to each other 
for who understands the godhead  but the god is born in solitude from the secret  mystery of the individual  the separation between life and love is the con
tradiction between solitude and togetherness p  the next entry in black book  is on september   on march  i jung went to north africa with his

 i liber secundus  
i you ask a great deal almost too much after allis science 
essential to life is science life there are people who live without 
science but to overcome science for the salce of magic thats 
uncanny and menacing 
s re you afraid dont you want to risk life isnt it life that 
presents you with this problem 
i l this leaves me so dazed and confused wont you give me 
an enlightening word 
s oh so its solace you long for do you want the rod or 
dont you 
i you tear my heart to pieces i want to submit to life but 
how difficult this is i want the black rod because it is the first 
thing the darkness grants me i dont know what this rod means 
nor what it givesi only feel what it takes i want to kneel down 
and receive this messenger of darkness i have received the black 
rod and now i hold it the enigmatic one in my hand it is cold 
and heavy like iron the pearl eyes of the serpent look at me 
blindly and dazzlingly what do you want mysterious gift all the 
darkness of all former worlds crowds together in you you hard 
black piece of steel are you time and fate the essence of nature 
hard and eternally inconsolable yet the sum of all mysterious 
creative force primordial magic words seem to emanate from 
you mysterious effects weave around you and what powerful arts 
slumber in you you pierce me with unbearable tensionwhat 
grimaces will you make what terrible mystery will you create 
will you bring bad weather storms cold thunder and lightning 
or will you make the fields fruitful and bless the bodies of pregnant 
women what is the mark of your being or dont you need that 
you son of the dark womb do you content yourself with the 
hazy darkness whose concretion and crystal you are where in 
my soul do i shelter you in my heart should my heart be your 
shrine your holy of holies so choose your place i have accepted 
you what crushing tension you bring with you isnt the bow of 
my nerves breaking ive taken in the messenger of the night 
s the most powerful magic lives in it 
i i feel it and yet cant put into words the nightmarish power 
granted to it i wanted to laugh because so much alters in laugh
ter and resolves itself only there but laughter dies in me the 
magic of this rod is as solid as iron and as cold as death forgive 
me my soul i dont want to be impatient but it seems to me that 
something has got to happen to break through this unbearable 
tension that came with the rod 
s wait keep your eyes and ears open 
 im shuddering and i dont know why 
s sometimes one must shudder beforethe greatest 
i i bow my soul before unknown forcesid like to consecrate 
an altar to each unknown god i must submit the black iron 
in my heart gives me secret power its like defiance and like
contempt for men 
 oh dark act violation murder abyss give birth to the 
unredeemed who is our redeemer who our leader where are 
the ways through black wastes god do not abandon us what 
are you summoning god raise your hand up to the darkness above you pray despair wring your hands kneel press your 
forehead into the dust cry out but do not name him do not 
look at him leave him without name and form what should 
form the formless name the nameless step onto the great way 
and grasp what is nearest do not look out do not want but lift 
up your hands the gifts of darkness are full of riddles the way 
is open to whomever can continue in spite of riddles submit 
to the riddles and the thoroughly incomprehensible there are 
dizzying  image   bridges over the eternally deep abyss 
but follow the riddles 
endure them the terrible ones it is still dark and the terrible 
goes on growing lost and swallowed by the streams of procreating 
life we approach the overpowering inhuman forces that are busily 
creating what is to come how much future the depths carry are 
not the threads spun down there over millennia protect the 
riddles bear them in your heart warm them be pregnant with 
them thus you carry the future 
the tension of the future is unbearable in us it must brealc 
through narrow cracks it must force new ways you want to cast 
off the burden you want to escape the inescapable running away 
is deception and detour shut your eyes so that you do not see the 
manifold the outwardly plural the tearing away and the tempting 
there is only one way and that is your way there is only one salva
tion and that is your salvation why are you looking around for 
help do you believe that help will come from outside what is to 
come is created in you and from you hence look into yourself do 
not compare do not measure no other way is wee yours all other 
ways deceive and tempt you you must fulfill the way that is in you 
oh that all men and all their ways become strange to you 
thus might you find them again within yourself and recognize 
their ways but what weakness what doubt what fear you will 
not bear going your way you always want to have at least one foot 
on paths not your own to avoid the great solitude so that maternal 
comfort is always with you so that someone acknowledges you 
recognizes you bestows trust in you comforts you encourages 
you so that someone pulls you over onto their path where you 
stray from yourself and where it is easier for you to set yourself 
aside as if you were not yourself who should accomplish your 
deeds who should carry your virtues and your vices you do not 
come to an end with your life and the dead will besiege you 
terribly to live your unlived life everything must be fulfilled 
time is of the essence so why do you want to pile up the lived 
and let the unlived rot 
great is the power of the way in it heaven and hell grow 
together and in it the power of the below and the power of the 
above unite the nature of the way is magical as are supplication 
and invocation malediction and deed are magical if they occur 
on the great way magic is the working of men on men but your 
magic action does not affect your neighbor it affects you first and 
only if you withstand it does an invisible effect pass from you to 
your neighbor there is more of it in the air than i ever thought 
however it cannot be grasped listen 
 in black book  jung noted soul tame your impatience only waiting will help you here i waiting i know this word hercules also found waiting trouble
some when he carried the weight of the world on his shoulders soul he had to await atlass return and carried the weight of the world for the sake of the apples 
p o the reference is to the eleventh labor of hercules in which he has to get the golden apples which confer immortality atlas offered to get them for him if he 
held up the world in the interim 
 in greek mythology the moirae or three fates clotho lachesis and atropus spun and controlled the threads of human life in norse mythology the norns spun the 
threads of fate at the foot of yggsdrasil the world tree 
 the drqft continues the power of the way is so great that it carries away others and ignites them you do not know how this happens hence it is best you call this 
effect magical p 
 the drqft continues which is represented as a serpent precisely on account of its particular nature p 
 this appears to refer to the magical circle in which ritual acts are performed 
 in matthew  christ rebukes his disciples for having been unable to remain awake for an hour while he prayed in the garden of gethsemane

a solitary is cooking up healing potions 
he makes ojfering to the four winds 
he greets the stars and touches the earth 
he holds something luminous in his hand 
flowers sprout around him and the bliss of a new spring kisses all his limbs 
birds fly around and the shy animals of the forest gaze at him 
he is far from men and yet the threads of their fate pass through his hands 
may your intercession be meant for him so that his medicine grows ripe 
and strong and brings healing to the deepest wounds 
for your sake he is solitary and waits alone between heaven and earthfor 
the earth to rise up to him and for heaven to come down to him 
all peoples are still far off and stand behind the wall of darkness 
but i hear his words which reach me from afar 
he has chosen a poor scribe someone hard ofhearing who also stutters 
when he writes 
i do not recognize him the solitary what is he saying he says i suffer 
fear and distress for the sake of man 
i dug up old runes and magical sayings for words never reach men words 
have become shadows 
therefore i took old magical apparatuses and prepared hot potions and mixed 
in secrets and ancient powers things that even the cleverest would not guess at 
i stewed the roots of all human thoughts and deeds 
i watched over the cauldron through many starry nights the brew fer 
ments forever i need your intercession your kneeling your desperation and your 
patience i need your ultimate and highest longing your purest willing your 
most humble subjugation 
solitary who are you waitingfor whose help do you require there is none 
who can rush to your aid since all look to you and wait for your healing art 
we are all utterly incapable and need help more than you grant us help 
so that we can help you in return 
the solitary speaks will no one stand by me in this need should i leave 
my work to help you so that you can help me again but how should i help 
you if my brew has not grown ripe and strong it was supposed to help you 
what do you hope from mejj 
come to us why are you standing there cooking up marvels what can 
your healing and magical potion do for us do you believe in healing potions 
look at life behold how much it needs you  image   
the solitary speaks fools can you not keep watch with me for an 
hour until the difficult and longlasting achieves completion and the juice 
has ripened 
just a little longer and fermentation will be complete why cant you 
wait why should your impatience destroy the highest opusjj 
what highest opus we are not alive cold and numbness have seized 
us your opus solitary one will not be finished for aeons even if it advances 
day after day 
the work of salvation is endless why do you want to wait for the end of 
this work even if your waiting turned you into stone for endless ages you the way of the cross i  
could not endure till the end and if your salvation came to its end you would 
have to be saved from your salvation again 
the solitary speaks what smoothtongued lamentation reaches my ears 
what whining what foolish doubters you are unruly children persevere 
it will be accomplished after this night 
we will not wait a single night longer we have persevered long enough 
are you a god that a thousand nights are as one night to you for us this 
one night would be like a thousand nights abandon the work ofsalvation and 
we will be saved what stretch of ages are you saving us for 
the solitary speaks you embarrassing human swarm you foolish 
bastard of god and cattle im still lacking a piece of your precious flesh for 
my mixture am i truly your most valuable piece of meat is it worth my 
while to come to the boil for you one let himselfbe nailed to the cross for 
you one is truly enough he blocks my way therefore neither will i walk 
on his ways nor make for you any healing brew or immortal blood potion 
but rather i will abandon the potion and cauldron and occult work for your 
sake since you can neither wait for nor endure the fulfillment i throw down 
your intercession your genuflection your invocations you can save your 
selves from both your lack of salvation and your salvation your worth rose 
quite high enough because one died for you now prove your worth by each 
living for himself my god how difficult it is to leave a wok unfinished 
for the sake of men but for the sake of men i abstain from being a savior 
lo now my potion has completed its fermentation i did not mix a piece of 
myself into the drink but i did slice in a piece of humanity and behold it 
clarified the murky foaming potion 
h ow sweet how bitter the form of the one 
it tastes becomes double

the levels are broad ways 
patient streets night covers the sky and far 
below lies the black earth 
the bubbling pot grows cold 
day approaches and above the clouds a distant sun 
no solitary cooks healing potions 
the four winds blow and laugh at their bounty 
and he mocks the four winds 
he has seen the stars and touched the earth 
therefore his hand clasps something luminous 
and his shadow has grown to heaven image  
the inexplicable occurs you would very much like to forsake 
yourself and defect to each and every manifold possibility you 
would very much like to risk every crime in order to steal for 
yourself the mystery of the changeful but the road is without end

 i liber secundus  
become white it wound itself around the head of the dead one 
like a diadem and a light gleamed above his head and the sun 
rose shining in the east i stood and watched and was confused 
and a great weight burdened my soul but the white bird that 
sat on my shoulder spoke to me let it rain let the wind blow 
let the waters flow and the fire burn let each thing have its 
development let becoming have its day 
  truly the way leads through the crucified that means 
through him to whom it was no small thing to live his own life 
and who was therefore raised to magnificence he did not simply 
teach what was knowable and worth knowing he lived it it is 
unclear how great ones humility must be to take it upon oneself 
to live ones own life the disgust of whoever wants to enter 
into his own life can hardly be measured aversion wi sicken 
him he makes himself vomit his bowels pain him and his brain 
sinks into lassitude he would rather devise any trick to help him 
escape since nothing matches the torment of ones own way it 
seems impossibly difficult so difficult that nearly anything seems 
preferable to this torment not a few choose even to love people 
for fear of themselves i believe too that some commit a crime 
to pick a quarrel with themselves therefore i cling to everything 
that obstructs my way to myself 
 he who goes to himsel climbs down pathetic and ridicu
lous forms appeared to the greatest prophet who came before 
this time and these were the forms of his own essence he did 
not accept them but exorcized them before others ultimately 
however he was forced to celebrate a last supper with his own 
poverty and to accept these forms of his own essence out of 
compassion which is precisely that acceptance of the lowest in 
us but this enraged the mighty lion who chased down the lost 
and restored it to the darkness of the depths and like all those 
with power the one with the great name wanted to erupt from the 
womb of the mountain like the sun but what happened to him 
his way led him before the crucified and he began to rage he raged 
against the man of mockery and pain because the power of his own 
essence forced him to follow precisely this way as christ had 
done before us yet he loudly proclaimed his power and great
ness no one speaks louder of his power and greatness than he 
from whom the earth disappears under his feet ultimately the 
lowest in him got to him his incapacity and this crucified his 
spirit so that as he himself had predicted his soul died before 
his body   no one rises above himself who has not turned his most 
dangerous weapon against himself one who wants to rise above 
himself shall climb down and hoist himself onto himself and lug 
himself to the place of sacrifice but what must happen to a man 
until he realizes that outer visible success that he can grasp with 
his hands  leads him astray what suffering must be brought 
upon humanity until man gives up satisfying his longing for 
power over his few man and forever wanting others to be the 
same how much blood must go on flowing until man opens his 
eyes and sees the way to his own path and himself as the enemy 
and becomes aware of his real success you ought to be able to 
live with yoursel but not at your neighbors expense the herd 
animal is not his brothers parasite and pest man you have even 
forgotten that you too are an animal you actually sti seem to 
believe that life is better elsewhere woe unto you if your neighbor 
also thinks so but you may be sure that he does someone must 
begin to stop being childish 
 your craving satisfies itself in you you can offer no more 
precious a sacrificial meal to your god than yourself may your 
greed consume you for this wearies and calms it and you wi 
sleep we and consider the sun of each day as a gift if you devour 
other things and other people your greed remains eternally 
dissatisfied for it craves more the most costlyit craves you 
and thus you compel your desire to take your own way you 
may ask others provided that you need help and advice but you 
should make demands on no one neither desiring nor expect
ing anything from anyone except from yourself for your craving 
satisfies itself only within you you are afraid of burning in your 
own fire may nothing prevent you from doing so neither anyone 
elses sympathy nor your more dangerous sympathy with yourself 
since you should live and die with yourself 
 when the flame of your greed consumes you and nothing 
remains of you but ash so nothing of you was steadfast yet the 
flame in which you consumed yourself has iuminated many but 
if you flee from your fire fu of fear you scorch your few men 
and the burning torment of your greed cannot die out so long as 
you do not desire yourself 
the mouth utters the word the sign and the symbol if the 
word is a sign it means nothing but if the word is a symbol it 
means everything when the way enters death and we are 
surrounded by rot and horror the way rises in the darkness and 
leaves the mouth as the saving symbol the word it leads the sun 
on high for in the symbol there is the release of the bound human 
 in black book  this is spoken by his soul in this chapter and in scrutinies we find a shift in the attribution of some statements in the black books from the soul to the 
other characters this textual revision marks an important psychological process of differentiating the characters separating them out from one another and disiden
tifying from them jung discussed this process in general in  in the relations between the i and the unconscious ch  the technique for differentiation between the i 
and the figures of the unconscious cw  in black book  the soul explains to jung in  if i am not conjoined through the uniting of the below and the above 
i break down into three parts the serpent and in that or some other animal form i roam living nature daimonically arousing fear and longing the human soul living 
forever within you the celestial soul as such dwelling with the gods far from you and unknown to you appearing in the form of a bird appendix c p  the 
textual changes that jung makes among the soul the serpent and the bird from the black books in this chapter and in scrutinies can be seen to be the recognition and 
differentiation of the threefold nature of the soul jungs notion of the unity and multiplicity of the soul resembles eckharts in sermon  eckhart wrote the soul 
with her higher powers touches eternity which is god while her lower powers being in touch with time make her subject to change and biased toward bodily things 
which degrade her sermons  treatises vol  tr m oe walshe london watkins  p  in sermon  he wrote three things prevent the soul from uniting 
with god the first is that she is too scattered and that she is not unitary for when the soul is inclined toward creatures she is not unitary the second is when she is 
involved with temporal things the third is when she is turned toward the body for then she cannot unite with god ibid p  
 the drift continues  why you ask does man not want to reach himself the raging prophet who preceded this time wrote a book about this and embellished it 
with a proud name the book is about how and why man does not want to reach himself p  the reference is to nietzsches thus spoke zarathustra 
 see the last supper thus spoke zarathustra p  
 in the last chapter of thus spoke zarathustra the sign when the higher men come to meet zarathustra in his cave the lion started violently suddenly turned away 
from zarathustra and leaped up to the cave roaring fiercely p  in  jung noted the roaring of the zarathustrian lion drove all the higher men who were 
clamoring for experience back again into the cavern of the unconscious hence his life does not convince us of his teaching the unconscious in normal and sick psychic 
life cw   
 nietzsche ends thus spoke zarathustra with the lines thus spoke zarathustra and left his cave glowing and strong like a morning sun emerging from behind dark 
clouds p  
 in zarathustras prologue a tightrope walker falls from a rope zarathustra says to the injured tightrope walker your soul will be dead even before your body therefore 
fear nothing any more zarathustra   as underlined in jungs copy p  in  jung argued that this was prophetic of nietzsches own fate the unconscious in 
normal and sick psychic life cw

force struggling with darkness our freedom does not lie outside 
us but within us one can be bound outside and yet one will still 
feel free since one has burst inner bonds one can certainly gain 
outer freedom through powerful actions but one creates inner 
freedom only through the symbol 
 the symbol is the word that goes out of the mouth that one 
does not simply speak but that rises out of the depths of the self 
as a word of power and great need and places itself unexpect
edlyon the tongue it is an astonishing and perhaps seemingly 
irrational word but one recognizes it as a symbol since it is alien 
to the conscious mind if one accepts the symbol it is as if a door 
opens leading into a new room whose existence one previously 
did not know but if one does not accept the symbol it is as if one 
carelessly went past this door and since this was the only door 
leading to the inner chambers one must pass outside into the 
streets again exposed to everything external but the soul suffers 
great need since outer freedom is of no use to it salvation is a 
long road that leads through many gates these gates are symbols 
each new gate is at first invisible indeed it seems at first that  
it must be created for it exists only if one has dug up the springs 
root the symbol 
to find the mandrake one needs the black dog since good 
and bad must always be united first if the symbol is to be created 
the symbol can be neither thought up nor found it becomes 
its becoming is like the becoming of human life in the womb 
pregnancy comes about through voluntary copulation it goes on 
through willing attention but if the depths have conceived then 
the symbol grows out of itself and is born from the mind as befits 
a god but in the same way a mother would like to throw herself 
on the child like a monster and devour it again 
in the morning when the new sun rises the word steps out of 
my mouth but is murdered lovelessly since i did not know that 
it was the savior the newborn child grows quickly if i accept 
it and immediately it becomes my charioteer the word is the 
guide the middle way which easily oscillates like the needle on 
the scales the word is the god that rises out of the waters each 
morning and proclaims the guiding law to the people outer laws 
and outer wisdom are eternally insufficient since there is only 
one law and one wisdom namely my daily law my daily wisdom 
the god renews himself each night 
the god appears in multiple guises for when he emerges he 
has assumed some of the character of the night and the nightly 
waters in which he slumbered and in which he struggled for 
renewal in the last hour of the night consequently his appear
ance is twofold and ambiguous indeed it even tears at the heart 
and the mind on emerging the god calls me toward the right 
and the left his voice calling out to me from both sides yet the 
god wants neither the one nor the other he wants the middle 
way but the middle is the beginning of the long road 
man however can never see this beginning he always sees 
only one and not the other or the other and not the one but the way of the cross i ii 
never that which the one as well as the other encloses in itself 
the point of origin is where the mind and the will stand still it 
is a state of suspension that evokes my outrage my defiance and 
eventually my greatest fear for i can see nothing anymore and 
can no longer want anything or at least that is how it seems to 
me the way is a highly peculiar standstill of everything that was 
previously movement it is a blind waiting a doubtful listening 
and groping one is convinced that one will burst but the reso
lution is born from precisely this tension and it almost always 
appears where one did not expect it 
but what is tht resolution it is always something ancient and 
precisely because of this something new for when something long 
since passed away comes back again in a changed world it is new 
to give birth to the ancient in a new time is creation this is the 
creation of the new and that redeems me salvation is the resolution 
of the task the task is to give birth to the old in a new time the 
soul of humanity is like the great wheel of the zodiac that rolls 
along the way everything that comes up in a constant movement 
from below to the heights was already there there is no part of 
the wheel that does not come around again hence everything 
that has been streams upward there and what has been will be 
again for these are all things which are the inborn properties of 
human nature it belongs to the essence of forward movement 
that what was returns only the ignorant can marvel at this yet 
the meaning does not lie in the eternal recurrence of the same 
but in the manner of its recurring creation at any given time 
the meaning lies in the manner and the direction of the 
recurring creation but how do i create my charioteer or do i 
want to be my own charioteer i can guide myself only with will 
and intention but will and intention are simply part of myself 
consequently they are insufficient to express my wholeness 
intention is what i can foresee and willing is to want a foreseen 
goal but where do i find the goal i take it from what is presently 
known to me thus i set the present in place of the future in this 
 manner though i cannot reach the future i artificially produce 
a constant present everything that would like to break into this 
present strikes me as a disturbance and i seek to drive it away so 
that my intention survives thus i close off the progress of life 
but how can i be my own charioteer without will and intention 
therefore a wise man does not want to be a charioteer for he 
knows that will and intention certainly attain goals but disturb 
the becoming of the future 
futurity grows out of me i do not create it and yet i do 
though not deliberately and willfully but rather against will 
and intention if i want to create the future then i work against 
my future and if i do not want to create it once again i do not 
take sufficient part in the creation of the future and everything 
happens then according to unavoidable laws to which i fall victim 
the ancients devised magic to compel fate they needed it to 
determine outer fate we need it to determine inner fate and 
to find the way that we are unable to conceive for a long time i 
 the mandrake is a plant whose roots bear some resemblance to the human figure hence they have been used in magical rites according to legend they shriek when 
they are pulled from the ground in the philosophical tree  jung noted that the magical mandrake when tied to the tail of a black dog shrieks when it is torn 
out of the earth cw  io 
 the drcift continues everything is forever the same and yet not for the wheel rolls along on a long road but the way leads through valleys and across mountains 
the movement of the wheel and the eternal recurrence of its parts is essential to the carriage but meaning lies in the way meaning is attained only through the wheels 
constant revolution and forward movement the recurrence of the past is inherent in forward movement this can only baffle the ignorant person ignorance makes 
us resist the necessary recurrence of the same or greed allows the wheel to toss us up and away in its upward movement because we believe that we will rise ever 
higher with this part of the wheel but we will not rise higher but deeper ultimately we will be at the very bottom thus praise standstill since it shows you that you 
are not bound to the spokes like ixion but sit alongside the charioteer who will interpret the meaning of the way to you pp  in greek mythology ixion 
was the son of ares he tried to seduce hera and zeus punished him by binding him to a fiery wheel that rolled unceasingly 
 the notion that everything recurs is found in various traditions such as stoicism and pythagoreanism and features prominently in nietzsches work there has 
been much debate in nietzsche studies as to whether it should primarily be understood as an ethical imperative oflife affirmation or as cosmological doctrine see 
karl lwith nietzsches doctrine of the eternal recurrence of the same tr j lomax berkeley university of california press i jung discusses this in i nietzsches

 i liber secundus  
considered what type of magic this would have to be and in the end 
i found nothing whoever cannot find it within himself should 
become an apprentice and so i took myself off to a far country 
where a great magician lived of whose reputation i had heard 
the magician 
cap xxi 
hi  i  after a long search i found the small house 
in the country fronted by a large bed of tulips this is where 
iiahmqn philemon the magician lives with his wife baykil 
baucis iiahmqn is one of those magicians who has not yet 
managed to banish old age but who lives it with dignity and his 
wife can only do the same their interests seem to have become 
narrow even childish they water their bed of tulips and tell each 
other about the flowers that have newly appeared and their 
days fade into a pale wavering chiaracuso lit up by the past only 
slightly frightened of the darkness of what is to come 
why is iiahmqn a magician does he conjure up 
immortality for himself a life beyond he was probably only 
a magician by profession and he now appears to be a pensioned 
magician who has retired from service his desirousness and 
creative drive have expired and he now enjoys his wellearned 
rest out of sheer incapacity like every old man who can do nothing 
else than plant tulips and water his little garden the magical 
rod lies in a cupboard together with the sixth and seventh books 
of moses and the wisdom of epmhl tpilmeriltyl hermes 
trismegitsus iiahmqn is old and has become somewhat 
feebleminded he still murmurs a few magical spells for the well
being of bewitched cattle in return for some petty cash or a gift 
for the kitchen but it is uncertain if these spells are still correct 
and whether he understands their meaning it is also clear that 
it hardly matters what he murmurs  as the cattle might also 
get well on their own there goes old iiahmqn in the garden 
bent with a watering can in his shaking hand baucis stands at 
the kitchen window and looks at him calmly and impassively she 
has already seen this image a thousand timessomewhat more 
infirm every time feebler seeing it a little less well every time 
since her eyesight gradually has become we aker  
 the handwritten draft has instead tenth adventure p  
 january   i stand at the garden gate they have not noticed the stranger 
iiahmqn old magician how are you i callout to him he 
does not hear me seeming to be stonedeaf i follow him and talce 
his arm he turns and greets me awkwardly and trembling he has 
a white beard and thin white hair and a wrinkled face and there 
appears to be something about this face his eyes are gray and old 
and something in them is strange one would like to say alive i 
am well stranger he says but what are you doing here 
i people tell me that you understand the black art i am 
interested in that will you tell me about it 
i what should i tell you about there is nothing to tell 
i dont be illnatured old man i want to learn 
i you are certainly more learned than i what could i 
teach you 
i do not be mean i certainly dont intend to become your 
competitor im just curious to know what you are up to and what 
magic you are performing 
i what do you want in the past i have helped people here 
and there who have been sick and disadvantaged 
i what exactly did you do 
i well i did it quite simply with sympathy 
i  old man that word sounds comical and ambiguous 
i how so 
i it could mean that you helped people either by expressing 
compassion or by superstitious sympathetic means 
i well surely it would have been both 
i and thats all there was to your magic 
i there was more 
i what was it tell me 
i that is none of your business you are impertinent 
and meddlesome 
i please dont take my curiosity badly recently i heard 
something about magic that awalcened my interest in this 
bygone practice and then i came to you because i heard that 
you understand the black art if magic were still taught today 
at university i would have studied it there but the last college of 
magic was closed long ago today no professor knows anything 
anymore about magic so do not be sensitive and miserly but 
tell me a bit about your art surely you dont want to take your 
secrets with you to the grave do you 
 in the metamorphoses ovid tells the tale of philemon and baucis jupiter and mercury wandered disguised as mortals in the hill country of phyrgia they searched for 
somewhere to rest but were barred by a thousand homes an old couple finally took them in the couple had been married in their cottage in their youth grew old 
together and contentedly accepted their poverty they prepared a meal for their guests during the meal the couple saw that the flagon automatically refilled itself as 
soon as it was emptied in honor of their guests the couple offered to kill their sole goose the goose took refuge with the gods who said that it should not be killed 
jupiter and mercury then revealed themselves and told the couple that their neighborhood would be punished but that they would be spared they asked the couple 
to climb the mountain with them when they reached the top the couple saw that the country surrounding their cottage had been flooded and only their cottage remained it 
had been transformed into a temple with marble columns and a gold roof the gods asked what the couple would like and philemon replied that they would like to 
be their priests and serve in their shrine and also that they could die at the same time their wish was granted and as they died they transformed into trees side 
by side in goethes faust  act v a wanderer who had previously been saved by them calls upon philemon and baucis faust was in the process of building a city 
on land reclaimed from the sea faust proceeds to tell mephistopheles that he wants philemon and baucis moved mephistopheles and three mighty men go and burn the 
cottage with philemon and baucis in it faust replies that he had only intended to exchange their dwelling to eckermann goethe recounted that my philemon and 
baucis  have nothing to do with that renowned ancient couple or the tradition connected with them i gave this couple the names merely to elevate the characters 
the persons and relations are similar and hence the use of the names has a good effect june   cited in goethe faust tr w arndt new york norton critical 
edition  p  on june   jung wrote a letter to alice raphael which refers to goethes comments to eckermann d philemon and baucis a typical 
goethean answer to eckermann trying to conceal his vestiges philemon ptarulx philema  kiss the loving one the simple old loving couple close to the earth and 
aware of the gods the complete opposite to the superman faust the product of the devil incidentally in my tower at bollingen is a hidden inscription philemon sacrum 
f austi poenitentia philemons sanctuary fausts repentance when i first encountered the archetype of the old wise man he called himself philemon  in alchemy ph 
and b represented the artifex or vir sapiens and the soror mystica zosimos theosebeia nicolas flamelperonelle mr south and his daughter in the xixth cent 
and the pair in the mutus tiber about  beinecke library yale university on jungs inscription see also his letter to hermann keyserling january  
letters i p  on january   jung wrote to paul schmitt i have taken over faust as my heritage and moreover as the advocate of philemon and baucis who 
unlike faust the superman are the hosts of the gods in a ruthless and godforsalen age letters i pp  
 in psychological types  in the course of a discussion of faust jung wrote the magician has preserved in himself a trace of primordial paganism he possesses 
a nature that is still unaffected by the christian splitting which means he has access to the unconscious which is still pagan where the opposites still lie in their 
original nmve state beyond all sinfulness but if assimilated into conscious life produce evil and good with the same primordial and consequently daimonic force  
therefore he is a destroyer as well as savior this figure is therefore preeminently suited to become the symbol carrier for an attempt at unification cw   
 the sixth and seventh books of moses ie in addition to the five contained in the torah were published in  by johann schiebel who claimed that they came 
from ancient talmudic sources the work is a compendium of kabbalistic magical spells which has been enduringly popular 
 the figure of hermes trismegistus was formed through the amalgamation of hermes with the egyptian god thoth the corpus hermeticum a collection of largely 
alchemical and magical texts dating from the early christian era but initially thought to have been much older was ascribed to him 
 in goethes faust philemon speaks of his declining powers older i could not lend a hand to the building of the dyke  as once i did full well  and with my powers 
ebbing  the waters were pushed back ll ii

  well all you will do is laugh anyway so why should i tell 
you anything it would be better if everything were buried with 
me it can always be rediscovered later it will never be lost to 
humanity since magic is reborn with each and every one of us 
 what do you mean do you believe that magic is really 
inborn in man 
 if i could i would say yes of course it is but you will find 
this laughable 
i no this time i will not laugh because i have often wondered 
about the fact that all peoples in all times and in all places have 
the same magical customs as you can see i have already thought 
along similar lines 
 what do you make of magic 
 to put it plainly nothing or very little it appears to me 
that magic is one of the vain tools of men inferior to nature i can 
detect no other tangible meaning in magic 
 your professors probably also know just as much 
 yes but what do you know about it 
 id prefer not to say 
i dont be so secretive old man otherwise i must assume 
that you know no more than i do 
 take it as you please 
i your answer suggests that you most definitely understand 
more about it than others 
 comical fellow how stubborn you are but what i like 
about you is that your reason does not deter you 
i thats actually the case whenever i want to learn and 
understand something i leave my socalled reason at home and 
give whatever it is that i am trying to understand the benefit of 
the doubt i have learned this gradually because nowadays the 
world of science is full of scary examples of the opposite 
 in which case you could do very well for yourself  
i i hope so now let us not stray from magic 
 why are you so determined about learning more about 
magic if you claim that you have left your reason at home or 
would you not consider consistency part of reason 
i i doi see or rather it seems as if you are quite an adept 
sophist who skillfully leads me around the house and back to 
the door 
 it seems that way to you because you judge everything from 
the standpoint of your intellect if you forsake reason for a while 
you will also give up consistency 
 thats a difficult test but if i want to be adept at some 
point i suppose i ought to submit to your request alright 
im listening 
 what do you want to hear 
 youre not going to draw me out im simply waiting for 
whatever you are going to say 
 and what if i say nothing 
 well then ill withdraw somewhat embarrassed and think 
that iahmnn is at the very least a shrewd fox who definitely 
would have something to teach me 
 with this my boy you have learned something about magic 
 ill have to chew on this i must admit that this is somewhat 
surprising i had imagined magic as being somewhat different 
 well this shows you how little you understand about 
magic and how incorrect your notion of it is 
 if this should be the case or thats how it is then i must 
confess that i approached the problem completely incorrectly i 
gather from what you are saying that these matters do not follow 
ordinary understanding the magician i  
 nor does magic 
 but you have not deterred me at all on the contrary 
im burning to hear even more what i know up to now is 
essentially negative 
 with this you have recognized a second main point 
above all you must know that magic is the negative of what 
one can know 
i that too my dear iahmqn is a piece of knowledge that 
is hard to digest and causes me no small pain the negative of 
what one can know i suppose you mean that it cannot be known 
dont you this exhausts my understanding 
 that is the third point that you must note as essential 
namely that there is nothing for you to understand 
 well i must confess that that is new and strange so 
nothing at all about magic can be understood 
 exactly magic happens to be precisely everything that 
eludes comprehension 
i but then how the devil is one to teach and learn magic 
 magic is neither to be taught nor learned its foolish that 
you want to learn magic 
 but then magic is nothing but deception 
 watch outyou have started reasoning again 
i its difficult to exist without reason 
 and that is exactly how difficult magic is 
i well in that case its hard work i conclude that it is an 
inescapable condition for the adept that he completely unlearns 
his reason 
 im afraid that is what it amounts to 
 ye gods this is serious 
 not as serious as you think reason declines with old 
age since it is an essential counterpart of the drives which are 
much more intense in youth than in old age have you ever seen 
young magicians 
i no the magician is proverbially old 
 you see im right 
 but then the prospects of the adept are bad he must wait 
until old age to experience the mysteries of magic 
 if he gives up his reason before then he can already 
experience something useful sooner 
 that seems to me to be a dangerous experiment one cannot 
give up reason without further ado 
 nor can one  simply become a magician 
i you lay damnable snares 
 what do you want such is magic 
i old devil you make me envious of unreasoning old age 
 well well a youth who wants to be an old man and 
why he wants to learn magic and yet dares not to for the sake 
of his youth 
 you spread a terrible net old trapper 
 perhaps you should still wait a few years with magic 
until your hair has gone gray and your reason has slackened 
somewhat 
 i dont want to listen to your scorn stupidly enough i got 
caught up in your yarn i cant make sense of you 
 but stupidity would perhaps be progress on the way 
to magic 
 incidentally what on earth do you intend to achieve with 
your magic 
 i am alive as you see 
 other old men are too 
 yes but have you seen how

ii i i liber secundus ii 
i well admittedly it was not a pleasant sight incidentally 
time has left its mark on you too 
p i know 
i so what gives you the advantage 
p it doesnt exactly meet the eye 
i what kind of advantage doesnt meet the eye 
p i call that magic 
i youre moving in a vicious circle may the devil get the 
better of you 
p well thats another advantage of magic not eve the devil 
gets the better of me youre beginning to understand magic so i 
must assume that you have a good aptitude for it 
i thank you piahmqn that is enough i feel dizzy goodbye 
i leave the small garden and walk down the street people are 
standing around in groups and glancing at me furtively i hear them 
whispering behind my back look there he goes old piahmqns 
student he spoke a long time with the old man he has learned 
something he knows the mysteries if only i could o what he is 
able to do now be quiet you damned fools i want to callout 
to them but i cannot since i do not know whether i have actually 
learned anything and because i remain silent they are even more 
convinced that i have received the black art from piahmqn 
  h i  i it is an error to believe that there are magical practices 
that one can learn one cannot understand magic one can only 
understand what accords with reason magic accords with 
unreason which one cannot understand the world accords not 
only with reason but also with unreason but just as one employs 
reason to make sense of the world in that what is reasonable 
about it approaches reason a lack of understanding also accords 
with unreason  
this meeting is magical and eludes comprehension magical 
understanding is what one calls noncomprehension everything that 
works magically is incomprehensible and the incomprehensible 
often works magically one calls incomprehensible workings 
magical the magical always surrounds me always involves me 
lt opens spaces that have no doors and leads out into the open 
where there is no exit the magical is good and evil and neither 
good nor evil magic is dangerous since what accords with unreason 
confuses allures and provokes and i am always its first victim 
where reason abides one needs no magic hence our time 
no longer needs magic only those without reason needed it 
to replace their lack of reason but it is thoroughly unreasonable 
to bring together what suits reason with magic since they have 
nothing to do with one another both become spoiled through 
being brought together therefore all those lacking reason quite 
rightly fall into superfluity and disregard a rational man of this 
time will therefore never use magic 
but it is another thing for whoever has opened the chaos 
in himself we need magic to be able to receive or invoke the 
messenger and the communication of the incomprehensible 
we recognized that the world comprises reason and unreason 
and we also understood that our way needs not only reason but 
also unreason this distinction is arbitrary and depends upon 
the level of comprehension but one can be certain that the greater part of the world eludes our understanding we must 
value the incomprehensible and unreasonable equally although 
they are not necessarily equal in themselves a part of the incom
prehensible however is only presently incomprehensible and 
might already concur with reason tomorrow but as long as one 
does not understand it it remains unreasonable insofar as the 
incomprehensible accords with reason one may try to think 
it with success but insofar as it is unreasonable  one needs 
magical practices to open it up 
the practice of magic consists in malting what is not understood 
understandable in an incomprehensible manner the magical 
way is not arbitrary since that would be understandable but 
it arises from incomprehensible grounds besides to speak of 
grounds is incorrect since grounds concur with reason nor can 
one speak of the groundless since hardly anything further can be 
said about this the magical way arises by itself if one opens up 
chaos magic also arises 
one can teach the way that leads to chaos but one cannot 
teach magic one can only remain silent about this which seems 
to be the best apprenticeship this view is confusing but this is 
what magic is like where reason establishes order and clarity 
magic causes disarray and a lack of clarity
 one indeed needs 
reason for the magical translation of the notunderstood into 
the understandable since only by means of reason can the 
understandable be created no one can say how to use reason 
but it does arise if one tries to express only what an opening of 
chaos means 
magic is a way of living if one has done ones best to steer the 
chariot and one then notices that a greater other is actually steer
ing it then magical operation takes place one cannot say what 
the effect of magic will be since no one can know it in advance 
because the magical is the lawless which occurs without rules 
and by chance so to spealc but the condition is that one totally 
accepts it and does not reject it in order to transfer everything 
to the growth of the tree stupidity too is part of this which 
everyone has a great deal of and also tastelessness which is possibly 
the greatest nuisance 
thus a certain solitude and isolation are inescapable conditions 
of life for the wellbeing of oneself and of the other otherwise one 
cannot  sufficiently be oneself a certain slowness of life which is 
like a standstill will be unavoidable the uncertainty of such a life 
will most probably be its greatest burden but still i must unite 
the two conflicting powers of my soul and keep them together 
in a true marriage until the end of my life since the magician is 
called piahmqn and his wife ba ykil i hold together what 
christ has kept apart in himself and through his example in 
others since the more the one half of my being strives toward the 
good the more the other half journeys to hell 
when the month of the twins had ended the men said to 
their shadows you are i since they had previously had their 
spirit around them as a second person thus the two became one 
and through this collision the formidable broke out precisely 
that spring of consciousness that one calls culture and which 
lasted until the time of christ but the fish indicated the 
moment when what was united split according to the eternal law 
 jungs marginal note to the calligraphic volume jan  this seems to refer to when this passage was transcribed into the calligraphic volume the writing at this 
point gets larger with more space between the words at this time cary baynes commenced her transcription 
 in psychological types  jung wrote reason can only give one equilibrium if ones reason is already an equilibrating organ  as a rule man needs the opposite of 
his actual condition to force him to find his place in the middle cw   
 the drqft continues magical practice hence falls into two parts first developing an understanding of chaos and second translating the essence into what can be 
understood p  
 the draft continues reason takes up only a very small share of magic this will offend you age and experience are needed the rash desirousness and fear of youth as 
well as its necessary virtuousness disturb the secret interplay of god and the devil you are then all too easily torn to one side or the other blinded or paralyzed p

of contrasts into an underworld and upperworld if the power 
of growth begins to cease then the united falls into its opposites 
christ sent what is beneath to hell since it strives toward the 
good that had to be but the separated cannot remain separated 
forever it will be united again and the month of the fish will soon 
be over we suspect and understand that growth needs both 
and hence we keep good and evil close together because we know 
that too far into the good means the same as too far into evil we 
keep them both together 
but we thus lose direction and things no longer flow from the 
mountain to the valley but grow quietly from the valley to the 
mountain that which we can no longer prevent or hide is our 
fruit the flowing stream becomes a lake and an ocean  that has 
no outlet unless its water rises to the sky as steam and falls from 
the clouds as rain while the sea is a death it is also the place of 
rising such is cpiahmqn who tends his garden our hands have 
been tied and each must sit quietly in his place he rises invisibly 
and falls as rain on distant lands the water on the ground is no 
cloud which should rain only pregnant women can give birth 
not those who have yet to conceive 
hi  but what mystery are you intimating to me with your 
name oh cpiahmqn truly you are the lover who once took in 
the gods as they wandered the earth when everyone else refused 
them lodging you are the one who unsuspectingly gave hospitality 
to the gods they thanked you by transforming your house into 
a golden temple while the flood swallowed everyone else you 
remained alive when chaos erupted you it was who served in the 
sanctuary when the peoples called out in vain to the gods truly 
it is the lover who survives why did we not see that and just 
when did the gods manifest precisely when ba yki wished to 
serve the esteemed guests her only goose that blessed stupidity 
the animal fled to the gods who then revealed themselves to their 
poor hosts who had given their last thus i saw that the lover 
survives and that he is the one who unwittingly grants hospitality 
to the gods 
truly oh cpiahmnn i did not see that your hut is a temple 
and that you cpiahmnn and ba yki serve in the sanctuary  
this magical power allows itself to be neither taught nor learned 
either one has it or does not have it now i know your final mystery 
you are a lover you have succeeded in uniting what has been 
sundered that is binding together the above and below have we 
not known this for a long time yes we knew it no we did not 
know it it has always been this way and yet it has never been 
thus why did i have to wander such long roads before i came 
to cpiahmqn if he was going to teach me what has been common 
knowledge for ages alas we have known everything since time the magician i  
immemorial and yet we will never know it until it is has been 
accomplished who exhausts the mystery of love 
hi  under which mask oh cpiahmqn are you hiding you 
did not strike me as a lover but my eyes were opened and i saw 
that you are a lover of your soul who anxiously and jealously 
guards its treasure there are those who love men and those who 
love the souls of men and those who love their own soul such a 
one is cpiahmqn the host of the gods 
you lie in the sun oh cpiahmqn like a serpent that coils around 
itself your wisdom is the wisdom of serpents cold with a grain 
of poison yet healing in small doses your magic paralyzes and 
therefore makes strong people who tear themselves away from 
themselves but do they love you are they thankful lover of 
your own soul or do they curse you for your magical serpent 
poison they keep their distance shaking their heads and 
whispering together 
are you still a man cpiahmqn or  is one not a man until 
one is a lover of ones own soul you are hospitable cpiahmqn 
you took the dirty wanderers unsuspectingly into your hut 
your house then became a golden temple and did i really leave 
your table unsatisfied what did you give me did you invite 
me for a meal you shimmered multicolored and inextricable 
nowhere did you give yourself to me as prey you escaped my 
grasp i found you nowhere are you still a man your kind is 
far more serpentlike 
i sought to grab hold of you and tear it out of you since the 
christians have learned to devour their god and how long will 
it take for what happens to the god also to happen to man i look 
into the vast land and hear nothing but wailing and see nothing 
but men consuming each other 
oh cpiahmnn you are no christian you did not let yourself 
be engorged and did not engorge me because of this you have 
neither lecture halls nor columned halls teeming with students 
who stand around and speak of the master and soak up his words 
like the elixir of life you are no christian and no pagan but a 
hospitable inhospitable one a host of the gods a survivor an 
eternal one the father of all eternal wisdom 
but did i really leave you unsatisfied no i left you because 
i was really satisfied yet what did i eat your words gave me 
nothing your words left me to myself and my doubt and so 
i ate myself and because of this oh cpiahmqn you are no 
christian since you nourish yourself from yourself and force 
men to do the same this displeases them most since nothing 
disgusts the human animal more than itself because of this 
they would rather eat all crawling hopping swimming and 
flying creatures yes even their own species before they nibble 
at themselves but this nourishment is effective and one is soon 
 the reference is to the astrological conception of the platonic month or aeon of pisces which is based on the precession of the equinoxes each platonic month 
consists of one zodiacal sign and lasts approximately  years jung discusses the symbolism attached to this in aion  cw  ch  he notes that around  
bc there was a conjunction of saturn and jupiter representing a union of extreme opposites which would place the birth of christ under pisces pisces latin for 
fishes is known as the sign of the fish and is often represented by two fish swimming in opposite directions on the platonic months see alice howelljungian 
synchronicity in astrological signs and ages wheaton ii est books  p  jung started studying astrology in ii in the course of his study of mythology and 
learned to cast horoscopes jung to freud may  ii the freudjung letters p  in terms of jungs sources for the history of astrology he cited auguste bouche
leclercqs lastrologie grecque on nine occasions in his later work paris ernest leroux  
 this refers to the end of the platonic month of pisces and the beginning of the platonic month of aquarius the precise dating of this is uncertain in aion  
jung noted astrologically the beginning of the next aeon according to the starting point you select falls between ad  and  cw   note  
 in aion  jung wrote  as seems probable the aeon of the fishes is ruled by the archetypal motif of the hostile brothers then the approach of the next platonic 
month namely aquarius will constellate the problem of the union of opposites it will then no longer be possible to write off evil as a mere privatio boni its real 
existence will have to be recognized cw   
 the draft continues the hibernal rains began with christ he taught mankind the way to heaven we teach the way to earth hence nothing has been removed 
from the gospel but only added to it p 
 the draft continues our striving focused on sagacity and intellectual superiority and we hence developed all our cleverness but the extraordinary extent of stupidity 
inherent in all men was disregarded and denied but if we accept the other in us we also evoke the particular stupidity of our nature stupidity is one of mans strange 
hobbyhorses there is something divine about it and yet something of the megalomania of the world which is why stupidity is really large it keeps away everything 
that could induce us to intelligence it leaves everything not understood which is not naturally supposed to demand understanding this particular stupidity occurs 
in thought and in life somewhat deaf somewhat blind it brings about necessary fate and keeps from us the virtuous ness coupled with rationality it is what separates 
and isolates the mixed seeds of life affording us thus with a clear view of good and evil and of what is reasonable and what not but many people are logical in their 
lack of reason p 
 in this paragraph jung refers to the classical account of philemon and baucis from the metamorphoses

satiated from it because of this oh iiahmqn we rise satiated 
from your table 
your way oh iiahmqn is instructive you leave me in a 
salutary darkness where there is nothing for me to either see 
or look for you are no light that shines in the darkness no 
savior who establishes an eternal truth and thus extinguishes the 
 nocturnal light of human understanding you leave room for 
the stupidity and jokes of others you do not want oh blessed 
one anything from the other but instead you tend the flowers 
in your own garden he who needs you asks you and oh clever 
iiahmnn i suppose that you also ask those from whom you 
need something and that you pay for what you receive christ 
has made men desirous for ever since they expect gifts from 
their saviors without any service in return giving is as childish 
as power he who gives presumes himself powerful the virtue 
of giving is the skyblue mantle of the tyrant you are wise oh 
iiahmqn you do not give you want your garden to bloom 
and for everything to grow from withn itself 
i praise oh iiahmnn your lack of acting like a savior you are 
no shepherd who runs after stray sheep since you believe in the 
dignity of man who is not necessarily a sheep but ifhe happens to 
be a sheep you would leave him the rights and dignity of sheep 
since why should sheep be made into men there are still more 
than enough men 
you know oh iiahmqn the wisdom of things to come 
therefore you are old oh so very ancient and just as you tower 
above me in years so you tower above the present in futurity and 
the length of your past is immeasurable you are legendary and 
unreachable you were and will be returning periodically your 
wisdom is invisible your truth is unknowable entirely untrue in 
any given age and yet true in all eternity but you pour out living 
water from which the flowers of your garden bloom a starry 
water a dew of the night 
what do you need oh iiahmqn you need men for the sake 
of small things since everything greater and the greatest thing is 
in you christ spoiled men since he taught them that they can be 
saved only by one namely him the soil of god and ever since 
men have been demanding the greater things from others 
especially their salvation and if a sheep gets lost  somewhere 
it accuses the shepherd oh iiahmqn you are a man and you 
prove that men are not sheep since you look after the greatest 
in yourself and hence fructifying water flows into your garden 
from inexhaustible jugs 
hi  are you lonelyj oh iiahmqn i see no entourage and no 
companions around you ba ykii is only your other half you 
live with flowers trees and birds but not with men should you 
not live with men are you still a man do you want nothing 
from men do you not see how they stand together and concoct 
rumors and childish fairy tales about you do you not want to go 
to them and say that you are a man and a mortal as they are and 
that you want to love them oh iiahmqn you laugh i understand 
you just now i ran into your garden and wanted to tear out of 
you what i had to understand from within myself 
oh iiahmqn i understand immediately i made you into a 
savior who lets himselfbe consumed and bound with gifts thats 
what men are like you think they are all still christians but they 
want even more they want you as you are otherwise you would 
not be iiahmnn to them and they would be inconsolable if they could find no bearer for their legends hence they would also 
laugh if you approached them and said you were as mortal as 
they are and want to love them if you did that you would not be 
iiahmqn they want you iiahmqn but not another mortal 
who suffers from the same ills as they do 
i understand you oh iiahmqn you are a true  lover since 
you love your soul for the sake of men because they need a king 
who lives from himself and owes no one gratitude for his life 
they want to have you thus you fulfill the wish of the people and 
you vanish you are a vessel of fables you would besmirch yourself 
if you went to men as a man since they would all laugh and call 
you a liar and a swindler since iiahmnn is not a man 
i saw oh iiahmqn that crease in your face you were young 
once and wanted to be a man among men but the christian 
animals did not love your pagan humanity since they felt in you 
what they needed they always sought the branded one and 
when they caught him somewhere in freedom they locked him 
in a golden cage and took from him the force of his masculinity 
so that he was paralyzed and sat in silence then they praise him 
and devise fables about him i know they call this veneration 
and if they do not find the true one they at least have a pope 
whose occupation it is to represent the divine comedy but the 
true one always disowns himsel since he knows nothing higher 
than to be a man 
are you laughing oh iiahmqn i understand you it irked 
you to be a man like others and because you truly loved being 
human you voluntarily locked it away so that you could be for men 
at least what they wanted to have from you therefore i see you 
oh iiahmqn not with men but wholly with flowers the trees 
and the birds and all waters flowing and still that do not besmirch 
your humanity for you are not iiahmqn to the flowers trees and 
birds but a man yet what solitude what inhumanity  
hi  why are you laughingj ohiiahmnnj i cannotfathomyou but 
do i not see the blue air of your gardenr what happy shades surround your 
does the sun hatch blue midday specters around your 
are you laughing oh iiahmqn alas i understand you 
humanity has completely faded for you but its shadow has arisen 
for you how much greater and happier the shadow of humanity 
is than it is itself the blue midday shadows of the dead alas there 
is your humanity oh iiahmnn you are a teacher and friend of 
the dead they stand sighing in the shade of your house they live 
under the branches of your trees they drink the dew of your tears 
they warm themselves at the goodness of your heart they hunger 
after the words of your wisdom which sounds full to them full 
of the sounds of life i sawyou oh iiahmnn at the noonday hour 
when the sun stood highest you stood spealcing with a blue shade 
blood stuck to its forehead and solemn torment darkened it i can 
guess oh iiahmnn who your midday guest was how blind i 
was fool that i am that is you oh iiahmqn but who am i i go 
my way shaking my head and peoples looks follow me and i remain 
silent oh despairing silence  hi  
o h master of the garden i see your dark tree from afar in the shimmering 
sun my street leads to the valleys where men live i am a wandering beggar 
and i remain silent 
killing off wouldbe prophets is a gain for the people if 
they want murder then may they kill their false prophets if the

ii mouth of the gods remains silent then each can listen to his 
own speech he who loves the people remains silent if only false 
teachers teach the people will kill the false teachers and will fall 
into the truth even on the way of their sins only after the 
darkest night will it be day so cover the lights and remain silent 
so that the night will become dark and noiseless the sun rises

i continue on my way accompanied by a finely polished piece 
of steel hardened in ten fires stowed safely in my robe secretly 
i wear chain mail under my coat overnight i became fond of 
serpents and i solved their riddle i sit down next to them on 
the hot stones lying by the wayside i know how to catch them 
cunningly and cruelly those cold devils that prick the heel of the 
unsuspecting i became their friend and played a softly toned 
flute but i decorate my cave with their dazzling skins as i 
walked on my way i came to a red rock on which a great irides
cent serpent lay since i had now learned magic from liahmon 
i took out my flute again and played a sweet magical song to 
make her believe that she was my soul when she was sufficiently 
enchanted  image i  i i spoke to her my sister 
my soul what do you say but she spoke flattered and therefore 
tolerantly i let grass grow over everything that you do 
i that sounds comforting and seems not to say much 
s would you like me to say much i can also be banal as 
you know and let myself be satisfied that way 
i that seems hard to me i believe that you stand in a close 
connection with everything beyond  with what is greatest 
and most uncommon therefore i thought that banality would 
be foreign to you 
s banality is my element 
i that would be less astonishing if i said it about myself 
s the more uncommon you are the more common i can be 
a true respite for me i think you can sense that i dont need to 
torment myself today the magician i i 
i i can feel it and im worried that your tree will ultimately 
bear me no more fruit 
s worried already dont be stupid and let me rest 
i i notice that you like being banal but i do not take you to 
heart my dear friend since i now know you much better than 
before 
s youre getting to be familiar im afraid that you are 
beginning to lose respect 
i are you upset i believe that would be uncalled for 
im sufficiently wellinformed about the proximity of pathos 
and banality 
s so have you noticed that the becoming of the soul follows 
a serpentine path have you seen how soon day becomes night 
and night day how water and dry land change places and 
that everything spasmodic is merely destructive 
i i believe that i sawall this i want to lie in the sun on this 
warm stone for a while perhaps the sun will incubate me 
but the serpent crept up to me quietly and wound herself 
smoothly around my feet evening fell and night came i spoke 
to the serpent and said i dont know what to say all pots are 
on the boil 
s a meal is being prepared 
i a last supper i suppose 
s a union with all humanity 
i a horrifying sweet thought to be both guest and dish at 
this meal 
s that was also christs highest pleasure 
i how holy how sinful how everything hot and cold flows 
into one another madness and reason want to be married 
the lamb and the wolf graze peacefully side by side it is all yes 
and no the opposites embrace each other see eye to eye and 
intermingle they recognize their oneness in agonizing pleasure 
my heart is filled with wild battle the waves of dark and bright 
rivers rush together one crashing over the other i have never 
experienced this before 
s that is new my dear one at least for you 
i i suppose you are mocking me but tears and laughter are 
one  i no longer feel like either and i am rigid with tension 
loving reaches up to heaven and resisting reaches just as high 
 jungs marginal note to the calligraphic volume the bhagavadgita says whenever there is a decline of the law and an increase in iniquity then i put forth myself for 
the rescue of the pious and for the destruction of the evildoers for the establishment of the law i am born in every age the citation is from chapter  verses  of 
the bhagavad gita krishna is instructing arjuna concerning the nature of truth 
 the text in the image reads father of the prophet beloved philemon jung subsequently painted another version of this painting as a mural in one of the bedrooms in 
his tower at bollingen he added an inscription in latin from the rosarium philosophorum in which hermes describes the stone as saying defend me and i will defend 
thee give me my right that i may help thee for sol is mine and the beams thereof are my inward parts but luna is proper to me and my light excelleth all light and 
my goods are higher than all goods i give many riches and delights to men desiring them and when i seek after anything they acknowledge it i make them understand 
and i cause them to possess divine strength i engender light but my nature is darkness unless my metal should be dry all bodies have need of me because i moisten 
them i blot out their rustiness and extract their substance therefore i and my son being joined together there can be nothing made better nor more honorable in 
the whole world jung cited some of these lines in psychology and alchemy  cw     the rosarium first published in  was one of the most 
important texts of european alchemy and concerns the means of producing the philosophers stone it contained a series of woodcuts of symbolic figures which was 
jungs exemplar in psychology of the transference explained through an alchemical series of pictures for doctors and practical psychologists  cw  
 in the psychological aspects of the kore  jung anonymously described this image as xlthen she the anima appears in a church taking the place of the 
altar still overlifesize but with veiled face he commented dream xi restores the anima to the christian church not as an icon but as the altar itself the altar is the 
place of sacrifice and also the receptacle for consecrated relics cw  i   on the lefthand side there is the arabic word for daughters on the border 
of the image is the following inscription dei sapientia in mysterio quae abscondita est quam praedestinavit ante secula in gloriam nostrum quam nemo principium 
huius secuti cognovit spiritus enim omnia scrutatur etiam profundo dei this is a citation from i corinthians  jung has omitted deus before ante secula the 
portions cited are marked here in italics but we speak the wisdom of god in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which god ordained bifore the world unto our glory which none of 
the princes of the world lmew for had they known it they would not have crucified the lord of glory but as it is written eye hath not seen nor ear heard neither 
have entered into the heart of man the things which god hath prepared for them that love him but god hath revealed them unto us by his spiritfor the spirit searcheth 
all things yea the deep things of god on either side of the arch is the following inscription spiritus et sponsa dicunt veni et qui audit dicat veni et qui sitit veniat qui 
vult accipiat aquam vitae gratis the text is from revelation  the spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth say come and let him that is athirst 
come and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely above the arch is the following inscription ave virgo virginum this is the title of a medieval hymn 
 january   
 from this point in the calligraphic volume jungs coloring of red and blue initials becomes less consistent some have been added here for consistency 
 this line is not in black book  where the voice is not identified as the serpent 
 january   
 in mysterium coniunctionis  jung noted if the projected conflict is to be healed it must return into the soul of the individual where it had its beginnings 
in an unconscious manner he who wants to be the master of this descent must celebrate a last supper with himself and eat his own flesh and drink his own blood 
which means that he must recognize and accept the other in himself cw  i 
 cf isaiah ii the wolf also shall dwell with the lamb and the leopard shall lie down with the kid and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together and a 
little child shall lead them 
 jungs marginal note to the calligraphic volume xiv aug  this appears to refer to when this passage was transcribed into the calligraphic volume in the autumn 
of  jung went to africa together with peter baynes and george beckwith they left england on october  and he arrived back in zurich on march   ii

  i liber secundus  
they are entwined and will not let go of each other since the 
excessive tension seems to indicate the ultimate and highest 
possibility of feeling 
s you express yourself emotionally and philosophically you 
know that one can say all this much more simply for example 
one can say that you hav fallen in love all the way from the 
worm up to tristan and isolde 
i yes i know but nonetheless 
s religion is still tormenting you it seems how many 
shields do you still need much better to say it straight out 
i youre not tripping me up 
s well what is it with morality have morality and immorality 
also become one today 
i youre mocking me my sister and chthonic devil but i 
must say that those two thatrose up to heaven entwined are also 
good and evil im not joking but i groan because joy and pain 
sound shrill together 
s where then is your understanding youve gone utterly 
stupid after all you could resolve everything by thinking 
 my understanding my thinking i no longer have any 
understanding it has grown impervious to me 
s you deny everything that you believed youve completely 
forgotten who you are you even deny faust who walked calmly 
past all the specters 
i im no longer up to this my spirit too is a specter 
s ah i see you follow my teaching 
i unfortunately thats the case and it has benefited me with 
painful joy 
s you turn your pain into pleasure you are twisted blinded 
just suffer you fool 
i this misfortune ought to make me happy 
the serpent now became angry and tried to bite my heart but my 
secret armorbroke her poisonous fang she drew back astonished 
and said hissing you actually behave as if you were unfathomable 
i thats because i have studied the art of stepping from the 
left foot onto the right and vice versa which others have done 
unthinkingly from time immemorial 
the serpent raised herself again as if accidentally  holding 
her tail in front of her mouth so that i should not see the broken 
fang proudly and calmly she said so you have finally noticed this but i spoke to her smilingly the sinuous line of life could 
not escape me in the long run 
 hi  where is truth and faith where is warm trust 
you find all this between men but not between men and serpents 
even if they are serpent souls but wherever there is love the 
serpentlike abides also christ himself compared himself to a 
serpent and his hellish brother the antichrist is the old 
dragon himself  what is beyond the human that appears in 
love has the nature of the serpent and the bird and the serpent 
often enchants the bird and more rarely the bird bears off the 
serpent man stands inbetween what seems like a bird to you 
is a serpent to the other and what seems like a serpent to you 
is a bird to the other therefore you will meet the other only in 
human form if you want to become then a battle between bird 
and serpent breaks out and if you only want to be you will be a 
man to yourself and to others he who is becoming belongs in the 
desert or in a prison for he is beyond the human if men want to 
become they behave like animals no one saves us from the evil 
of becoming unless we choose to go through hell 
why did i behave as if that serpent were my soul only it 
seems because my soul was a serpent this knowledge gave my 
soul a new face and i decided henceforth to enchant her myself 
and subject her to my power serpents are wise and i wanted my 
serpent soul to communicate her wisdom to me never before 
had life been so doubtful a night of aimless tension being one 
in being directed against one another nothing moved neither 
god nor the devil so i approached the serpent that lay in the 
sun as if she were unthinking her eyes were not visible since 
they blinked in the shimmering sunshine and  image   
 i i spoke to her how will it be now that god and the 
devil have become one are they in agreement to bring life to a 
standstill does the conflict of opposites belong to the inescapable 
conditions of life and does he who recognizes and lives the unity 
of opposites stand still he has completely taken the side of actual 
life and he no longer acts as if he belonged to one party and had 
to battle against the other but he is both and has brought their 
discord to an end through taking this burden from life has 
he also taken the force from it 
the serpent turned and spoke illhumoredly truly you pester 
me opposites were certainly an element of life for me you

 image legend  january i my friend hermann sigg died age  jung described this as a luminous flower in the center with stars rotating about it around the 
flower walls with eight gates the whole conceived as a transparent window this mandala was based on a dream noted on january  i see above p i from 
the town map the relation between the dream and the painting is clear see appendix a he anonymously reproduced this in i in commentary to the secret 
of the golden flower  from which this description is taken he reproduced it again in i and added the following commentary the rose in the center is depicted 
as a ruby its outer ring being conceived as a wheel or a wall with gates so that nothing can come out from inside or go in from outside the mandala was a spontane
ous product from the analysis of a male patient mter narrating the dream jung added the dreamer went on i tried to paint this dream but as so often happens 
it came out rather different the magnolia turned into a sort of rose made of rubycolored glass it shone like a fourrayed star the square represents the wall of the 
park and at the same time a street leading rpund the park in a square from it there radiate eight main streets and from each of these eight sidestreets which meet in 
a shining red central point rather like the etoile in paris the acquaintance mentioned in the dream lived in a house at the corner of one of these stars the mandala 
thus combines the classic motifs of flower star circle precinct temenos and plan of city divided into quarters with citadel the whole thing seemed like a window 
opening on to eternity wrote the dreamer concerning mandala symbolism cw  i  in i he used this same expression to denote the illustration of 
the self mysterium coniunctionis cw i on october  i jung showed this mandala in a seminar and commented on it the next day in this account he states 
that the painting of the mandala preceded the dream you remember possibly the picture that i showed you last evening the central stone and the little jewels round 
it it is perhaps interesting if i tell you about the dream in connection with it i was the perpetrator of that mandala at a time when i had not the slightest idea what 
a mandala was and in my extreme modesty i thought i am the jewel in the center and those little lights are surely very nice peosple who believe that they are also jewels 
but smaller ones  i thought very well of myself that i was able to express myself like that my marvelous center here and i am right in my heart he added that at 
first he did not recognize that the park was the same as the mandala which he had painted and commented now liverpool is the center of lifeliver is the center of 
lifeand i am not the center i am the fool who lives in a dark place somewhere i am one of those little side lights in that way my western prejudice that i was the 
center of the mandala was correctedthat i am everything the whole show the king the god the psychology ofkundalini yoga p ioo in memories jung added some

 probably will have noticed this your innovations deprive me 
of this source of power i can neither lure you with pathos nor 
annoy you with banality i am somewhat baffled 
 if you are baffled should i give counsel i would rather 
you dive down to the deeper grounds to which you have entry 
and ask hades or the heavenly ones perhaps someone there can 
give counsel 
s you have become imperious 
i necessity is even more imperious than  i must live and be 
able to move 
s you have the whole wide earth what do you want to ask 
the beyond for 
 it isnt curiosity that drives me but necessity i will not yield 
s i obey but reluctantly this style is new and unaccustomed 
tome 
 im sorry but there is pressing need tell the depths that 
prospects are not looking too good for us because we have cut 
off an important organ from life as you know im not the guilty 
one since you have led me carefully along this way 
s you might have rejected the apple 
 enough of these jokes you know that story better than i 
do i am serious we need some air be on your way and fetch the 
fire it has already been dark around me for too long are you 
sluggish or cowardly 
s im off to work take from me what i bring up 
hi  slowly the throne of the god ascends into empty 
space followed by the holy trinity all of heaven and finally 
satan himself he resists and clings to his beyond he will not  
let it go the upperworld is too chilly for him 
s have you got tight hold ofhim 
 welcome hot thing of darkness my soul probably pulled 
you up roughly 
swhy this noise i protest against this violent extraction 
i calm down i didnt expect you you come last of all you 
seem to be the hardest part 
s what do you want from me i dont need you 
impertinent fellow 
 its a good thing we have you youre the liveliest thing in 
the whole dogma 
s what concern is your prattle to me make it quick 
im freezing 
 listen something has just happened to us we have united the 
opposites among other things we have bonded you with god 
s for gods sake why this hopeless fuss why such nonsense 
 please that wasnt so stupid this unification is an 
important principle we have put a stop to neverending 
quarreling to finally free our hands for real life 
s this smells of monism i have already made note of some 
of these men special chambers have been heated for them 
i youre mistaken matters are not as rational with us as they 
 black book  you are playing adam and eve with me p  
 jungs marginal note to the calligraphic volume visio the magician i  
seem to be we have no single correct truth either rather a most 
remarkable and strange fact has occurred after the opposites had 
been united quite unexpectedly and incomprehensibly nothing 
further happened everything remained in place peacefully and yet 
completely motionless and life turned into a complte standstill 
s yes you fools you certainly have made a pretty mess 
of things 
i well your mockery is unnecessary our intentions 
were serious 
s your seriousness leads us to suffer the ordering of the 
beyond is shaken to its foundations 
 so you realize that matters are serious i want an answer 
to my question what should happen under these circumstances 
we no longer know what to do 
s well it is hard to know what to do and difficult to give 
advice even if one would like to give it you are blinded fools a 
brashly impertinent people why didnt you stay out of trouble 
how do you mean to understand the ordering of the world 
 your ranting suggests that you are quite thoroughly 
aggrieved look the holy trinity is taking things coolly it seems 
not to dislike the innovation  
s ah the trinity is so irrational that one  can never trust 
its reactions i strongly advise you not to talce those symbols 
seriously  
 i thank you for this wellmeant advice but you seem to be 
interested one would expect you to pass unbiased judgment on 
account of your proverbial intelligence 
s me unbiased you can judge for yourself if you consider 
this absoluteness in its completely lifeless equanimity you can 
easily discover that the state and standstill produced by your 
presumptuousness closely resembles the absolute but if i counsel 
you i place myself completely on your side since you too find 
this standstill unbearable 
 what you take my side that is strange 
s thats not so strange the absolute was always adverse to 
the living i am still the real master of life 
 that is suspicious your reaction is far too personal 
s my reaction is far from personal i am utterly restless 
quickly hurrying life i am never contented never unperturbed 
i pull everything down and hastily rebuild i am ambition greed 
for fame lust for action i am the fizz of new thoughts and action 
the absolute is boring and vegetative 
i alright i believe you sojust what do you advise 
s the best advice i can give you is revoke your completely 
harmful innovation as soon as possible 
i what would be gained by that wed have to start from 
scratch again and would infallibly reach the same conclusion a 
second time what one has grasped once one cannot intentionally 
not know again and undo your counsel is no counsel 
s but could you exist without divisiveness and disunity you 
have to get worked up about something represent a party overcome 
opposites if you want to live

yearold text of the golden castle the embryo of the immortal body ecclesia catholic et protestantes et seclusi in secreto aeon finitus a church both catholic and 
protestant shrouded in secrecy the end of an aeon jung described this as a mandala as a fortified city with wall and moat within a broad moat surrounding a wall 
fortified with sixteen towers and with another inner moat this moat encloses a central castle with golden roofs whose centre is a golden temple he anonymously 
reproduced this in  in commentary on the secret of the golden flower  from which this description is taken he reproduced it again in  in concerning 
mandala symbolism and added the following commentary painting of a medieval city with walls and moats streets and churches arranged quadratically the inner 
city is again surrounded by walls and moats like the imperial city in peking the buildings all open inward toward the center represented by a castle with a golden 
roof it too is surrounded by a moat the ground round the castle is laid with black and white tiles representing the united opposites this mandala was done by a 
middleaged man  a picture like this is unknown in christian symbolism the heavenly jerusalem of revelation is known to everybody coming to the indian

the square foot house life can be regulated the square foot house is the face the square inch field in the face what could that be other than the heavenly heart

the mysterious creative powers the gnomes who work under the earth ie below the threshold of consciousness in order to supply us with lucky ideas as imps and 
hobgoblins however they also lay all sorts of nasty tricks keeping back names and dates that were on the tip of the tongue making us say the wrong thing etc they 
give an eye to everything that has not already been anticipated by consciousness and the functions at its disposal  deeper insight will show that the primitive and 
archaic qualities of the inferior function conceal all sorts of significant relationships and symbolic meanings and instead oflaughing off the cabiri as ridiculous tom

 carry up what slumbers in the earthly what is dead and yet enters 
into the living we do this slowly and easily what you do in vain 
in your human way we complete what is impossible for you 
i what should i leave to you which troubles can i transfer 
to you what should i not do and what do you do better 
the cabiri you forget the lethargy of matter you want to 
pull up with your own force what can only rise slowly ingesting 
itself affixed to itself from within spare yourself the trouble or 
you will disturb our work 
 should i trust you you untrustworthy ones you slaves and 
slave souls get to work let it be so 
ihi  it seems to me that i gave you a long time neither 
did i descend to you nor did i disturb your work i lived in the 
light of day and did the work of the day what did you do 
the cabiri we hauled things up we built we placed stone 
upon stone now you stand on solid ground 
 i feel the ground more solid i stretch upward 
the cabiri we forged a flashing  sword for you with which 
you can cut the knot that entangles you 
 i take the sword firmly in my hand i lift it for the blow 
the cabiri we also place before you the devilish skillfully 
twined knot that locks and seals you strike only sharpness will 
cut through it 
 let me see it the great knot all wound round truly a 
masterpiece of inscrutable nature a wily natural tangle of roots 
grown through one another only mother nature the blind 
weaver could work such a tangle a great snarled ball and a 
thousand small knots all artfully tied intertwined truly a human 
brain am i seeing straight what did you do you set my brain 
before me did you give me a sword so that its flashing sharpness 
slices through my brain what were you thinking of 
the cabiri the womb of nature wove the brain the womb 
of the earth gave the iron so the mother gave you both 
entanglement and severing 
 mysterious do you really want to make me the executioner 
of my own brain 
the cabiri it befits you as the master of the lower nature 
man is entangled in his brain and the sword is also given to him 
to cut through the entanglement 
i what is the entanglement you speak of 
the cabiri the entanglement is your madness the sword is 
the overcoming of madness 
i you offsprings of the devil who told you that i am mad 
you earth spirits you roots of clay and excrement are you not 
yourselves the root fibers of my brain you polypsnared rubbish 
channels for juice knotted together parasites upon parasites all 
sucked up and deceived secretly climbing up over one another 
by night you deserve the flashing sharpness of my sword you 
want to persuade me to cut through you are you contemplating 
selfdestruction how come nature gives birth to creatures that 
she herself wants to destroy 
the cabiri do not hesitate we need destruction since we 
ourselves are the entanglement he who wishes to conquer new the mag i clan i  
land  brings down the bridges behind him let us not exist 
anymore we are the thousand canals in which everything also 
flows back again into its origin 
 should i sever my own roots kill my own people whose 
king i am should i make my own tree wither you really are 
the sons of the devil 
the cabiri strike we are servants who want to die for 
their master 
i what will happen if i strike 
the cabiri then you will no longer be your brain but will 
exist beyond your madness do you not see your madness is 
your brain the terrible entanglement and intertwining in the 
connection of the roots in the nets of canals the confusion of 
fibers being engrossed in the brain makes you wild strike he 
who finds the way rises up over his brain you are a tom thumb 
in the brain beyond the brain you gain the form of a giant we 
are surely sons of the devil but did you not forge us out of the 
hot and dark so we have something of its nature and of yours 
the devil says that everything that exists is also worthy since 
it perishes as sons of the devil we want destruction but as your 
creatures we want our own destruction we want to rise up in 
you through death we are roots that suck up from all sides 
now you have everything that you need therefore chop us up 
tear us out 
 will i miss you as servants as a master i need slaves 
the cabiri the master serves himself 
 you ambiguous sons of the devil these words are 
your undoing may my sword strike you this blow shall be 
valid forever 
the cabiri woe woe what we feared what we desired has 
come to pass 
 image   hi  i set foot on new land nothing 
brought up should flow back no one shall tear down what i 
have built my tower is of iron and has no seams the devil is 
forged into the foundations the cabiri built it and the master 
builders were sacrificed with the sword on the battlements of the 
tower just as a tower surmounts the summit of a mountain on 
which it stands so i stand above my brain from which i grew 
i have become hard and cannot be undone again no more do i 
flow back i am the master of my own self i admire my mastery 
i am strong and beautiful and rich the vast lands and the blue 
sky have laid themselves before me and bowed to my mastery i 
wait upon no one and no one waits upon me i serve myself and 
i myself serve therefore i have what i need 
my tower grew for several thousand years imperishable it does 
not sinlc back but it can be built over and will be built over few 
grasp my tower since it stands on a high mountain but many will 
see it  and not grasp it therefore my tower will remain unused 
no one scales its smooth walls no one lands on its pointed roof 
only he who finds the entrance hidden in the mountain and rises 
up through the labyrinths of the innards can reach the tower and 
the happiness of he who surveys things from there and he who 
lives from himself this has been attained and created it has not 
ii jungs marginal note to the calligraphic volume thereupon i laid this matter aside for three weeks 
 in transformation symbolism in the mass  jung noted that the motif of the sword played an important role in alchemy and discussed its significance as an 
instrument of sacrifice its divisive and separative functions he noted that the alchemical sword brings about the solutio or separatio elementorum thereby restoring 
the original condition of chaos so that a new and more perfect body can be produced by a new impressio formae or imaginatio cw ii   ff

 i liber secundus  
arisen from a patchwork of human thoughts but has been forged 
from the glowing heat of the innards the cabiri themselves 
carried the matter to the mountain and consecrated the building 
with their own blood as the sole keepers of the mystery of its 
genesis i built it out of the lower and upper beyond and not from 
the surface of the world therefore it is new and strange and 
towers over the plains inhabited by humans this is the solid and 
the beginningys 
hi  i have united with the serpent of the beyond i have 
accepted everything beyond into myself from this i have built 
my beginning when this work was completed i was pleased 
and i felt curious to know what might still lie in my beyond so i 
approached my serpent and asked her  amiably whether she 
would not like to creep over to bring me news of what was 
happening in the beyond but the serpent was weary and said that 
she had no liking for this 
i i i dont want to force anything but perhaps who 
knows we will still find out something usefulfor a while the 
serpent hesitated then she disappeared into the depths soon 
i heard her voice i believe that i have reached hell there is 
a hanged man here a plain ugly man with a contorted face 
stands before me he has protruding ears and a hunchback he 
said i am a poisoner who was condemned to the rope 
i what did you do 
he i poisoned my parents and my wife 
i why did you do that 
he to honor god 
i what to honor god what do you mean by that 
he first of all everything that happens is for the honor of 
god and secondly i had my own ideas 
i what went through your mind 
he i loved them and wanted to transport them more quicdy 
from a wretched life into eternal blessedness i gave them a 
strong too strong a nightcap 
i and did this not lead you to find out what your own interest 
in this was 
he i was now alone and very unhappy i wanted to live for the 
sake of my two children for whom i foresaw a better future i was 
in better health than my wife so  i wanted to live 
i did your wife agree to the murders 
he no she certainly would have consented but she knew 
nothing of my intentions unfortunately the murder was 
discovered and i was condemned to death 
i have you found your relatives again in the beyond 
he thats a strange and unlikely story i suspect that im 
in hell sometimes it seems as if my wife were here too and 
sometimes im not sure just as little as im sure of my own self 
i what is it like tell me 
he from time to time she seems to speak to me and i reply 
but we havent spoken about either the murder or our children 
until now we only speak together here and there and only 
about trivial things small matters from our earlier daily life but 
completely impersonal as if we no longer had anything to do 
with each other but the true nature of things eludes me i see 
even less of my parents i believe that i have yet to meet my mother my father was here once and said something about his 
tobacco pipe which he had lost somewhere 
i but how do you pass your time 
he i believe that there is no time with us so there is none to 
spend nothing at all happens 
i isnt that  extremely boring 
he boring ive never thought about it like that boring 
perhaps but theres nothing interesting in actual fact its pretty 
much all the same 
i doesnt the devil ever torment you 
he the devil ive seen nothing of him 
i you come from the beyond and yet you have nothing to 
report i find that hard to believe 
he when i still had a body i often thought that surely it 
would be interesting to speak to one of the dead but now the 
prospect means nothing much to me as i said everything here 
is impersonal and purely matter of fact as far as i know thats 
what they say 
i that is bleak i assume that you are in the deepest hell 
he i dont care i guess i can go now cant i farewell 
suddenly he vanished but i turned to the serpenti and said 
what should this boring guest from the beyond mean 
s i met him over there stumbling around restlessly like so 
many others i chose him as the next best he strikes me as a 
good example 
i but is the beyond so colorless 
s it seems so there is nothing but motion when i make 
my way over there everything merely surges back and forth in a 
shadowy way there is nothing personal whatsoever 
i what is it then with this damned personal quality satan 
recently made  a strong impression on me as if he were the 
quintessence of the personal 
s of course he would since he is the eternal adversary and 
because you can never reconcile personal life with absolute life 
i cant one unite these opposites 
s they are not opposites but simply differences just as 
little as you make the day the opposite of the year or the bushel 
the opposite of the cubit 
i thats enlightening but somewhat boring 
s as always when one speaks of the beyond it goes on 
withering away particularly since we have balanced the opposites 
and married i believe the dead will soon become extinct 
hi   the devil is the sum of the darkness of human 
nature he who lives in the light strives toward being the image 
of god he who lives in the dark strives toward being the image of 
the devil because i wanted to live in the light the sun went out 
for me when i touched the depths it was dark and serpentlike 
i united myself with it and did not overpower it i took my part 
of the humiliation and subjugation upon myself in that i took 
on the nature of the serpent 
if i had  not become like the serpent the devil the quintessence 
of everything serpentlilce would have held this bit of power over 
me this would have given the devil a grip and he would have 
forced me to make a pact with him just as he also cunningly 
deceived faust but i forestalled him by uniting myself with the 
serpent just as a man unites with a woman

 so i took away from the devil the possibility of influence 
which only ever passes through ones own serpenthood which one 
commonly assigns to the devil instead of oneself mephistopheles 
is satan taken with my serpenthood satan himself is the 
quintessence of evil naked and therefore without seduction not 
even clever but pure negation without convincing force thus i 
resisted his destructive influence and grasped him and fettered 
him firmly his descendants served me and i sacrificed them 
with the sword 
thus i built a firm structure through this i myself gained 
stability and duration and could withstand the fluctuations of the 
personal therefore the immortal in me is saved through drawing 
the darkness from my beyond over into the day i emptied my 
beyond therefore the demands of the dead disappeared as they 
were satisfied 
 i am no longer threatened by the dead since i accepted 
their demands though accepting the serpent but through this i 
have also taken over something of the dead into my day yet it 
was necessary since death is the most enduring of all things that 
which can never be canceled out death gives me durability and 
solidity so long as i wanted to satisfy only my own demands i 
was personal and therefore living in the sense of the world but 
when i recognized the demands of the dead in me and satisfied 
them i gave up my earlier personal striving and the world had to 
take me for a dead man for a great cold comes over whoever in 
the excess of his personal striving has recognized the demands of 
the dead and seeks to satisfy them 
while he feels as if a mysterious poison has paralyzed the living 
quality of his personal relations the voices of the dead remain 
silent in his beyond the threat the fear and the restlessness 
cease for everything that previously lurked hungrily in him no 
longer lives with him in his day his life is beautiful and rich since 
he is himself 
but whoever always wants only the fortune of others is ugly 
since he  cripples himself a murderer is one who wants to 
force others to blessedness since he kills his own growth a 
fool is one who exterminates his love for the sake of love such 
a one is personal to the other his beyond is gray and impersonal 
he forces himself upon others therefore he is cursed into 
forcing himself upon himself in a cold nothingness he who has 
recognized the demands of the dead has banished his ugliness to 
the beyond he no longer greedily forces himself upon others 
but lives alone in beauty and speaks with the dead but there 
comes the day when the demands of the dead also are satisfied 
if one then still perseveres in solitude beauty fades into 
the beyond and the wasteland comes over onto this side a 
black stage comes after the white and heaven and hell are 
forever thereo 
i hi  now that i had found the beauty in me and 
with mysel i spoke to my serpentl
 i look back as onto a work 
that has been accomplished 
serpent nothing is accomplished yet 
i what do you mean not accomplished 
se this is only the beginning 
i i think you are lying 
se whom are you quarreling with do you know better 
 i know  nothing but id already gotten used to the idea 
 the corrected draft has instead me with the serpent p  the magician i  
that we had reached a goal at least a temporary one if even the 
dead are about to become extinct what else is going to happen 
se but then the living must first begin to live 
i this remark could certainly be deeply meaningful but it 
seems to be nothing but a joke 
se you are getting impertinent im not joking life has yet 
to begin 
 what do you mean by life 
se i say life has yet to begin didnt you feel empty today do 
you call that life 
 what you say is true but i try to put as good a face as i can 
on everything and to settle for things 
se that might be quite comfortable but you really ought to 
make much higher demands 
i that i dread i will certainly not assume that i could satisfy 
my own demands but neither do i think that you are capable 
of satisfying them however it might be that once again im not 
trusting you enough i suppose that might be so because ive drawn 
closer to you in human terms and find you so urbane 
se that proves nothing just dont assume that somehow you 
could ever grasp me and embody me 
 so what should it be im ready 
se you are entitled to a reward for  what has been 
accomplished so far 
 a sweet thought that payment could be made for this 
se i give you payment in images behold 
hi  elijah and salome the cycle is completed and the 
gates of the mysteries have opened again elijah leads salome the 
seeing one by the hand she blushes and lowers her eyes while 
lovingly batting her eyelids 
e here i give you salome may she be yours 
 for gods sake what should i do with salome i am already 
married and we are not among the turks 
e you helpless man how ponderous you are is this not a 
beautiful gift is her healing not your doing wont you accept 
her love as the welldeserved payment for your trouble 
i it seems to me a rather strange gift more burden than joy i 
am happy that salome is thankful to me and loves me i love her 
toosomewhat incidentally the care i afforded her was literally 
pressed out of me rather than something i gave freely and 
intentionally if my partly unintentional  ordeal has had such a 
good outcome im already completely satisfied 
salome to elijah leave him he is a strange man heaven 
knows what his motives are but he seems to be serious im not 
ugly and surely im generally desirable 
salome to me why do you refuse me i want to be your maid 
and serve you i will sing and dance before you fend off people 
for you comfort you when you are sad laugh with you when you 
are happy i will carry all your thoughts in my heart i will kiss the 
words that you speak to me i will pick roses for you each day and 
all my thoughts will wait upon you and surround you 
 i thank you for your love it is beautiful to hear you speak 
of love it is music and old faroff homesickness look my tears 
are falling because of your good words i want to kneel before 
you and kiss your hands a hundred times because they want to 
give me love you speak so beautifully of love one can never 
hear enough of love being spoken

 i liber secundus draft 
sal why only speak i want to be yours utterly and 
completely yours 
i you are like the serpent that coiled around me and pressed 
out my blood   your sweet words wind around me and i stand 
lile someone crucified 
sal why still crucified 
i dont you see that unrelenting necessity has flung me onto 
the cross it is impossibility that lames me 
sal dont you want to break through necessity is what you 
call a necessity really one 
i listen i doubt that it is your destiny to belong to me i do 
not want to intervene in your utterly singular life since i can never 
help you to lead it to an end and what do you gain if one day i 
must lay you aside like a worn garment 
sal your words are terrible but i love you so much that i 
could also lay myself aside when your time has come 
i i know that it would be the greatest torment for me to let 
you go away but if you can do this for me i can also do it for you 
i would go on without lament since i have not forgotten the 
dream where i saw my body lying on sharp needles and a bronze 
wheel rolling over my breast crushing it i must think of this 
dream whenever i think of love if it must be i am ready 
sal i dont want such a sacrifice i want to bring you joy can 
i not be joy to you 
i i dont know perhaps  perhaps not 
sal so then at least try 
i the attempt is the same as the act such attempts are costly 
sal wont you bear the cost for my sake 
i im rather too weak too exhausted after what i have suffered 
because of you still to be able to undertake further tasks for you 
i would be overwhelmed 
sal if you dont want to accept me then surely i cannot 
accept you 
i its not a matter of acceptance if its about anything in 
particular its about giving 
sal but i do give myself to you just accept me 
i as if that would settle the matter but being entangled with 
love simply thinking about it is dreadful 
sal so you really demand that i be and not be at the same time 
that is impossible whats wrong with you 
i i lack the strength to hoist another fate onto my shoulders 
i have enough to carry 
sal but what if i help you bear this load 
i how can you youd have to carry me an untamed burden 
shouldnt i have to carry it myself 
e youspeak the truth may each one cary his load he who 
wants to burden others with his baggage is their slaves it is not 
too difficult for anyone to lug themselves 
sal but father couldnt i help him bear part of his burden 
e then hed be your slave  
sal or my master and ruler 
i that i shall not be you should be a free being i can bear 
neither slaves nor masters i long for men 
sal am i not a human being 
i be your own master and your own slave do not belong to 
me but to yourself do not bear my burden but your own thus you leave me my human freedom a thing thats worth more to 
me than the right of ownership over another person 
sal are you sending me away 
i im not sending you away you must not be far from me 
but give to me out of your fullness not your longing i cannot 
satisfy your poverty just as you cannot still my longing if your 
harvest is rich send me some fruit from your garden if you suf
fer from abundance i will drink from the brimming horn of your 
joy i know that that will be a balm for me i can satisfy myself 
only at the table of the satisfied not at the empty bowls of those 
who yearn i will not steal my payment you possess nothing so 
how can you give insofar as you give you demand elijah old 
man listen you have a strange gratitude do not give away your 
daughter but set her  on her own feet she would like to dance 
to sing or play the lute before people and she would like their 
flashing coins thrown before her feet salome i thank you for 
your love if you really love me dance before the crowd please 
people so that they praise your beauty and your art and if you 
have a rich harvest throw me one of your roses through the 
window and if the fount of your joy overflos dance and sing 
to me once more i long for the joy of men for their fullness and 
freedom and not their neediness 
sal what a hard and incomprehensible man you are 
e you have changed since i last saw you you speak another 
language one that sounds foreign to me 
 my dear old man id like to believe that you find me changed 
but you too seem to have changed where is your serpent 
e she has gone astray i believe she was stolen since then 
things have been somewhat gloomy with us therefore i would 
have been happy if you had at least accepted my daughter 
i i know where your serpent is i have her we fetched 
her from the underworld she  gave me hardness wisdom and 
magical power we need her in the upperworld since otherwise 
the underworld would have had the advantage to our detriment 
e waywith you accursed robber may god punish you 
i your curse is powerless whoever possesses the serpent 
cannot be touched by curses no be sensible old man whoever 
possesses wisdom is not greedy for power only the man who 
has power declines to use it do not cry salome fortune is only 
what you yourself create and not what comes to you be gone my 
unhappy friends the night grows late elijah expunge the false 
gleam of power from your wisdom and you salome for the sake 
of our love do not forget to dance 
 when everything was completed in me i unexpectedly 
returned to the mysteries to that first sight of the otherworldly 
powers of the spirit and desire just as i had achieved pleasure 
in myself and power over myself salome had lost pleasure in 
herself but learned love for the other and elijah had lost the 
power of his wisdom but he had learned to recognize the spirit 
of the other salome thus lost the power of temptation and has 
 become love as i have won pleasure in mysel i also want 
love for myself but that really would be too much and would 
bind me like an iron ring that would stifle me i accepted salome 
as pleasure and reject her as love but she wants to be with me 
how then should i also have love for myself love i believe 
 jungs marginal note to the calligraphic volume in xi cap of the mystery play see above p

life has imposed on me  serpent what principles are these pp

draft belongs to others but my love wants to be with me i dread it 
may the power of my thinking push it from me into the world 
into things into men for something should join men together 
something should be a bridge it is the most difficult temptation 
if even my love wants me mysteries open your curtains again 
i want to wage this battle to its end come here serpent of the 
dark abyss 
 i hear salome still crying what does she want or 
what do i still want its a damnable payment you have given to 
me a payment that one cannot touch without sacrifice one that 
requires even greater sacrifice once one has touched it 
serpent do you mean to live without sacrifice life must 
cost you something mustnt it 
i i have i believe already paid i have rejected salome is that 
not sacrifice enough 
se too little for you as has been said you are allowed to 
make demands of yourself 
i you mean well with your damned logic demanding in 
sacrifice that  isnt what i understood my error has obviously 
been to my own benefit tell me isnt it enough if i force my feeling 
into the background 
se youre not forcing your feeling into the background at all 
rather it suits you much better not to agonize further over salome 
i if youre speaking the truth its quite bad is that why 
salome is still crying 
se yes it is 
i but what is to be done 
se oh you want to act one can also think 
i but what is there to think i confess that i know nothing to 
think here perhaps you have advice i have the feeling that i must 
soar over my own head i cant do that what do you think 
se i think nothing and have no advice either 
i so ask the beyond go to heaven or hell perhaps there is 
advice there 
se i am being pulled upward 
then the serpent turned into a small white bird which soared 
into the clouds where she disappeared my gaze followed her for 
a long time 
bird do you hear me im far off now heaven is so far away 
hell is much nearer the earth i found something for you a 
discarded crown it lay on a street in the immeasurable space of 
heaven a golden crown 
and now it already lies in my hand a golden royal crown 
with lettering incised within what does it say love never ends 
a gift from heaven but what does it mean 
b here i am are you satisfied 
i partiallyat any rate i thank you for this meaningful gift 
but it is mysterious and your gift makes me wellnigh suspicious 
b but the gift comes from heaven you know 
i its certainly very beautiful but you know very well what we 
have grasped of heaven and hell 
b dont exaggerate after all there is a difference between 
heaven and hell i certainly believe to judge from what i have 
 february ii  
 in black book  this figure is identified as soul p  
 this sentence is added in the draft p  the magician i  
seen that just as little happens in heaven as in hell though 
probably in another way even what does not occur cannot occur 
in a particular way 
i you speak in riddles that could make one ill if one took 
them to heart tell me what do you make of the crown 
b what do i make of it nothing it truly speaks for itself 
i you mean through the inscription it bears 
b precisely i presume that makes sense to you 
i to some extent i suppose but that keeps the question 
awfully in suspense 
b which is how it is meant to be 
now the bird suddenly turned into the serpent again 
i youre unnerving 
serpent only for him who isnt in agreement with me 
i that i am certainly not but how could one to hang in the 
air in such a way is gruesome 
se is this sacrifice too difficult for you you must also be able 
to hang if you want to solve problems look at salome 
i to salome i see salome that you are still weeping you are 
not yet done for i hover and curse my hovering i am hanging 
for your sake and for mine first i was crucified now im simply 
hangingwhich is less noble but no less agonizing forgive me 
for wanting to do you in i thought of saving you as i did when i 
healed your blindness through my selfsacrifice perhaps i must 
be decapitated a third time for your sake like your earlier friend 
john who brought us the christ of agony are you insatiable do 
you still see no way to become reasonable 
sal my beloved what can i do for you i have utterly 
forsaken you 
i so why are you still crying you know i cant bear seeing 
you in tears 
sal i thought that you were invulnerable since you possessed 
the black serpent rod 
i the effect of the rod seems doubtful to me but in one 
respect it does help me at least i do not suffocate although i 
have been strung up the magic rod apparently helps me bear the 
hanging surely a gruesome good deed and aid dont you at least 
want to cut the cord 
sal how can i you are hanging too high high on the 
summit of the tree of life where i cannot reach cant you help 
yousel you knower of serpent wisdom 
i must i go on hanging for long 
sal until you have devised help for yourself 
i so at least tell me what you think of the crown that the bird 
of my soul fetched for me from heaven 
sal what are you saying the crown you have the crown 
lucky one what are you complaining about 
i a hanged king would like to change places with every 
blessed beggar on the country road who has not been hanged 
sal ecstatic the crown you have the crown 
i salome take pity on me what is it with the crown 
sal ecstatic the crownyou are to be crowned what 
blessedness for me and you

 i liber secundus draft 
i alas what do you want with the crown i cant understand 
it and im sffering unspeakable torment 
sal cruelly hang until you understand 
i remain silent and hang high above the ground on the 
swaying branch of the divine tree for whose sake the original 
ancestors could not avoid sin my hands are bound and i am 
completely helpless so i hang for three days and three nights 
from where should help come there sits my bird the serpent 
which has put on her white feather dress 
bird well fetch help from the clouds trailing above your 
head when nothing else is of help to us 
i you want to fetch help from the clouds how is that possible 
b i will go and try 
the bird swings off like a rising lark becomes smaller and 
smaller and finally disappears in the thick gray veil of clouds 
covering the sky my gaze follows her longingly and i make 
out nothing more than the endless gray cloudy sky above me 
impenetrably gray harmoniously gray and unreadable but the 
writing on the crownthat is legible love never endsdoes 
that mean eternal hanging i was not wrong to be suspicious when 
my bird brought the crown the crown of eternal life the crown of 
martyrdomominous things that are dangerously ambiguous 
i am weary weary not only of hanging but of struggling after 
the immeasurable the mysterious crown lies far below my feet 
on the ground winking gold i do not hover no i hang or rather 
worse i am hanged between sky and earthand do not tire of 
the state of hanging for i could indulge in it forever but love never 
ends is it really true shall love nver end if this was a blessed 
message to them what is it for me 
that depends entirely on the notion an old raven suddenly 
said perched on a branch not far from me awaiting the funeral 
meal and immersed in philosophizing 
i why does it depend entirely on the notion 
raven on your notion of love and the other 
i i know unlucky old bird you mean heavenly and earthly 
love heavenly love would be utterly beautiful but we are men 
and precisely because we are men ive set my mind on being a 
complete and fullfledged man 
r youre an ideologue 
 i dumb raven be gone 
there very close to my face a branch moves a black serpent 
has coiled itself around it and looks at me with the blinding pearly 
shimmer of its eyes is it not my serpent 
i sister and black rod of magic where do you come from i 
thought that i saw you fly to heaven as a bird and now you are 
here do you bring help 
serpent i am only my own half im not one but two im the 
one and the other i am here only as the serpentlike the magical 
but magic is useless here i wound myself idly around this branch 
to await further developments you can use me in life but not 
in hanging in the worst case im ready to lead you to hades i 
know the way there 
a black form condenses before me out of the air satan 
with a scornful laugh he calls to me see what comes from the 
reconciliation of opposites recant and in a flash youll be down 
on the greening earth i i wont recant im not stupid if such is the outcome of all 
this let it be the end 
se where is your inconsistency please remember this 
important rule of the art of life 
i the fact that im hanging here is inconsistency enough ive 
lived inconsistently ad nauseam what more do you want 
se perhaps inconsistency in the right place 
i stop it how should i know what the right and the wrong 
places are 
satan whoever gets on in a sovereign way with the opposites 
knows left from right 
i be quiet youre an interested party if only my white bird 
came back with help i fear im growing weak 
se dont be stupid weakness too is a way magic makes good 
the error 
satan what youve not yet once had the courage of weakness 
you want to become a complete manare men strong 
i white bird of mine i suppose you cant find your way back 
did you get up and leave because you couldnt live with me ah 
salome there she comes come to me salome another night 
has passed i didnt hear you cry but i hung and still hang 
sal i havent cried anymore for good fortune and misfortune 
are balanced in me 
i my white bird has left and has not yet returned i know 
nothing and understand nothing does this have to do with the 
crown speak 
sal what should i say ask yourself 
i i cannot my brain is like lead i can only whimper for help 
i have no way of knowing whether everything is falling or standing 
still my hope is with my white bird oh no could it be that the 
bird means the same thing as hanging 
satan reconciliation of the opposites equal rights for 
all follies 
i i hear a bird chirping is that you have you come back 
bird if you love the earth you are hanged if you love the sky 
you hover 
i what is earth what is sky 
b everything under you is the earth everything above you is 
the sky you fly if you strive for what is above you you are hanged 
if you strive for what is below you 
i what is above me what is beneath me 
b bove you is what is before and over you beneath you is 
what comes back under you 
i nd the crown solve the riddle of the crown for me 
b the crown and serpent are opposites and are one did you 
not see the serpent that crowned the head of the crucified 
i what i dont understand you 
b what words did the crown bring you love never ends
that is the mystery of the crown and the serpent 
i but salome what should happen to salome 
b you see salome is what you are fly and she will grow wings 
the clouds part the sky is full of the crimson sunset of the 
completed third day the sun sinks into the sea and i glide with 
it from the top of the tree toward the earth softly and peacefully 
night falls

me up yourselves turning me into a tower on inaccessible crags 
turning me into my church my monastery my place of execution 
my prison i am locked up and condemned within myself i am 
my own priest and congregation judge and judged god and 
human sacrifice 
what a work you have accomplished cabiri you have given 
birth to a cruel law from the chaos that cannot be revoked it is 
understood and accepted 
the completion of the secret operation approaches what 
i saw i described in words to the best of my ability words are 
poor and beauty does not attend them but is truth beautiful and 
beauty true 
one can speak in beautiful words about love but about life 
and life stands above love but love is the inescapable mother 
of life life should never be forced into love but love into life 
may love be subject to torment but not life as long as love goes 
pregnant with life it should be respected but if it has given birth 
to life from itsel it has turned into an empty sheath and expires 
into transience 
i speak against the mother who bore me i separate myself 
from the bearing womb i speak no more for the sake of love 
but for the sake of life 
the word has become heavy for me and it barely wrestles 
itself free of the soul bronze doors have shut fires have burned 
out and sunk into ashes wells have been drained and where there 
were seas there is dry land my tower stands in the desert happy 
is he who can be a hermit in his own desert he survives 
not the power of the flesh but of love should be broken for 
the sake of life since life stands above love a man needs his 
mother until his life has developed then he separates from her 
and so life needs love until it has developed then it will cut loose 
from it the separation of the child from the mother is difficult 
but the separation of life from love is harder love seeks to have 
and to hold but life wants more 
the beginning of all things is love but the being of things is 
lifeo this distinction is terrible why oh spirit of the darkest 
depths do you force me to say that whoever loves does not live 
and whoever lives does not love i always get it backward should 
everything be turned into its opposite will there be a sea where 
iiahmnns temple stands will his shady island sink into the 
deepest ground into the whirlpool of the withdrawing flood 
that earlier swallowed all peoples and lands will the bottom of 
the sea be where ararat arises 
what repulsive words do you mutter you mute son of the earth 
you want to sever my souls embrace you my son do you thrust 
yourself between who are you and who gives you the power 
everything that i strove for everything i wrested from mysel do 
you want to reverse it again and destroy it you are the son of the 
devil to whom everything holy is inimical you grow overpowering the mag i clan i  
you frighten me let me be happy in the embrace of my soul and 
do not disturb the peace of the temple 
off with you you pierce me with paralyzing force for i do not 
want your way should i languidly fall at your feet you devil and 
son of the devil speak your silence is unbearable and of awful 
stupidity 
i won my soul and to what did she give birth for me you 
monster a son haa frightful miscreant a stammerer a newts 
brain a primordial lizard you want to be king of the earth you 
want to banish proud free men bewitch beautiful women break

you want to call yourself my son youre no son of mine but the 
spawn of the devil the father of the devil entered into the womb

 i liber secundus draft 
come to pass it has come to pass and we will have to see how you 
can do it better in the future take a pound of otter lard bury it 
in the earth and let nine months pass then dig up that place 
again and see what you find so the king went to his house 
ashamed and saddened because he had humiliated himself 
before the witch in the forest yet he listened to her advice dug 
a hole in the garden at night and placed a pot of otter lard in 
it which he had obtained with some difficulty then he let nine 
months go by 
fter this time had passed he went again by night to the 
place where the pot lay buried and dug it up to his great 
astonishment he found a sleeping infant in the pot though the lard 
had disappeared he took out the infant and jubilantly brought it 
to his wife she took it immediately to her breast and beholdher 
milk flowed freely and so the child thrived and became great and 
strong he grew into a man who was greater and stronger than all 
others when the kings son was twenty years old he came before 
his father and said i know that you have produced me through 
sorcery and that i was not born as one of men you have made me 
from the repentance of your sins and this has made me strong i 
am born from no woman which makes me clever i am strong and 
clever and therefore i demand the crown of the realm from you 
the old king was startled at his sons knowledge but even more 
by his impetuous longing for regal power he remained silent and 
thought what has produced you otter lard who bore you the 
womb of the earth i drew you from a pot a witch humiliated me 
and he decided to let his son be killed secretly 
but because his sop was stronger than others he feared him 
and therefore he wanted to talce refuge in a trick he went again 
to the sorceress in the forest and asked her for advice she said 
dear king you confess no sin to me this time because you want 
to commit a sin i advise you to bury another pot with otters 
lard and leave it to lie in the earth for nine months then dig 
it out again and see what has happened the king did what the 
sorceress advised him and thenceforth his son became weaker 
and weaker and when the king returned to the place where the 
pot lay after nine months he could dig his sons grave at the same 
time he lay the dead one in the fosse beside the empty pot 
but the king was saddened and when he could no longer 
master his melancholy he returned yet again to the sorceress one 
night and asked her for advice she spoke to him dear king you 
wanted a son but the son wanted to be king himself and also had 
the power and cleverness for it and then you wanted your son no 
more because of this you lost your son why are you complaining 
you have everything dear king that you wanted but the king 
said you are right i wanted it so but i did not want this 
melancholy do you have any remedies against remorse the 
sorceress spoke dear king go to your sons grave fill the pot 
again with otters lard and after nine months see what you find 
in the pot the icing did this as he had been commanded and 
henceforth he became happy and did not know why 
when the nine months had passed he dug out the pot again 
the body had disappeared but in the pot there lay a sleeping 
infant and he realized that the infant was his dead son he 
took the infant to himself and henceforth he grew as much in 
a week as other infants grow in a year and when twenty weeks 
had passed the son came before the father again and claimed his 
realm but the father had learned from experience and already 
knew for a long time how everything would turn out after the 
 black book  has ambition p  
 black book  has work instead of son in the next few lines p  son had voiced his demand the old king got up from his throne 
and embraced his son with tears of joy and crowned him king 
and so the son who had thus become king was grateful to his 
father and held him in high esteem as long as his father was 
granted life 
but i spoke to my serpent in truth my serpent i didnt know 
that you are also a teller of fairy tales so tell me how should i 
interpret your fairy tale 
se imagine that you are the old king and have a son 
i who is the son 
se well i thought that you had just spoken of a son who 
doesnt make you very happy 
i what you dont meanthat i should crown him 
se yes who else 
i thats uncanny but what about the sorceress 
se the sorceress is a motherly woman whose son you should 
be since you are a child renewing himself in you 
i oh no will it be impossible for me to be a man 
se sufficient manhood and beyond that fullness of child
hood which is why you need the mother 
i im ashamed to be a child 
se nd thus you kill your son a creator needs the mother 
since you are not a woman 
i this is a terrible truth i thought and hoped that i could be 
a man in every way 
se you cannot do this for the sake of the son to create 
means mother and child 
i the thought that i must remain a child is unbearable 
se for the sake of your son you must be a child and leave him 
the crown 
i the thought that i must remain a child is humiliating and 
shattering 
se a salutary antidote against power dont resist being a 
child otherwise you resist your son whom you want above all 
i its true i want the son and survival but the price for this 
is high 
se the son stands higher you are smaller and weaker than 
the son that is a bitter truth but it cant be avoided dont be 
defiant children must be wellbehaved 
i damned scorn 
se man of mockery ill have patience with you my wells 
should flow for you and pour forth the drink of salvation if all 
lands parch with thirst and everyone comes to you begging for the 
water of life so subject yourself to the son 
i where am i going to take hold of the immeasurable my 
knowledge and ability are poor my power is not enough 
at which the serpent curled up gathered herself into knots 
and said do not ask after the morrow sufficient unto you is the 
day you need not worry about the means let everything grow 
let everything sprout the son grows out of himself 
 the myth commences the one that need only be lived 
not sung the one that sings itself i subject myself to the son 
the one engendered by sorcery the unnaturally born the son 
of the frogs who stands at the waterside and speaks with his 
fathers and listens to their nocturnal singing truly he is full 
of mysteries and superior in strength to all men no man has 
produced him and no woman has given birth to him

the absurd has entered the ageold mother and the son has 
grown in the deepest ground he sprang up and was put to death 
he rose again was produced anew in the way of sorcery and grew 
more swiftly than before i gave him the crown that unites the 
separated and so he unites the separated for me i gave him the 
power and thus he commands since he is superior in strength and 
cleverness to all others 
i did not give way to him willingly but out of insight no 
man binds above and below together but he who did not grow 
like a man and yet has the form of a man is capable of binding 
them my power is paralyzed but i survive in my son i set aside 
my concern that he may master the people i am solitary the 
people rejoice at him i was powerful now i am powerless i was 
strong now i am weak since then he has talcen all the strength 
into himself everything has turned itself upside down for me 
i loved the beauty of the beautiful the spirit of those rich in 
spirit the strength of the strong i laughed at the stupidity of the 
stupid i despised the weakness of the wealc the meanness of the 
mean and hated the badness of the bad but now i must love the 
beauty of the ugly the spirit of the foolish and the strength of the 
weak i must admire the stupidity of the clever must respect the 
weakness of the strong and the meanness of the generous and 
honor the goodness of the bad where does that leave mockery 
contempt and hatred 
they went over to the son as a token of power his mockery 
is bloody and how contemptuously his eyes flash his hatred is a 
singing fire enviable one you son of the gods how can one fail 
to obey you he broke me in two he cut me up he yokes the 
separated without him i would fall apart but my life went on 
with him my love remained with me 
thus i entered solitude with a black look on my face full of 
resentment and outrage at my sons dominion how could my son 
arrogate my power i went into my gardens and sat down in a 
lonely spot on rocks by the water and brooded darkly i called the 
serpent my nocturnal companion who lay with me on the rocks 
through many twilights imparting her serpent wisdom but then 
my son emerged from the water great and powerful the crown 
on his head with a swirling lions mane shimmering serpent skin 
covering his body he said to me 
 r i come to you and demand your life 
i what do you mean have you even become a god 
he i rise again i had become flesh now i return to eternal 
glitter and shimmer to the eternal embers of the sun and leave 
you your earthliness you will remain with men you have been in 
immortal company long enough your work belongs to the earth 
i what a speech werent you wallowing in the earth and 
the underearth 
he i had become man and beast and now ascend again to my 
own country 
i where is your country 
he in the light in the egg in the sun in what is innermost 
and compressed in the eternal longing embers so rises the sun 
in your heart and streams out into the cold world 
i how you transfigure yourself 
he i want to vanish from your sight you ought to live in 
darkest solitude mennot godsshould illumine your darkness

what am i asking youll talk to me again tomorrow youll chat 
over and over in the mirror 
he do not rail i will be present and not present you will 
hear and not hear me i will be and not be 
i you utter gruesome riddles 
he such is my language and to you i leave the understanding 
no one besides you has your god he is always with you yet you 
see him in others and thus he is never with you you strive to 
draw to yourself those who seem to possess your god you will 
come to see that they do not possess him and that you alone have 
him thus you are alone among menin the crowd and yet alone 
solitude in multitudeponder this 
i i suppose i ought to remain silent after what you have 
said but i cannot my heart bleeds when i see you go from me

longing toward eternal light swells up powerfully in me you can 
no longer stop me stop your tears and let me ascend with cries 
of joy you are a man of the fields think of your crops i become

scrutinies 
i i resist i cannot accept this hollow nothing that i am 
what am i what is my i i always presuppose my i now it stands 
before mei before my i i speak now to you my i 
iwe are alone and our being together threatens to become 
unbearably boring we must do something devise a pastime for 
example i could educate you let us begin with your main flaw 
which strikes me first you have no correct selfesteem have you 
no good qualities that you can be proud of you believe that 
being capable is an art but one can also learn such skills to some 
extent please do so you find it difficultwell all beginnings 
are difficult soon you will be able to do it better do you doubt 
this that is of no use you must be able to do it or else i cannot 
live with you ever since the god has arisen and spreads himself 
in whichever fiery heavens to do whatever he does what exactly 
i do not know we have depended upon one another therefore 
you must think about improving or else our life together will 
become wretched so pull yourself together and value yourself 
dont you want to 
pitiful creature i will torment you a bit if you do not make an 
effort what are you moaning about perhaps the whip will help 
now that gets under your skin doesnt it take thatand that 
what does it taste of of blood presumably of the middle ages 
in majorem dei gloriam 
or do you want love or what goes by that name one can also 
teach with love ifblows do not bear fruit so should i love you 
press you tenderly to myself 
i truly believe that you are yawning 
how now you want to speak but i wont let you otherwise in 
the end you will claim that you are my soul but my soul is with 
the fire worm with the son of the frog who has flown to the heavens 
above to the upper sources do i know what he is doing there 
but you are not my soul you are my bare empty nothing i this 
disagreeable being whom one cannot even deny the right to 
consider itself worthless 
one could despair over you your sensitivity and desirousness 
exceed any reasonable measure and i should live with you of all 
people i must since the strange misfortune occurred that gave 
me a son and took him away 
i regret that i must speak such truths to you yes you 
are laughably sensitive selfrighteous unruly mistrustful 
pessimistic cowardly dishonest with yoursel venomous venge
ful one can hardly speak about your childish pride your craving 
for power your desire for esteem your laughable ambition 
your thirst for fame without feeling sick the playacting and 
pomposity become you badly and you abuse them to the best 
of your ability 
do you believe that it is a pleasure rather than a horror to live 
together with you no three times no but i promise you that i 
will tighten the vise around you and slowly pull off your skin i 
will give you the chance to be flayed 
you you of all people wanted to tell other people what to do 
come here i will stitch a cloth of new skin onto you so that 
you can feel its effect 
you want to complain about others and that one has done an 
injustice to you not understood you misinterpreted you hurt 
i april i ii 
 all beginnings are difficult is a proverb from the talmud 
 to the greater glory of god this was the motto of the jesuits 
 see below note i p  your feelings ignored you not recognized you falsely accused 
you and what else do you see your vanity in this your eternally 
ridiculous vanity 
you complain that the torment has not yet come to an end 
let me tell you it has only just begun you have no patience 
and no seriousness only when it concerns your pleasure do 
you praise your patience i will double the torment so that you 
learn patience 
you find the pain unbearable but there are other things that 
hurt even more and you can inflict them on others with the 
greatest naivety and absolve yourself all unknowingly 
but you will learn silence for this i will pullout your 
tonguewith which you have ridiculed blasphemed andeven 
worsejoked i will pin all your unjust and depraved words 
one by one to your body with needles so that you can feel how 
evil words stab 
do you admit that you also derive pleasure from this torment 
i will increase this pleasure until you vomit with joy so that you 
know what taking pleasure in selftorment means 
you rise against me i am screwing the vise tighter thats 
all i will break your bones until there is no longer a trace of 
hardness there 
for i want to get along with youi mustdamn youyou are 
my i which i must carry around with me to the grave do you 
think that i want to have such foolishness around me all my life 
if you were not my  i would have torn you to pieces long ago 
but i am damned to haul you through a purgatory so that you 
too will become somewhat acceptable 
you calion god for help 
the dear old god has died and it is good that way otherwise 
he would have had pity on your repentant sinfulness and spared 
me the execution by granting mercy you must know that nei
ther a god of love nor a loving god has yet arisen but instead 
a worm of fire crawled up a magnificent frightful entity that 
lets fire rain on the earth producing lamentationss so cry to the 
god he will burn you with fire for the forgiveness of your sins 
coil yourself and sweat blood you have needed this cure for a 
long time yesothers always do wrongand you you are the 
innocent the correct you must defend your good right and you 
have a good loving god on your side who always forgives sins 
with pity others must reach insight not you since you have a 
monopoly on all insight from the start and are always convinced 
that you are right and so cry really loudly to your dear godhe 
will hear you and let fire fallon you have you not noticed that 
your god has become a fiery worm with a flat skull who crawls 
redhot on the earth 
you wanted to be superior how laughable you were and are 
inferior who are you then scum that disgusts me 
are you perhaps somewhat powerless i place you in a corner 
where you can remain lying until you come to your senses again 
if you no longer feel anything the procedure is of no use after 
all we must proceed skillfully it really says a lot about you that 
one needs such barbaric means for your amendment your progress 
since the early middle ages appears to be minuscule 
did you feel dejected today inferior debased shall i tell 
you why

 i scrutinies 
your inordinate ambition is boundless your grounds are not 
focused on the good of the matter but on your vanity you do not 
work for humanity but for your selfinterest you do not strive for 
the completion of the thing but for the general recognition and 
safeguarding of your own advantage i want to honor you with a 
prickly crown of iron it has teeth inside that bore themselves 
into your flesh 
and now we come to the vile swindle that you pursue with your 
cleverness you speak skillfully and abuse your capability and 
discolor tone down strengthen apportion light and shade and 
loudly proclaim your honorableness and upright good faith you 
exploit the good faith of others you gloatingly catch them in your 
snares and speal of your benevolent superiority and the prize 
that you are for others you play at modesty and do not mention 
your merit in the certain hope that someone else will do it for 
you you are disappointed and hurt if this doesnt happen 
you preach hypocritical composure but when it really matters 
are you calm no you lie you consume yourself in rage and your 
tongue speaks cold daggers and you dream of revenge 
you are gloating and resentful you begrudge the other the 
sunshine since you would like to assign it to those whom you 
favor because they favor you you are envious of all wellbeing 
around you and you impertinently assert the opposite 
inside yourself you think unsparingly and coarsely only what 
always suits you and with this you feel yourself above human
ity and not in the least responsible but you are responsible to 
humanity in everything that you think feel and do do not pretend 
there is a difference between thinking and doing you rely only on 
your undeserved advantage not to be compelled to say or do what 
you think and feel 
but you are shameless in everything where no one sees you 
if another said that to you you woul be mortally offended 
despite knowing that it is true you want to reproach others for 
their failings so that they better themselves yes confess have 
you bettered yourself from where do you get the right to have 
opinions of others what is your opinion about yourself and 
what are the good grounds that support it your grounds are 
webs of lies covering a dirty corner you judge others and charge 
them with what they should do you do this because you have no 
order within yourself because you are unclean 
and thenhow do you really think it appears to me that you 
even think with men regardless of their human dignity you dare 
think by means of them and use them as figures on your stage as 
if they were how you conceive them have you ever considered 
that you thus commit a shameful act of power as bad as that for 
which you condemn others namely that they love their fellow 
men as they claim but in reality exploit them to their own ends 
your sin flourishes in seclusion but it is no less great remorseless 
and coarse 
what is concealed in you i will drag out into the light 
shameless one i will crush your superiority under my feet 
do not speak to me about your love what you call love oozes 
with selfinterest and desirousness but you speak about it with 
great words and the greater your words are the more pathetic 
 aprili ii your socalled love is never speak to me of your love but keep 
your mouth shut it lies 
i want you to speak about your shame and that instead of 
speaking great words you utter a discordant clamor before 
those whose respect you wanted to exact you deserve mockery 
not respect 
i will burn out of you the contents of which you were proud so 
that you will become empty like a pouredout vessel you should 
be proud of nothing more than your emptiness and wretchedness 
you should be a vessel of life so kill your idols 
freedom does not belong to you but form not power but 
suffering and conceiving 
you should make a virtue out of your selfcontempt which i 
will spread out before men like a carpet they should wall over it 
with dirty feet and you should see to it that you are dirtier than 
all the feet that step on you 
if i tame you beast i give others the opportunity to tame 
their beasts the taming begins with you my i nowhere else not 
that you stupid brother i had been particularly wild there are 
some who are wilder but i must whip you until you endure the 
wildness of the others then i can live with you if someone does 
you wrong i will torment you to death until you have forgiven 
the wrong suffered yet not just by paying lip service but also in 
your heavy heart with its heinous sensitivity your sensitivity is 
your particular form of violence 
therefore listen brother in my solitude i have prepared every 
kind of torture for you if it should ever occur to you again to be 
sensitive you should feel inferior you should be able to bear the 
fact that one calls your purity dirty and that one desires your 
dirtiness that one praises your wastefulness as miserliness and 
your greed as a virtue 
fill your bealer with the bitter drink of subjugation since you 
are not your soul your soul is with the fiery god who flamed up 
to the roof of the heavens 
should you still be sensitive i notice that you are forging 
secret plans for revenge plotting deceitful tricks but you are an 
idiot you cannot take revenge on fate childish one you probably 
even want to lash the sea build better bridges instead that is a 
better way to squander your wit 
you want to be understood thats all we needed understand 
yourself and you will be sufficiently understood you will have 
quite enough work in hand with that mothers little dears 
want to be understood understand yourself that is the best 
protection against sensitivity and satisfies your childish longing 
to be understood i suppose you want to turn others into slaves of 
your desirousness again but you know that i must live with you 
and that i will no longer tolerate such abject plaintiveness 
 mter i had spoken these and many more angry words to my 
i i noticed that i began to bear being alone with myself but 
the touchiness still stirred in me frequently and i had to lash 
myself just as often and i did this until even the pleasure in 
selftorment faded 
 jung later described the selfcriticism depicted in this opening section as the confrontation with the shadow in i he wrote whoever looks into the mirror of the 
water will see first of all his own image whoever goes to himself risks a confrontation with himself the mirror does not flatter it faithfully shows whatever looks into 
it namely the face we never show to the world because we cover it with the persona the mask of the actor but the mirror lies behind the mask and shows the true face 
this confrontation is the first test of courage on the inner way a test sufficient to frighten off most people for the meeting with ourselves belongs to the more unpleasant 
things that can be avoided as long as one can project everything negative into the environment but if we are able to see our own shadow and can bear knowing about it 
then a small part of the problem has already been solved we have at least brought up the personal unconscious on the archetypes of the collective unconscious cw

iothen i heard a voice one night it came from afar and was the 
voice of my soul she spoke how distant you are 
i is that you my soul from which height and distance do 
you speak 
s i am above you i am a world apart i have become sunlike 
i received the seeds of fire where are you i can hardly find you 
in your mists 
i i am down on the murky earth in the dark smoke that 
the fire left us and my gaze does not reach you but your voice 
sounds closer 
s i feel it the heaviness of the earth penetrates me damp cold 
enshrouds me gloomy memories of former pain overcome me 
i do not lower yourself into the smoke and the darkness of 
the earth i would like that which i am still working on to remain 
sunlike otherwise i will lose the courage to live further down in 
the darkness of the earth let me just hear your voice i will never 
want to see you in the flesh again say something take it from the 
depths from which fear perhaps flows to me 
s i cannot since your creative source flows from there 
i you see my uncertainty 
s the uncertain way is the good way upon it lie possibilities 
be unwavering and create 
i heard the rushing of wings i knew that the bird rose 
higher above the clouds in the fiery brilliance of the outspread 
godhead 
iii turned to my brother the i he stood sadly and looked at the 
ground and sighed and would rather have been dead since the 
burden of enormous suffering burdened him but a voice spoke 
from me and said 
it is hardthe sacrificed fall left and rightand you will be 
crucified for the sake of life 
and i said to my i my brother how do you like this speech 
but he sighed deeply and moaned it is bitter and i suffer much 
to which i answered i know but it is not to be altered but 
i did not know what that was since i still did not know what the 
future held this happened on the ist may of the year ii in 
the excess of suffering i looked up to the clouds and called out to 
my soul and asked her and i heard her voice happy and bright 
and she answered 
much happiness has happened to me i rise higher cmy 
wings grow 
i was seized with bitterness at these words and i cried you 
live from the blood of the human heart 
i heard her laughingor was she not laughing no drink is 
dearer to me than red blood 
powerless anger seized me and i called out if you were not 
my soul who followed the god to the eternal realm i would 
call you the most terrible scourge of men but who moves you 
i know that divinity is not humanity the divine consumes the 
human i know that this is the severity this is the cruelty he who 
has felt you with his hands can never remove the blood from his 
hands i have become enslaved to you 
she answered do not be angry do not complain let the 
bloody victims fall at your side it is not your severity it is 
not your cruelty but necessity the way of life is sown with 
fallen ones scrutinies i  
 yes i see it is a battlefield my brother what is with you 
are you groaning 
then my i answered why should i not groan and moan i 
load myself with the dead and cannot haul their number 
but i did not understand my i and therefore spoke to him 
you are a pagan my friend have you not heard that it is said 
let the dead bury their deadi why do you want to be burdened 
with the dead you do not help them by hauling them 
then my i wailed but i pity the poor fallen ones they cannot 
reach the light perhaps if i haul them 
 what is this their souls have accomplished as much as 
they could then they encountered fate it will also happen to us 
your compassion is sick 
but my soul called from afar leave him compassion compassion 
binds life and death 
these words of my soul stung me she spoke of compassion 
she who rose up following the god without compassion and i 
asked her 
why did you do that 
for my human sensitivity could not grasp the hideousness of 
that hour she answered 
it is not meant for me to be in your world i besmirch myself 
on the excrement of your earth 
i am i not earth am i not excrement did i commit an 
error that forced you to follow the god into the upper realms 
s no it was inner necessity i belong to the above 
i has no one suffered an irreplaceable loss through 
your disappearance 
s on the contrary you have enjoyed utmost benefit 
 if i heed my human feeling about this doubt could come 
over me 
s what have you noticed why should what you see always be 
untrue it is your particular wrong that you cannot stop making a 
fool of yourself can you not remain on your way for once 
i you know that i doubt because of my love for men 
s no for the sake of your weakness for the sake of your 
doubt and disbelief stay on your way and do not run away from 
yourself there is a divine and a human intention they cross 
each other in stupid and godforsaken people to whom you also 
belong from time to time 
since what my soul spoke about referred to nothing that i 
could see nor could i see what my i suffered from since this 
happened two months before the outbreak of the war i wanted 
to understand it all as personal experiences within me and 
consequently i could neither understand nor believe it all since 
my belief is weak and i believe that it is better in our time if 
belief is weak we have outgrown that childhood where mere 
belief was the most suitable means to bring men to what is good 
and reasonable therefore if we wanted to have a strong belief 
again today we would thus return to that earlier childhood but 
we have so much knowledge and such a thirst for knowledge in 
us that we need knowledge more than belief but the strength of 
belief would hinder us from attaining knowledge belief certainly 
may be something strong but it is empty and too little of the 
whole man can be involved if our life with god is grounded 
only on belief should we simply believe first and foremost that

 i scrutinies 
seems too cheap to me men who have understanding should not 
just believe but should wrestle for knowledge to the best of their 
ability belief is not everythilg but neither is knowledge belief 
does not give us the security and the wealth of knowing desiring 
knowledge sometimes takes away too much belief both must 
strike a balance 
but it is also dangerous to believe too much because today 
everyone has to find his own way and encounters in himself a 
beyond full of strange and mighty things he could easily talce 
everything literally with too much belief and would be nothing 
but a lunatic the childishness of belief breaks down in the face 
of our present necessities we need differentiating knowledge 
to clear up the confusion which the discovery of the soul has 
brought in therefore it is perhaps much better to await better 
knowledge before one accepts things all too believingly 
from these considerations i spoke to my soul 
is all that to be accepted you know in what sense i ask this 
it is not stupid and unbelieving to ask thus but is doubting of a 
higher type 
to this she answered i understand youbut it is to be accepted 
to which i replied the solitude of this acceptance terrifies 
me i dread the madness that befalls the solitary 
she answered as you already know i have long predicted 
solitude for you you need not be afraid of madness what i 
predict is valid 
these words filled me with disquiet since i felt that i could 
almost not accept what my soul predicted because i did not 
understand it i always wanted to understand it with regard to 
myself therefore i said to my soul what misunderstood fear 
torments me 
that is your disbelie your doubt you do not want to believe 
in the size of the sacrifice that is required but it will go on to the 
bitter end greatness requires greatness you still want to be too 
cheap did i not speak to you of abandonment of leaving be 
do you want to have it better than other men 
no i replied no that is not it but i fear committing an 
injustice to men if i go my own way 
what do you want to avoid she said there is no avoidance 
you must go your way unconcerned about others no matter 
whether they are good or bad you have laid your hand on the 
divine which those have not 
i could not accept these words since i feared deception therefore 
i also did not want to accept this way that forced me into dialogue 
with my soul i preferred to speak with men but i felt compelled 
toward solitude and i feared at the same time the solitude of 
my thinking which departed from accustomed paths as i 
pondered this my soul spoke to me did i not predict dark 
solitude for you 
i know i answered but i did not really think that it would 
happen must it be so you can only say yes there is nothing to do other than for 
you to take care of your cause if anything should happen it can 
only happen on this way 
so it is hopeless i cried to resist solitude 
it is utterly hopeless you should be forced into your work 
as my soul spoke thus an old man with a white beard and a 
haggard face approached me i asked him what he wanted with 
me to which he replied 
i am a nameless one one of the many who lived and died 
in solitude the spirit of the times and the acknowledged truth 
required this from us look at meyou must learn this things 
have been too good for you  
but i replied is this another necessity in our so very dif
ferent time 
it is as true today as it was yesterday never forget that you 
are a man and therefore you must bleed for the goal of humanity 
practice solitude assiduously without grumbling so that everything 
will in time become ready you should become serious and hence 
take your leave from science there is too much childishness in it 
your way goes toward the depths science is too superficial mere 
language mere tools but you must set to work 
i did not know what work was mine since everything was dark 
and everything became heavy and doubtful and an endless sadness 
seized me and lasted for many days then one night i heard the 
voice of an old man he spoke slowly heavily and his sentences 
appeared to be disconnected and terribly absurd so that the fear 
of madness seized me again for he spoke the following words 
it is not yet the evening of days the worst comes last 
the hand that strikes first strikes best 
nonsense streams from the deepest wells amply like the nile 
morning is more beautiful than night 
flowers smell until they fade 
ripeness comes as late as possible in spring or else it misses 
its purpose 
these sentences that the old man spoke to me on the night of 
the  may of the year  appeared to me dreadfully meaningless 
i felt my i squirm in pain it moaned and wailed about the burden 
of the dead that rested on it it seemed as if it had to carry a 
thousand dead 
this sadness did not leave until the th june  in the 
night my soul spoke to me the greatest comes to the smallest 
after this nothing further was said and then the war broke out 
this opened my eyes about what i had experienced before and 
it also gave me the courage to say all of that which i have written 
in the earlier part of this book 
 from there on the voices of the depths remained silent 
for a whole year again in summer when i was out on the water 
alone i saw an osprey plunge down not far from me he seized a

large fish and rose up into the skies again clutching it i heard 
the voice of my soul and she spoke that is a sign that what is 
below is borne upward 
soon after this on an autumn night i heard the voice of an old 
man and this time i knew that it was ciliahmqn he said  
want to turn you around i want to master you i want to emboss 
you like a coin i want to do business with you one should buy 
and sell you you should pass from hand to hand selfwilling is 
not for you you are the will of the whole gold is no master out 
of its own will and yet it rules the whole despised and greedily 
demanded an inexorable ruler it lies and waits he who sees 
it longs for it it does not follow one around but lies silently 
with a brightly gleaming countenance selfsufficient a king 
that needs no proof of its power everyone seeks after it few 
find it but even the smallest piece is highly esteemed it neither 
gives nor squanders itself everyone takes it where he finds it 
and anxiously ensures that he doesnt lose the smallest part of 
it everyone denies that he depends on it and yet he secretly 
stretches out his hand longingly toward it must gold prove its 
necessity it is proven through the longing of men ask it who 
takes me he who takes it has it gold does not stir it sleeps 
and shines its brilliance confuses the senses without a word 
it promises everything that men deem desirable it ruins those 
to be ruined and helps those on the rise to ascend 
a blazing hoard is piled up it awaits the taker what 
tribulations do men not take upon themselves for the sake of 
gold it waits and does not shorten their tribulationsthe 
greater the tribulations the greater the trouble the more 
esteemed it is it grows from underground from the molten 
lava it slowly exudes hidden in veins and rocks man exerts all 
cunning to dig it out to raise it 
but i called out dismayed what ambiguous speech 
oh ciliahmqn 
but ciliahmqn continued not only to teach but also to 
disavow or why then did i teach if i do not teach i do not 
have to disavow but if i have taught i must disavow there
after for if i teach i must give others what they should have 
taken what he acquires is good but the gift that was not 
acquired is bad to waste oneself means to want to suppress 
many deceitfulness surrounds the giver because his own 
enterprise is deceitful he is forced to revoke his gift and to 
deny his virtue scrutinies i  
the burden of silence is not greater than the burden of my 
self that i would like to load onto you therefore i speak and i 
teach may the listener defend himself against my ruse by means 
of which i burden him 
the best truth is also such a skillful deception that i also 
entangle myself in it as long as i do not realize the worth of a 
successful ruse 
and i was startled again and cried oh ciliahmqn men have 
deceived themselves about you therefore you deceive them but 
he who fathoms you fathoms himself 
but ciliahmqn fell silent and retired into the shimmering 
cloud of uncertainty he left me to my thoughts and it occurred 
to me that high barriers would still need to be erected between 
men less to protect them against mutual burdens than against 
mutual virtues it seemed to me as if the socalled christian 
morality of our time made for mutual enchantment how 
can anyone bear the burden of the other if it is still the high
est that one can expect from a man that he at least bears his 
own burden 
but sin probably resides in enchantment if i accept self
forgetting virtue i make myself the selfish tyrant of the other 
and i am thus also forced to surrender myself again in order 
to make another my master which always leaves me with a bad 
impression and is not to the others advantage admittedly this 
interplay underpins society but the soul of the individual becomes 
damaged since man thus learns always to live from the other 
instead of from himself it appears to me that if one is capable 
one should not surrender oneself as that induces indeed even 
forces the other to do likewise but what happens if everyone 
surrenders themselves that would be folly 
not that it would be a beautiful or a pleasant thing to 
live with ones self but it serves the redemption of the self 
incidentally can one give oneself up with this one becomes 
ones own slave that is the opposite of accepting oneself if one 
becomes ones own slaveand this happens to everyone who 
surrenders himselfone is lived by the self one does not live 
ones self it lives itself 
the selfforgetting virtue is an unnatural alienation from ones 
own essence which is thus deprived of development it is a sin 
to deliberately alienate the other from his self by means of ones 
own virtuousness for example through saddling oneself with 
his burden this sin rebounds on us

 september  in late summer and autumn ofii jung conducted his correspondence with hans schmid on the question of psychological types his concluding 
letter to schmid of november  indicates a shift that signals a return to the elaboration of his fantasies in the black books understanding is a terribly binding power 
possibly a veritable soul murder when it levels out vitally important differences the core of the individual is a mystery of life which dies when it is grasped that is 
also why symbols want to keep their secrets they are mysterious not only because we are unable to clearly see what is at their bottom  all understanding as such being an 
integration into general viewpoints contains the devils element and kills  that is why in the later stages of analysis we must help the other to come to those hidden and 
unopenable symbols in which the seed of life lies securely hidden like the tender seed in the hard shell actually there must not be any understanding and agreement 
on this even if it were possible as it were but if understanding and agreement on this has become generalized and obviously possible the symbol is ripe for destruction 
because it no longer covers the seed which is about to outgrow the shell now i understand a dream i once had and which greatly impressed me i was standing in my 
garden and i had dug open a rich spring of water which gushed forth mightily then i had to dig a trench and a deep hole in which i collected all the water and let 
it flow back into the depths of the earth again in this way salvation is given to us in the unopenable and unsayable symbol for it protects us by preventing the devil

 i scrutinies 
it is submission enough amply enough if we subjugate 
ourselves to our self the work of redemption is always first to be 
done on ourselves if one dare utter such a great word this work 
cannot be done without love for ourselves must it be done at all 
certainly not if one can endure crgiven condition and does not feel 
in need of redemption the tiresome feeling of needing redemption 
can finally become too much for one then one seeks to rid oneself 
of it and thus enters into the work of redemption 
it appears to me that we benefit in particular from removing 
every sense of beauty from the thought of redemption and even 
need to do so or else we will deceive ourselves again because we 
like the word and because a beautiful shimmer spreads out over 
the thing through the great word but one can at least doubt 
whether the work of redemption is in itself a beautiful thing the 
romans did not find the hanged jew exactly tasteful and the 
gloomy excessive enthusiasm for catacombs around which cheap 
barbaric symbols gathered probably lacked a pleasant shimmer 
in their eyes given that their perverse curiosity for everything 
barbaric and subterranean had already been aroused 
i think it would be most correct and most decent to say that 
one blunders into the work of redemption unintentionally so to 
speak if one wants to avoid what appears to be the unbearable 
evil of an insurmountable feeling of needing redemption this 
step into the work of redemption is neither beautiful nor pleasant 
nor does it divulge an inviting appearance and the thing itself 
is so difficult and full of torment that one should count oneself 
as one of the sick and not as one of the overhealthy who seek to 
impart their abundance to others 
consequently we should also not use the other for our own 
supposed redemption the other is no stepping stone for our 
feet it is far better that we remain with ourselves the need for 
redemption rather expresses itself through an increased need 
for love with which we think we can make the other happy but 
meanwhile we are brimming with longing and desire to alter our 
own condition and we love others to this end if we had already 
achieved our purpose the other would leave us cold but it is true 
that we also need the other for our own redemption perhaps he 
will lend us his help voluntarily since we are in a state of sickness 
and helplessness our love for him is and should not be selfless 
that would be a lie for its goal is our own redemption selfless 
love is true only as long as the demand of the self can be pushed 
to one side but someday comes the turn of the self who would 
want to lend himself to such a self for love certainly only one 
who does not yet know what excess of bitterness injustice and 
poison the self of a man harbors who has forgotten his self and 
made a virtue of it 
in terms of the sel selfless love is a veritable sin 
we must presumably often go to ourselves to reestablish the 
connection with the sel since it is torn apart all too often not 
only by our vices but also by our virtues for vices as well as virtues 
always want to live outside but through constant outer life we 
 september   forget the self and through this we also become secretly selfish in 
our best endeavors what we neglect in ourselves blends itself 
secretly into our actions toward others 
through uniting with the self we reach the god 
i must say this not with reference to the opinions of the 
ancients or this or that authority but because i have experienced 
it it has happened thus in me and it certainly happened in a 
way that i neither expected nor wished for the experience of the 
god in this form was unexpected and unwanted i wish i could 
say it was a deception and only too willingly would i disown this 
experience but i cannot deny that it has seized me beyond all 
measure and steadily goes on working in me so if it is a deception 
then deception is my god moreover the god is in the deception 
and if this were already the greatest bitterness that could happen 
to me i would have to confess to this experience and recognize 
the god in it no insight or objection is so strong that it could 
surpass the strength of this experience and even if the god had 
revealed himself in a meaningless abomination i could only avow 
that i have experienced the god in it i even know that it is not 
too difficult to cite a theory that would sufficiently explain my 
experience and join it to the already known i could furnish this 
theory myself and be satisfied in intellectual terms and yet this 
theory would be unable to remove even the smallest part of the 
knowledge that i have experienced the god i recognize the god 
by the unshakeableness of the experience i cannot help but 
recognize him by the experience i do not want to believe it i do 
not need to believe it nor could i believe it how can one believe 
such my mind would need to be totally confused to believe such 
things given their nature they are most improbable not only 
improbable but also impossible for our understanding only a sick 
brain could produce such deceptions i am like those sick persons 
who have been overcome by delusion and sensory deception but 
i must say that the god makes us sick i experience the god in 
sickness a living god afflicts our reason like a sickness he fills 
the soul with intoxication he fills us with reeling chaos how 
many will the god break 
the god appears to us in a certain state of the soul therefore 
we reach the god through the self not the self is god although 
we reach the god through the self the god is behind the sel 
above the sel the self itsel when he appears but he appears as 
our sickness from which we must heal ourselves we must heal 
ourselves from the god since he is also our heaviest wound 
for in the first instance the gods power resides entirely in 
the sel since the self is completely in the god because we were 
not with the self we must draw the self to our side therefore 
we must wrestle with the god for the self since the god is an 
unfathomable powerful movement that sweeps away the self into 
the boundless into dissolution 
hence when the god appears to us we are at first powerless 
captivated divided sick poisoned with the strongest poison but 
drunk with the highest health 
 in  jung noted the integration or humanization of the self as has already been indicated is initiated from the conscious side by making ourselves conscious of 
our egotistical aims that means we give an account of our motives and try to form as objective a picture as possible of our own being transformation symbolism in 
the mass cw ii oo this corresponds to the process depicted here in the opening section of scrutinies 
 black book  continues which unites heaven and hell in itself p  cf jung transformation symbolism in the mass the self then functions as a unio oppositorum 
and thus constitutes the most immediate experience of the divine which is at all psychologically comprehensible  cw ii  
 in  jung wrote concerning the self but inasmuch as the i is only the centre of my field of consciousness it is not identical with the totality of my psyche being 
merely one complex among other complexes i therefore distinguish between the i and the self since the i is only the subject of my consciousness while the self is the 
subject of my total psyche which also includes the unconscious psychological types cw   in  jung described the process of individuation as selfbecoming 
and selfrealization the relations between the i and the unconscious cw   jung defined the self as the archetype of order and noted that representations of the 
self were indistinguishable from godimages ch  the self aion contributions to the symbolism of the self cw   in  he noted that he chose the term because 
this concept was on the one hand definite enough to convey the sum of human wholeness and on the other hand indefinite enough to express the indescribable and 
indeterminate nature of this wholeness  in scientific usage the self refers neither to christ nor to the buddha but to the totality of the figures that are its equivalent 
and each of these figures is a symbol of the self psychology and alchemy cw

yet we cannot remain in this state since all the powers of our 
body are consulned like fat in the flames hence we must strive to 
free the self from the god so that we can live 
it is certainly possible and even quite easy for our reason to 
deny the god and to speak only of sickness thus we accept the 
sickpart and can also heal it but it will be a healing with loss we 
lose a part of life we go on living but as ones lamed by the god 
where the fire blazed dead ashes lie 
i believe that we have the choice i preferred the living wonders 
of the god i daily weigh up my whole life and i continue to regard 
the fiery brilliance of the god as a higher and fuller life than the 
ashes of rationality the ashes are suicide to me i could perhaps 
put out the fire but i cannot deny to myself the experience of 
the god nor can i cut myself off from this experience i also do 
not want to since i want to live my life wants itself whole 
therefore i must serve my self i must win it in this way but i 
must win it so that my life will become whole for it seems to me 
to be sinful to deform life where there is yet the possibility to live 
it fully the service of the self is therefore divine service and the 
service of mankind if i carry myself i relieve mankind of myself 
and heal my self from the god 
i must free my self from the god since the god i experienced 
is more than love he is also hate he is more than beauty he is 
also the abomination he is more than wisdom he is also mean
inglessness he is more than power he is also powerlessness he 
is more than omnipresence he is also my creature 
in the following night i heard the voice of cdiahmqn again 
and he saido 
draw nearer enter into the grave of the god the place of 
your work should be in the vault the god should not live in you 
but you should live in the god 
these words disturbed me since i had thought before pre
cisely to free myself from the god but cdiahmqn advised me 
to enter even deeper into the god 
since the god has ascended to the upper realms cdiahmqn 
also has become different he first appeared to me as a magician 
who lived in a distant land but then i felt his nearness and since 
the god has ascended i knew that cdiahmqn had intoxicated 
me and given me a language that was foreign to me and of a differ
ent sensitivity all of this faded when the god arose and only 
cdiahmqn kept that language but i felt that he went on other 
ways than i did probably the most part of what i have written 
in the earlier part of this book was given to me by cdiahmnny 
consequently i was as if intoxicated but now i noticed that 
cdiahmqn assumed a form distinct from me 
  several weeks later three shades approached me i noticed 
from their chilly breath that they were dead the first figure was 
that of a woman she drew near and made a soft whirring sound scrutinies i  
the whirring of the wings of the sun beetle then i recognized 
her when she was still alive she recovered the mysteries of the 
egyptians for me the red sun disk and the song of the golden 
wings she remained shadowy and i could hardly understand her 
words she said 
it was night when i diedyou still live in the daythere 
are still days years ahead of you what will you beginlet me 
have the wordoh that you cannot hear how difficultgive 
me the word 
i answered dismayed i do not know the word that you seek 
but she cried the symbol the mediator we need the symbol 
we hunger for it make light for us 
wherefrom how can i i do not know the symbol that 
you demand 
but she insisted you can do it reach for it 
and precisely at this moment the sign was placed in my hand 
and i looked at it filled with boundless astonishment then she 
spoke loudly and joyfully to me 
that is it that is hap the symbol that we desired that we 
needed it is terribly simple initially stupid naturally godlike the 
gods other pole this is precisely the pole we needed 
why do you need hap i replied 
he is in the light the other god is in the night 
oh i answered whats that beloved the god of the spirit 
is in the night is that the son the son of the frogs woe betide 
us if he is the god of our day 
but the dead one spoke full of triumph 
he is the flesh spirit the blood spirit he is the extract of all 
bodily juices the spirit of the sperm and the entrails of the geni
tals of the head of the feet of the hands of the joints of the 
bones of the eyes and ears of the nerves and the brain he is the 
spirit of the sputum and of excretion 
are you of the devil i exclaimed full of horror where does 
my flashing godly light remain 
but she said your body remains with you my beloved your 
living body the enlightening thought comes from the body 
what thought are you talking about i recognize no such 
thought i said 
it crawls around like a worm like a serpent soon there soon 
here a blind newt of hell 
then i must be buried alive oh horror oh rottenness must i 
attach myself completely like a leech 
yes drink blood she said suck it up get your fill from the 
carcass there is juice inside certainly disgusting but nourishing 
you should not understand but suck 
damned horror no three times no i cried in outrage 
but she said it should not irritate you we need this meal 
the life juices of men since we want to share in your life thus 
we can draw closer to you we want to give you tidings of what 
you need to know 
 black book  continues the god has the power not the self powerlessness should thus not be deplored but it is the condition that should abide  the god acts from 
within himself this should be left to him what we do to the self we do to the god  if we twist the self we also twist the god it is divine service to serve oneself 
we thus relieve humanity of ourselves may one man carry anothers burden has become an immorality may each carry his own load that is the least that one can 
demand anyone to do we can at best show another how to carry his own load  to give all ones goods to the poor means to educate them to become idle  pity should 
not carry anothers load but it should be a strict educator instead solitude with ourselves has no end it has only just begun pp

 i scrutinies 
that is horribly absurdl what are you talking about 
but she looked at me as she had done on the day i had last 
seen her among the living and on which she showed me unaware 
of its meaning something of the mystery of what the egyptians had 
left behind and she said to me 
do it for me for us do you recall my legacy the red sun 
disk the golden wings and the wreath of life and duration 
immortality of this there are things to know 
the way that leads to this knowledge is hell 
from this i sank into gloomy brooding since i suspected the 
heaviness and incomprehension and the immeasurable solitude 
of this way and after a long struggle with all the weakness and 
cowardice in me i decided to talce upon myself this solitude of 
the holy error and the eternally valid truth 
and in the third night i called to my dead beloved and asked 
her 
teach me the knowledge of the worms and the crawling creatures 
open to me the darkness of the spirits 
she whispered give blood so that i may drink and gain 
speech were you lying when you said that you would leave the 
power to the son 
no i was not lying but i said something that i did 
not understand 
you are fortunate she said if you can say what you do not 
understand so listen hap is not the foundation but the 
summit of the church that still lies sunken we need this church 
since we can live in it with you and take part in your life you have 
excluded us to your own detriment  
tell me is hap for you the sign of the church in which you 
hope for community with the living speak why do you hesitate 
she moaned and whispered with a wealc voice give blood i 
need bloodo 
so take blood from my heart i spoke 
i thank you she said that is fullness of life the air of the 
shadow world is thin since we hover on the ocean of the air like 
birds above the sea many went beyond limits fluttering on 
indeterminate paths of outer space bumping at hazard into alien 
worlds but we we who are still near and incomplete would like to 
immerse ourselves in the sea of the air and return to earth to the 
living do you not have an animal form into which i can enter 
what i exclaimed horrified you would like to be my dog 
if possible yes she replied i would even like to be your dog 
to me you are of unspeakable worth all my hope that still clings 
to earth i would still like to see completed what i left too soon 
give me blood much blood 
so drink i said despairingly drink so that what should be 
will be 
she whispered with a hesitant voice brim i
i guess thats 
what you call herthe old onewhich is how it beginsthe one 
who bore the sonthe powerful hap who grew out of her shame 
and strove after the wife of heaven who arches over earth for 
brimo above and below envelops the son  she bears and raises 
him born from below he fertilizes the above since the wife is 
his mother and the mother is his wife 
 this paragraph is not in black book  
 december   
 this paragraph is not in black book  ccursed teaching is this still not enough of the horrifying 
mysterium i cried full of outrage and abhorrence 
if heaven becomes pregnant and can no longer hold its fruit 
it gives birth to a man who carries the burden of sinthat is the 
tree of life and of unending duration give me your blood listen 
this riddle is terrible when brimo the heavenly was pregnant 
she gave birth to the dragon first the afterbirth and then the son 
hap and the one who carried hap hap is the rebellion of the 
below but the bird comes from the above and places itself on the 
head of hap that is peace you are a vessel speak heaven pour 
out your rain you are a shell empty shells do not spill they catch 
may it stream in from all the winds let me tell you that another 
evening is approaching a day two days many days have come 
to an end the light of day goes down and illumines the shadow 
itself a shadow of the sun life becomes a shadow and the shadow 
enlivens itself the shadow that is greater than you do you think 
that your shadow is your son he is small at midday and fills the 
sky at midnight 
but i was exhausted and desperate and could hear no more 
and so i said to the dead one 
so you introduce the terrible son who lived beneath me 
under the trees on the water is he the spirit that the heavens 
pour out or is he the soulless worm that the earth bore oh 
heavenoh most sinister womb do you want to suck the life 
out of me for the sake of the shadow should humanity thus 
completely go to waste for divinity should i live with shadows 
instead of with the living should all the longing for the living 
belong to you the dead did you not have your time to live did 
you not use it should a living person give his life for your sake 
you who did not live the eternal speak you mute shadows who 
stand at my door and demand my blood 
the shadow of the dead one raised its voice and said you 
seeor do you still not see what the living do with your life 
they fritter it away but with me you live yourself since i belong 
to you i belong to your invisible following and community do 
you believe that the living see you they see only your shadow 
not youyou servant you bearer you vessel 
how you hold forth am i at your mercy should i no longer 
see the light of day should i become a shadow with a living 
body you are formless and beyond grasp and you emanate 
the coldness of the grave a breath of emptiness to let myself 
be buried alivewhat are you thinking of too soon it seems 
to me i must die first do you have the honey that pleases 
my heart and the fire that warms my hands what are you you 
mournful shadows you specters of children what do you want 
with my blood truly you are even worse than men men give 
little yet what do you give do you make the living the warm 
beauty or joy perhaps or should all this go to your gloomy 
hell what do you offer in return mysteries will the living live 
from these i regard your mysteries as tricks if the living cannot 
live from them 
but she interrupted me and cried impetuous one stop you 
take my breath away we are shadows become a shadow and you 
will grasp what we give

i do not want to die to descend into your darkness 
but she said you need not die you must only let yourself 
be buried 
in the hope of resurrection no joking now 
but she spoke calmly you suspect what will happen triple 
walls before you and invisibilityto hell with your longing and 
feeling at least you do not love us so we will cost you less dearly 
than the men who roll in your love and patience and have you 
malce a fool of yourself 
my dead one i thinlc you are spealcing my language 
she replied to me scornfully men loveand you what an 
error all this means is that you want to run away from your
self what do you do to men you tempt and coax them into 
megalomania to which you fall victim 
but it grieves me pains me howls at me i feel a great longing 
everything soft complains and my heart yearns 
but she was unsparing your heart belongs to us she said 
what do you want with men selfdefense against menso that 
you walk on your own two feet not on human crutches men need 
the undemanding but they are always wanting love to be able to 
run away from themselves this ought to stop why do fools go 
out and preach the gospel to the negroes and then ridicule it in 
their own country why do these hypocritical preachers speak of 
love divine and human love and use the same gospel to justify  
the right to wage war and commit murderous injustice above 
all what do they teach others when they themselves stand up to 
their necks in the black mud of deception and selfdeceit have 
they cleaned their own house have they recognized and driven 
out their own devil because they do none of this they preach 
love to be able to run away from themselves and to do to others 
what they should do to themselves but this greatly prized love 
given to ones own self burns like fire these hypocrites and liars 
have noticed thisas you haveand prefer to love others is 
that love it is false hypocrisy it always begins in yourself and 
in all things and above all with love do you believe that one who 
wounds himself unsparingly does the other a good deed with his 
love no of course you dont believe it you even know that he 
only teaches the other how one must wound oneself so that he 
can compel others to express sympathy therefore you should be 
a shadow since this is what men need how can they get away from 
the hypocrisy and foolishness of your love if you yourself cannot 
for everything begins with yourself but your horse still cannot 
refrain from whinnying even worse your virtue is a wagging dog 
a growling dog a licking dog a barking dogand you call that 
human love but love is to bear and endure oneself it begins with 
this it is truly about you you are not yet tempered other fires 
must yet come over you until you have accepted your solitude and 
learned to love 
what do you ask about love what is love to live above all 
that is more than love is war love you are bound to see what 
human love is still good enough fora means like other means 
therefore above all solitude until every softness toward yourself 
has been burnt out of you you should learn to freeze 
i see only graves before me i answered what cursed will is 
above me 
the will of the god that is stronger than you you slave you 
vessel you have fallen into the hands of the greater he knows scrutinies i  
no pity your christian shrouds have fallen the veils that blinded 
your eyes the god has become strong again the yoke of men is 
lighter than the yoke of the god therefore everyone seeks to yoke 
the other out of mercy but he who does not fall into the hands 
of men falls into those of the god may he be well and may woe 
betide him there is no escape 
is that freedom i cried 
the highest freedom only the god above you through 
yourself comfort yourself with this and that as well as you 
can the god bolts doors that you cannot open let your feelings 
whimper like puppies the ears on high are deaf 
but i answered is there no outrage for the sake of 
the human 
outrage i laugh at your outrage the god knows only 
power and creation he commands and you act your anxieties 
are laughable there is only one road the military road of 
the godhead 
the dead one spoke these unsparing words to me as i did 
not want to obey anyone i had to obey this voice and she spoke 
unsparing words about the power of the god i had to accept 
these words we have to greet a new light a bloodred sun 
a painful wonder no one forces me to only the foreign will 
in me commands and i cannot escape since i find no grounds 
to do so 
the sun appearing to me swam in a sea of blood and wailing 
therefore i said to the dead one 
should it be the sacrifice of joy 
but the dead one replied the sacrifice of all joy provided 
that you d it yourself joy should neither be made nor sought it 
should come if it must come i demand your service you should 
not serve your personal devil that leads to superfluous pain 
true joy is simple it comes and exists from itself and is not 
to be sought here and there at the risk of encountering black 
night you must devote yourself to me and seek no joy joy can 
never ever be prepared but exists of its own accord or exists 
not at all all you must do is fulfill your task nothing else joy 
comes from fulfillment but not from longing i have the power 
i command you obey 
i fear that you will destroy me 
but she answered i am life that destroys only the unfit 
therefore take care that you are no unapt tool you want to rule 
yourself you steer your ship onto the sand build your bridge 
stone upon stone but dont think of wanting to take the helm 
you go astray if you want to escape my service there is no 
salvation without me why are you dreaming and hesitating 
you see i answered that i am blind and do not know where 
to begin 
it always begins with the neighbor where is the church 
where is the community 
this is pure madness i cried out indignantly why do you 
speak of a church am i a prophet how can i claim such for 
myself i am just a man who is not entitled to know any better 
than others 
but she replied i want the church it is necessary for you and 
for others otherwise what are you going to do with those whom 
i force to your feet the beautiful and natural will nestle into the 
terrible and dark and will show the way the church is something 
 jung was critical of christian missionaries see the problems of the soul of modern men  cw io  
 black book  continues the dead one after the devil has preceded you now is not the time for love but for deeds i why do you mention deeds which deeds 
the dead one your work  what do you mean my work my science my book the dead one that is not your book that is the book science is what you 
do do it without hesitation there is no way back only forward your love belongs there ridiculousyour love you must allow death to occur  leave dead 
ones around me at least the dead one enough dead you are surrounded   do not notice anything the dead one you ought to notice them  how

 i scrutinies 
natural the holy ceremony must be dissolved and become 
spirit the bridge should lead out beyond humanity inviolable 
far of the air there is a community of spirits founded on outer 
 signs with a solid meaning 
listen i cried that doesnt bear thinking about its 
incomprehensible 
but she continued community with the dead is what both 
you and the dead need do not commingle with any of the dead 
but stand apart from them and give to each his due the dead 
demand your expiatory prayers 
and when she spoke these words she raised her voice and 
evoked the dead in my name 
you dead i call you 
you shades of the departed who have cast off the torment of 
living come here 
my blood the juice of my life will be your meal and your drink 
sustain yourself from me so that life and speech will 
be yours 
come you dark and restless ones i will refresh you with my 
blood the blood of a living one so that you will gain speech and 
life in me and through me 
the god forces me to address this prayer to you so that you 
come to life too long have we left you alone 
let us build the bond of community so that the living and the 
dead image will become one and the past will live on in the present 
our desire pulls us to the living world and we are lost in 
our desire 
come drink the living blood drink your fill so that we will 
be saved from the inextinguishable and unrelenting power of 
vivid longing for visible graspable and present being 
drink from our blood the desire that begets evil as quarrel 
discord ugliness violent deed and famishment 
take eat this is my body that lives for you take eat drink 
this is my blood whose desire flows for you 
come celebrate a last supper with me for your redemption 
and mine 
i need community with you so that i fall prey neither to the 
community of the living nor to my desire and yours whose envy 
is insatiable and therefore begets evil 
help me so that i do not forget that my desire is a sacrificial 
fire for you 
you are my community i live what i can live for the living but 
the excess of my longing belongs to you you shades we need to 
live with you 
be auspicious to us and open our closed spirit so that we 
become blessed with the redeeming light may it happen thus 
when the dead one had ended this prayer she turned to me 
again and said 
great is the need of the dead but the god needs no sacrificial 
prayer he has neither goodwill nor ill will he is kind and fearful 
though not actually so but only seems to you thus but the dead 
hear your prayers since they are still of human nature and not 
free of goodwill and ill will do you not understand the history 
of humanity is older and wiser than you was there a time when 
there were no dead vain deception only recently have men 
begun to forget the dead and to think that they have now begun 
the real life sending them into a frenzy 
 december   
 see note  p  
 january   this paragraph does not occur in black book   when the dead one had uttered all these words she 
disappeared i sank into gloominess and dull confusion when 
i looked up again i saw my soul in the upper realms hover
ing irradiated by the distant brilliance that streamed from the 
godhead and i called out 
you know what has taken place you see that it surpasses the 
power and understanding of a man but i accept it for your sake 
and mine to be crucified on the tree of life oh bitterness oh 
painful silence if it werent you my soul who touched the fiery 
heaven and the eternal fullness how could i 
i cast myself before human animalsoh most unmanly 
torment i must let my virtues my best ability be torn apart 
because they are still thorns in the side of the human animal 
not death for the sake of the best but befouling and rending of 
the most beautiful for the sake of life 
alas is there nowhere a salutary deception to protect me from 
having the last supper with my carcass the dead want to live 
from me 
why did you see me as the one to drink the cess of humanity 
that poured out of christendom havent you had enough of 
beholding the fiery fullness my soul do you still want to fly 
entire into the glaring white light of the godhead into what 
shades of horror are you plunging me is the devils pool so deep 
that its mud sullies even your glowing robe 
where do you get the right to do me such a foul deed let the 
beaker of disgusting filth pass from me but if this be not your 
will then climb past fiery heaven and lodge your charges and 
topple the throne of god the dreadful proclaim the right of men 
also before the gods and take revenge on them for the infamous 
deed of humanity since only gods are able to spur on the human 
worm to acts of colossal atrocity let my fate suffice and let men 
manage human destiny 
oh my mother humanity thrust the terrible worm of god 
the strangler of men from you do not venerate him for the sake 
of his terrible poisona drop sufficesand what is a drop to 
himwho at the same time is all emptiness and all fullness 
as i proclaimed these words i noticed that iiahmqn stood 
behind me and had given them to me he came alongside me 
invisibly and i felt the presence of the good and the beautiful 
and he spoke to me with a soft deep voice 
remove oh man the divine too from your soul as far as 
you can manage what a devilish farce she carries on with you as 
long as she still arrogates divine power over you shes an unruly 
child and a bloodthirsty daimon at the same time a tormentor of 
humans without equal precisely because she has divinity why 
where from because you venerate her the dead too want the 
same thing why dont they stay quiet because they have not 
crossed over to the other side why do they want sacrifice so 
they can live but why do they still want to live with men because 
they want to rule they have not come to an end with their craving 
for power since they died still lusting for power a child an old 
man an evil woman a spirit of the dead and a devil are beings 
who need to be humored fear the soul despise her love her just 
like the gods may they be far from us but above all never lose 
them because when lost they are as malicious as the serpent as 
bloodthirsty as the tiger that pounces on the unsuspecting from 
behind a man who goes astray becomes an animal a lost soul 
 in gethsamane christ said  my father if it be possible let this cup pass from me nevertheless not as i will but as thou wilt matthew

becomes a devil cling to the soul with love fear contempt and 
hate and dont let her out of your sight she is a hellishdivine 
treasure to be kept behind walls of iron and in the deepest 
vault she always wants to get out and scatter glittering beauty 
beware because you have already been betrayed youll never 
find a more disloyal more cunning and heinous woman than 
your soul how should i praise the miracle of her beauty and 
perfection does she not stand in the brilliance of immortal 
youth is her love not intoxicating wine and her wisdom the 
primordial cleverness of serpents 
shield men from her and her from men listen to what she 
wails and sings in prison but dont let her escape as she will 
immediately turn whore as her husband you are blessed through 
her and therefore cursed she belongs to the daimonic race 
of the tom thumbs and giants and is only distantly related to 
humankind if you seek to grasp her in human terms you will be 
beside yourself the excess of your rage your doubt and your love 
belong to her but only the excess if you give her this excess 
humanity will be saved from the nightmare for if you do not 
see your soul you see her in fellow men and this will drive you 
mad since this devilish mystery and hellish spook can hardly be 
seen through 
look at man the weal one in his wretchedness and torment 
whom the gods have singled out as their quarrytear to pieces 
the bloody veil that the lost soul has woven around man the 
cruel nets woven by the deathbringing and take hold of the 
divine whore who still cannot recover from her fall from grace 
and craves filth and power in raving blindness lock her up like 
a lecherous bitch who would like to mingle her blood with every 
dirty cur capture her may enough at last be enough let her for 
once taste your torment so that she will get to feel man and his 
hammer which he has wrested from the gods 
may man rule in the human world may his laws be valid but 
treat the souls daimons and gods in their way offering what 
is demanded but burden no man demand and expect nothing 
from him with what your devilsouls and godsouls lead you to 
believe but endure and remain silent and do piously what befits 
your kind you should act not on the other but on yoursel unless 
the other asks for your help or opinion do you understand what 
the other does neverhow should you does the other under
stand what you do whence do you take the right to think about 
the other and act on him you have neglected yoursel your 
garden is full of weeds and you want to teach your neighbor 
about order and provide evidence for his shortcomings 
why should you keep silent about the others because there 
would be plenty to discuss concerning your own daimons but 
if you act on and think about the other without him soliciting 
your opinion or advice you do so because you cannot distinguish 
yourself from your soul therefore you fall victim to her presumption 
and help her into whoring or do you believe that you must lend 
your human power to the soul or the gods or even that it will be 
useful and pious work if you want to bring the gods to bear 
on others blinded one that is christian presumptuousness the 
gods dont need your help you laughable idolater who seem to 
yourself like a god and want to form improve rebuke educate 
and create men are you perfect yourselftherefore remain 
silent mind your business and behold your inadequacy every day 
you are most in need of your own help you should keep your 
opinions and good advice ready for yourself and not run to 
others like a whore with understanding and the desire to help 
 in the poetic edda the giant thrym stole the hammer of the god thor scrutinies i  
you dont need to play god what are daimons who dont act out 
of themselves so let them go to work but not through you or else 
you yourself will become a daimon to others leave them to them
selves and dont preempt them with awkward love concern care 
advice and other presumptions otherwise you would be doing 
the work of the daimons you yourself would become a daimon 
and therefore go into a frenzy but the daimons are pleased at 
the raving of helpless men advising and striving to help others 
so stay quiet fulfill the cursed work of redemption on yoursel 
for then the daimons must torment themselves and in the same 
way all your fellow men who do not distinguish themselves from 
their souls and let themselves be mocked by daimons is it cruel 
to leave your blinded fellow human beings to their own devices 
it would be cruel if you could open their eyes but you could open 
their eyes only if they solicited your opinion and help yet if they 
do not they do not need your help if you force your help on 
them nonetheless you become their daimon and increase their 
blindness since you set a bad example draw the coat of patience 
and silence over your head sit down and leave the daimon to 
accomplish his work if he brings something about he will 
work wonders thus will you sit under fruitbearing trees 
know that the daimons would like to inflame you to embrace 
their work which is not yours and you fool you believe that it is 
you and that it is your work why because you cant distinguish 
yourself from your soul but you are distinct from her and you 
should not pursue whoring with other souls as if you yourself 
were a soul but instead you are a powerless man who needs all 
his force for his own completion why do you look to the other 
what you see in him lies neglected in yourself you should be 
the guard before the prison of your soul you aje your souls 
eunuch who protects her from gods and men or protects the 
gods and men from her power is given to the weak man a poison 
that paralyzes even the gods like a poison sting bestowed upon 
the little bee whose force is far inferior to yours your soul could 
seize this poison and thereby endanger even the gods so put the 
soul under wraps distinguish yourself from her since not only 
your fellow men but also the gods must live 
when lliahmqn had finished i turned to my soul who 
had come nearer from above during lliahmqns speech and spoke 
to her 
have you heard what lliahmqn has been saying how does 
this tone strike you is his advice good 
but she said do not mock or else you strike yourself do not 
forget to love me 
it is difficult for me to unite hate and love i replied 
i understand she said yet you know that it is the same hate 
and love mean the same to me like all women of my kind form 
matters less to me than that everything belong to me or else 
to no one i am also jealous of the hate you give others i want 
everything since i need everything for the great journey that 
i intend to begin after your disappearance i must prepare in 
good time until then i must make timely provision and much 
is still lacking  
and do you agree that i throw you into prison i asked 
of course she answered there i have peace and can collect 
myself your human world makes me drunkso much human 
bloodi could get intoxicated on it to the point of madness 
doors of iron walls of stone cold darkness and the rations of 
penancethat is the bliss of redemption you do not suspect my

and again into living matter from a dark fearful creative urge that 
formerly brought me close to the lifeless and ignited the terrible 
lust for procreation in me remove me from conceiving matter the 
rutting feminine of yawning emptiness force me into confinement 
where i can find resistance and my own law where i can think 
about the journey the rising sun the dead one spoke o and the 
buzzing melodious golden wings be thankfuldont you want to 
thank me you are blinded you deserve my highest thanks 
filled with delight at these words i cried 
how divinely beautiful you are and at the same time fury 
seized me 
oh bitterness you have dragged me through sheer and utter 
hell you have tormented me nearly to death and i long for 
your thanks yes i am moved that you thank me the hounds 
nature lies in my blood therefore i am bitterfor my sake since 
how does it move you you are divine and devilishly great 
wherever and howsoever you are as yet i am only your eunuch 
doorkeeper no less imprisoned than you speak you concubine 
of heaven you divine monster have i not fished you from 
the swamp how do you like the black hole speak without 
blood sing from your own force you have gorged yourself 
on men 
then my soul writhed and like a downtrodden worm turned 
and cried out pity have compassion 
compassion have you ever had compassion for me you 
brute bestial tormentor youve never gotten past compassionate 
moods you lived on human food and drank my blood has it 
made you fat will you learn to revere the torment of the human 
animal what would you souls and gods want without man 
why do you long for him speak whore 
she sobbed my speech stops im horrified at your accusation 
are you going to get serious are you going to have second 
thoughts are you going to learn modesty or perhaps even some 
other human virtue you soulless soulbeing yes you have no 
soul because you are the thing itself you fiend would you like a 
human soul should i perhaps become your earthly soul so that 
you will have a soul you see ive gone to your school ive learned 
how one behaves as a soul perfectly ambiguous mysteriously 
untruthful and hypocritical 
while i spoke to my soul in this way iiahmnn stood silently 
a little distance off but now he stepped forward laid his hand on 
my shoulder and spoke in my name 
you are blessed virgin soul praised be your name you are the 
chosen one among women you are the godbearer praise be to 
you honor and fame be yours in eternity 
you live in the golden temple the peoples come from afar 
and praise you 
we your vassals wait on your words 
we drinl red wine dispensing a sacrificial drink in recollection 
of the meal of blood that you celebrated with us 
we prepare a black chicken for a sacrificial meal in remembrance 
of the man who fed you 
we invite our friends to the sacrificial meal carrying wreaths 
of ivy and roses in remembrance of the farewell you took from 
your saddened vassals and maids 
let this day be a festival celebrating joy and lifethe day 
upon which you blessed one commence the return journey from 
the land of men where you have learned how to be a soul 
you follow the son who ascended and passed over 
 january ii  
 january   the preceding paragraph does not occur in black book  you carry us up as your soul and set yourself before the son of 
god maintaining your immortal right as an ensouled being 
we are joyful good things will follow you we lend you strength 
we are in the land of men and we are alive 
after iiahmnn had ended my soul looked saddened and 
pleased and hesitated and yet hurried to prepare herself to leave 
us and to ascend again happy at the regained freedom but i 
suspected something secret in her something that she sought to 
hide from me therefore i did not let her make off but spoke 
to her 
what holds you back what are you hiding probably a 
golden vessel a jewel that you have stolen from men isnt that 
a gem a piece of gold shining through your robe what is the 
beautiful thing that you robbed when you drank the blood of 
men and ate their sacred flesh speak the truth for i see the lie 
on your face 
i havent talen anything she answered annoyed 
you are lying you want to cast suspicion on me where you 
are lacking those times when you could rob men unpunished are 
over surrender everything that is his sacred inheritance and that 
you have rapaciously claimed you have stolen from the vassal and 
the beggar god is rich and powerful you can steal from him his 
kingdom knows no loss shameful liar when will you finally stop 
plaguing and robbing your humanity 
but she looked at me as innocently as a dove and said gently 
i do not suspect you i wish you well i respect your right i 
acknowledge your humanity i do not take anything away from 
you i do not withhold anything from you you possess everything 
i nothing 
yet i exclaimed you lie insufferably you possess not only 
that marvelous thing that belongs to me but you also have access to 
the gods and eternal fullness therefore surrender what you have 
stolen liar 
now she was vexed and replied 
how can you i no longer recognize you you are crazy even 
more you are laughable a childish ape who extends his paw 
toward everything that glitters but i will not allow what is mine 
to be taken from me 
then i cried enraged youre lying youre lying i saw the 
gold i saw the sparkling light of the jewel i know it belongs to 
me you ought not take that away from me give it back 
then she broke out in defiant tears and said i dont want to 
part with it its too precious to me do you want to rob me of the 
last ornament 
embellish yourself with the gold of the gods but not with 
the meager treasures of earthbound human beings may you 
taste heavenly poverty after you have preached earthly poverty 
and necessity to your humankind like a true and proper cleric 
full of lies who fills his belly and purse and preaches poverty 
you torment me awfully she wailed leave me just this one 
thing you men still have enough i cannot be without this very one 
this incomparable one for whose sake even the gods envy men 
i will not be unjust i replied but give me what belongs to 
me and beg for what you need from it what is it speak 
alas that i can neither keep it nor conceal it it is love warm 
human love blood warm red blood the holy source of life the 
unification of everything separated and longed for 
so i said it is love that you claim as a natural right and 
property although you still ought to beg for it you get drunk

on the blood of man and let him starve love belongs to me i 
want to love not you through me youll crawl and beg for it like 
a dog youll raise your hands and fawn like hungry hounds i 
possess the key i will be a more just administrator than you 
godless gods you will gather around the source of blood the 
sweet miracle and you will come bearing gifts so that you may 
receive what you need i protect the holy source so that no 
god can seize it for himself the gods know no measure and 
no mercy they get drunk on the most precious of draughts 
ambrosia and nectar are the flesh and blood of men truly a 
noble meal they waste the drink in drunkenness the goods 
of the poor since they have neither god nor soul presiding 
over them as their judges presumptuousness and excessive
ness severity and callousness are your essence greed for the 
sake of greed power for the sake of power pleasure for the salce 
of pleasure immoderation and insatiablness this is how one 
recognizes you you daimons 
yes you have yet to learn you devils and gods you daimons 
and souls to crawl in the dust for the sake of love so that from 
someone somewhere you snatch a drop of the living sweetness 
learn humility and pride from men for the sake of love 
you gods your first born son is man he bore a terribly 
beautifulugly son of god who is renewal to you all but this 
mystery too fulfills you you bore a son of men who is my renewal 
no less splendidterrible and his rule also will serve you 
then iahmqn approached me raised his hand and spoke 
both god and man are disappointed victims of deception 
blessedly blessed powerlessly powerful the eternally rich universe 
unfolds again in the earthly heaven and the heaven of the gods 
in the underworlds and in the worlds above separation once more 
comes to the agonizingly united and yoked endless multiplicity 
takes the place of what has been forced together since only 
diversity is wealth blood and harvest 
a night and a day passed and when night came again and 
i looked around i saw that my soul hesitated and waited so i 
addressed her  
what youre still here didnt you find the way or didnt 
you find the words which belong to me how do you honor 
humankind your earthly soul recall what i bore and suffered 
for you how i wasted mysel how i lay before you and writhed 
how i gave my blood to you i have an obligation to lay on you 
learn to honor humankind for i saw the land that is promised to 
man the land where milk and honey flows 
i saw the land of the promised love 
i saw the splendor of the sun on that land 
i saw the green forests the golden vineyards and the villages 
ofman 
i saw the towering mountains with hanging fields of 
eternal snow 
i saw the fruitfulness and fortune of the earth 
none but i saw the fortune of man 
you my soul force mortal men to labor and suffer for your 
salvation i demand that you do this for the earthly fortune of 
 in greek mythology ambrosia and nectar are the food and drink of the gods

build the furnace throw the old the broken the worn out the 
unused and the ruined into the melting pot so that it will be

 i did as my soul advised and formed in matter the thoughts

world for it is branded it bears a mark it beheld the forbidden 
therefore i avoid the ruler of this world 
but you should come before him she said he has heard about 
your fear 
you instilled this fear in me why did you give me away 
you have been summoned to serve him 
but i moaned and exclaimed thrice damned fate why cant 
you leave me in seclusion why has he chosen me for sacrifice 
thousands would gladly throw themselves before him why 
must it be me i cannot i dont want to 
but the soul said you possess the word that should not be 
allowed to remain concealed 
what is my word i answered it is the stammering of a minor 
it is my poverty and my incapacity my inability to do otherwise 
and you want to drag this before the ruler of this world 
but she looked straight into the distance and said i see the 
surface of the earth and smoke sweeps over ita sea of fire rolls

you announce what approaches you scale the mountains you go 
into every valley and stammer words of fright and proclaim the 
fires agony you bear the mark of the fire and men are horrified 
at you they do not see the fire they do not believe your words 
but they see your mark and unknowingly suspect you to be the 
messenger of the burning agony what fire they ask what fire you 
stutter you stammer what do you know about a fire i looked at 
the embers i saw the blazing flames may god save us

 january  ii 
 january  ii the preceding sentence does not occur in black book  with these words my soul vanished 
but i remained anxious and confused for many days and 
my soul remained silent and was not to be seen but one night 
a dark crowd knocked at my door and i trembled with fear 
then my soul appeared and said in haste they are here and 
will tear open your door 
so that the wicked herd can break into my garden should 
i be plundered and thrown out onto the street you make me 
into an ape and a childs plaything when oh my god shall 
i be saved from this hell of fools but i want to hack to pieces 
your cursed webs go to hell you fools what do you want 
with me 
but she interrupted me and said what are you talking about 
let the dark ones speak 
i retorted how can i trust you you work for yoursel not 
for me what good are you if you cant even protect me from the 
devils confusion 
be quiet she replied or else youll disturb the work 
and as she spoke these words behold iiahmqn came up to 
me dressed in the white robe of a priest and lay his hand on my 
shoulder then i said to the dark ones so speak you dead and 
immediately they cried in manyvoicesb we have come back from 
jerusalem where we did not find what we sought we implore 
you to let us in you have what we desire not your blood but your 
light that is it 
then iiahmqn lifted his voice and taught them sayingbo and 
this is the first sermon to the dead bl 
now hear i begin with nothingness nothingness is the same 
as the fullness in infinity full is as good as empty nothingness 
is empty and full you might just as well say anything else about 
nothingness for instance that it is white or black or that it does 
not exist or that it exists that which is endless and eternal has 
no qualities since it has all qualities 
 on the significance of the sermones that follow jung said to aniela jaffe that the discussions with the dead formed the prelude to what he would subsequently communicate 
to the world and that their content anticipated his later books from that time on the dead have become ever more distinct for me as the voices of the unanswered 
unresolved and unredeemed the questions he was required to answer did not come from the world around him but from the dead one element that astonished him 
was the fact that the dead appeared to know no more than they did when they died one would have assumed that they had attained greater knowledge since death 
this explained the tendency of the dead to encroach upon life and why in china important family events have to be reported to the ancestors he felt that the dead 
were waiting for the answers of the living mp pp  memories p  see note  p  above concerning christs preaching to the dead in hell 
 see above p  where the dead anabaptists led by ezechiel were heading to jerusalem to pray at th holy places 
 this sentence does not occur in black book  concerning the relation of philemon to the sermones jung told aniela jaffe that he grasped philemon in the sermones it 
was here that philemon lost his autonomy mp p  
 jungs calligraphic and printed versions of the sermones bear the subheading the seven instructions of the dead written by basilides in alexandria where the east 
touches the west translated from the original greek text into the german language basilides was a christian philosopher in alexandria in the first part of the second 
century little is known about his life and only fragments of his teachings have survived and none in his own hand which present a cosmogonic myth for the extant 
fragments and commentary see bentley layton ed the gnostic scriptures new york doubleday  pp i according to charles king basilides was by birth 
an egyptian before his conversion to christianity he followed the doctrines of oriental gnosis and endeavoured  to combine the tenets of the christian religion 
with the gnostic philosophy  for this purpose he chose expressions of his own invention and ingenious symbols the gnostics and their remains bell and daldy 
 pp  according to layton the classical gnostic myth has the following structure ct i the expansion of a solitary first principle god into a full non
physical spiritual universe act ii creation of the material universe including stars planets earth and hell act iii creation of adam eve and their children act 
ivsubsequent history of the human race the gnostic scriptures p  thus in its broadest outlines jungs sermones is presented in the form analogous to a gnostic 
myth jung discusses basilides in aion  he credits the gnostics for having found suitable symbolic expressions of the self and notes that basilides and valentinus 
allowed themselves to be influenced in a large measure by natural inner experience they therefore provide like the alchemists a veritable mine of information concerning 
all those symbols arising out of the repercussions of the christian message at the same time their ideas compensate the aysmmetry of god postulated by the doctrine of 
the privato boni exactly like those wellknown modern tendencies of the unconscious to produce symbols of totality for bridging the gap between consciousness and the 
unconscious cw   in  he wrote a letter to a friend from his student days rudolf lichtenhan who had written a book die offenbarung im gnosticismus 
 from lichtenhans reply dated november ii it appears that jung had asked for information concerning the conception of different human characters in 
gnosticism and their possible correlation with william jamess distinction between toughand tenderminded characters fa in memories jung said between 
 and  i had seriously studied the gnostics for they too had been confronted with the primal world of the unconscious they had dealt with its contents and 
images which were obviously contaminated with the world of drives p  jung was already reading gnostic literature in the course of the preparatory reading 
for transformations and symbols of the libido there has been an extensive body of commentaries concerning the septem sermones which provides some valuable discussion 
however these should be treated cautiously as they considered the sermones without the benefit of uber n ovus and the black books and not least philemons commentaries 
which together provide critical contextual clarification scholars have discussed jungs relation to gnosticism and the historical basilides other possible sources and 
parallels for sermones and the relation of the sermones to jungs later works see especially christine maillard les septem sermones aux morts de carl gustav jung nancy

we call this nothingness or fullness the pleroma therein 
both thinking and being cease since the eternal and endless 
possess no qualities no one is in it for he would then be distinct 
from the pleroma and would possess qualities that would 
distinguish him as something distinct from the pleroma 
in the pleroma there is nothing and everything it is fruitless 
to think about the pleroma for this would mean selfdissolution 
creation is not in the pleroma but in itself the pleroma is 
the beginning and end of creation  it pervades creation just as 
the sunlight pervades the air although the pleroma is altogether 
pervasive creation has no share in it just as a wholly trans
parent body becomes neither light nor dark through the light 
pervading it 
we are however the pleroma itsel for we are a part of the 
eternal and the endless but we have no share therein as we are 
infinitely removed from the pleroma not spatially or temporally 
but essentially since we are distinguished from the pleroma in our 
essence as creation which is confined within time and space 
yet because we are parts of the pleroma the pleroma is also 
in us even in the smallest point the pleroma is endless eternal 
and whole since small and great are qualities that are contained 
in it it is nothingness that is whole and continuous throughout 
only figuratively therefore do i speak of creation as part of 
the pleroma because actually the pleroma is nowhere divided 
since it is nothingness we are also the whole pleroma because 
figuratively the pleroma is the smallest point in us merely 
assumed not existing and the boundless firmament about us 
but why then do we speak of the pleroma at all if it is everything 
and nothing 
i speak about it in order to begin somewhere and also to free 
you from the delusion that somewhere without or within there 
is something fixed or in some way established from the outset 
every socalled fixed and certain thing is only relative that alone 
is fixed and certain that is subject to change 
creation however is subject to change therefore it alone 
is fixed and determined because it has qualities indeed it is 
quality itself 
thus we ask how did the creation come into being creatures 
came into being but not creation since creation is the very 
quality of the pleroma as much as noncreation eternal death 
creation is everpresent and so is death the pleroma has 
everything differentiation and nondifferentiation 
differentiation is creation it is differentiated differentiation 
is its essence and therefore it differentiates therefore man scrutinies i  
differentiates since his essence is differentiation therefore he also 
differentiates the qualities of the pleroma that do not exist he 
differentiates them on account of his own essence therefore he 
must speak of those qualities of the pleroma that do not exist 
you say what use is there in speaking about it at all 
did you yourself not say that it is not worth thinking about 
the pleroma 
i mentioned that to free you from the delusion that we are 
able to think about the pleroma when we distinguish the 
quali ties of the pleroma we are speaking from the ground of our 
own differentiated state and about our own differentiation but 
have effectively said nothing about the pleroma yet we need to 
speal about our own differentiation so that we may sufficiently 
differentiate ourselves our very nature is differentiation if 
we are not true to this nature we do not differentiate ourselves 
enough we must therefore make distinctions between qualities 
you ask what harm is there in not differentiating oneself 
if we do not differentiate we move beyond our essence beyond 
creation and we fall into nondifferentiation which is the other 
quality of the pleroma we fall into the pleroma itself and cease 
to be created beings we lapse into dissolution in nothingness 
this is the death of the creature therefore we die to the same 
extent that we do not differentiate hence the creatures essence 
strives toward differentiation and struggles against primeval 
perilous sameness this is called the principium individuationis 
this principle is the essence of the creature from this you can 
see why nondifferentiation and nondistinction pose a great 
danger to the creature 
we must therefore distinguish the qualities of the pleroma 
these qualities are pairs of opposites such as 
the effective and the ineffective 
the fullness and the emptiness 
the living and the dead 
the different and the same 
light and darkness 
hot and cold 
force and matter 
time and space 
good and evil 
the beautiful and the ugly 
the one and the many etc 
the pairs of opposites are the qualities of the pleroma that 
do not exist because they cancel themselves out as we are the 
 the pleroma or fullness is a term from gnosticism it played a central role in the valentinian system hans jonas states that pleroma is the standard term for the 
fully explicated manifold of divine characteristics whose standard number is thirty forming a hierarchy and together constituting the divine realm the gnostic religion 
the message ojthe alien god and the beginnings of christianity london routledge  p  in  jung said the gnostics  expressed it as pleroma a state of 
fullness where the pairs of opposites yea and nay day and night are together then when they become it is either day or night in the state of promise before they 
become they are nonexistent there is neither white nor black good nor bad dream analysis notes oj the seminar given in  ed william mcguire bollingen 
series princeton princeton university press  p  in his later writings jung used the term to designate a state of preexistence and potentiality identifying 
it with the tibetan bardo he must  accustom himself to the idea that time is a relative concept and needs to be compensated by the concept of a simultaneous 
bardoor pleromatic existence of all historical processes what exists in the pleroma as an eternal process appears in time as aperiodic sequence that is to say it is 
repeated many times in an irregular pattern answer toob  cw ii  see also        the distinction that jung draws between 
the pleroma and the creation has some points of contact with meister eckharts differentiation between the godhead and god jung commented on this in psychological 
types  cw  f the relation of jungs pleroma to eckhart is discussed by maillard op cit pp ii in  jung equated the pleroma with the alchemist 
gerhardus dorns notion of the unus mundus one world mysterium coniunctionis cw   jung adopted this expression to designate the transcendental postulate 
of the unity underlying the multiplicity of the empirical world ibid f 
 in psychological types  jung described tao as the creative being begetting as the father and bringing forth as the mother it is the beginning and end of all 
beings cw   the relation of jungs pleroma to the chinese tao is discussed by maillard op cit p  see also john peck the visio dorothei desert context 
imperial setting later alignments pp  
 lit unterschiedenheit cf psychological types  cw   differentiation drenzierung 
 the principiumindividuationis is a notion from the philosophy of arthur schopenhauer he defined space and time as the principium individuationis noting that he 
had borrowed the expression from scholasticism the principium individuationis was the possibility of multiplicity the world as will and representation   vols 
tr e j payne new york dover pp  the term was used by eduard von hartmann who saw its origin in the unconscious it designated the uniqueness of each 
individual set against the allone unconscious philosophie des unbewussten versuch einer weltanschauung berlin c dunker  p  in  jung wrote diversity 
arises from individuation this fact validates an essential part of schopenhauers and hartmanns philosophy in profound psychological terms transformations and symbols 
of the libido cw b  in a series of papers and presentations later in  jung developed his concept of individuation the structure of the unconscious cw  
and individuation and collectivity cw  in  jung defined it as follows the concept of individuation plays no minor role in our psychology individuation is 
in general the process of the formation and particularization of individual beings especially the development of the psychological individual as a being distinct from generality 
from collective psychology individuation therefore is a process of differentiation having for its goal the development of the individual personality psychological types

 i scrutinies 
pleroma itself we also have all these qualities in us since our 
nature is grounded in differentiation we have these qualities in 
the name and under the sign of differentiation which means 
first these qualities are differentiated and separate in us 
therefore they do not cancel each other out but are effective 
thus we are the victims of the pairs of opposites the pleroma is 
rent within us 
second these qualities belong to the pleroma and we must 
possess and live them only in the name and under the sign 
of differentiation we must differentiate ourselves from these 
qualities they cancel each other out in the pleroma but not in 
us distinction from them saves us 
when we strive for the good or the beautiful we forget our 
essence which is differentiation and we fall subject to the spell 
of the qualities of the pleroma which are the pairs of opposites 
we endeavor to attain the good and the beautiful yet at the same 
time we also seize the evil and the ugly since in the pleroma these 
are one with the good and the beautiful but if we remain true to 
our essence which is differentiation we differentiate ourselves 
from the good and the beautiful and hence from the evil and ugly 
and thus we do not fall under the spell of the pleroma namely 
into nothingness and dissolution 
you object you said that difference and sameness are also 
qualities of the pleroma what is it like if we strive for distinctive
ness are we in so doing not true to our own nature and must we 
nonetheless fall into sameness when we strive for distinctiveness 
you must not forget that the pleroma has no qualities 
we create these through thinking if therefore you strive for 
distinctiveness or sameness or any qualities whatsoever you 
pursue thoughts that flow to you out of the pleroma thoughts 
namely concerning the nonexisting qualities of the pleroma 
inasmuch as you run after these thoughts you fall again into the 
pleroma and attain distinctiveness and sameness at the same time 
not your thinking but your essence is differentiation therefore 
you must not strive for what you conceive as distinctiveness but 
for your own essence at bottom therefore there is only one striving 
namely the striving for ones own essence if you had this striving 
you would not need to know anything about the pleroma and its 
qualities and yet you would attain the right goal by virtue of your 
own essence since however thought alienates us from our 
essence i must teach you that knowledge with which you can 
bridle your thoughts 
the dead faded away grumbling and moaning and their 
cries died away in the distance 
but i turned to iiahmnn and said my father you utter 
strange teachings did not the ancients teach similar things 
and was it not a reprehensible heresy removed equally from 
love and the truth and why do you layout such a teaching 
to this horde which the night wind swirled up from the dark 
bloodfields of the west 
my son iiahmnn replied these dead ended their lives too 
early these were seekers and therefore still hover over their graves their lives were incomplete since they knew no way beyond the 
one to which belief had abandoned them but since no one teaches 
them i must do so that is what love demands since they wanted 
to hear even if they grumble but why do i impart this teaching 
of the ancients i teach in this way because their christian faith 
once discarded and persecuted precisely this teaching but they 
repudiated christian belief and hence were rejected by that faith 
they do not know this and therefore i must teach them so that 
their life may be fulfilled and they can enter into death 
but do you oh wise iiahmnn believe what you teach 
my son iiahmnn replied why do you raise this question 
how could i teach what i believe who would give me the right 
to such belief it is what i know how to say not because i believe 
it but because i know it if i knew better i would teach better 
but it would be easy for me to believe more yet should i teach a 
belief to those who have discarded belief and i ask you is it good 
to believe something even more if one does not know better 
but i retorted are you certain that things really are as you say 
to this iiahmnn answered i do not know whether it is the 
best that one can know but i know nothing better and therefore 
i am certain these things are as i say if they were otherwise i 
would say something else since i would know them to be otherwise 
but these things are as i know them since my knowledge is precisely 
these things themselves 
my father is that your guarantee that you are not mistaken 
there are no mistakes in these things iiahmnn replied there 
are only different levels of knowledge these things are as you know 
them only in your world are things always other than you know 
them and therefore there are only mistakes in your world 
after these words iiahmnn bent down and touched the earth 
with his hands and disappeared 
 that night iiahmnn stood beside me and the dead drew near 
and lined the walls and cried out we want to know about god 
where is god is god dead 
but iiahmnn rose and said and this is the second sermon 
to the dead 
god is not dead he is as alive as ever god is creation for 
he is something definite and therefore differentiated from the 
pleroma god is a quality of the pleroma and everything i have 
said about creation also applies to him 
but he is distinct from creation in that he is much more 
indefinite and indeterminable he is less differentiated than 
creation since the ground of his essence is effective fullness 
only insofar as he is definite and differentiated is he creation 
and as such he is the manifestation of the effective fullness of 
the pleroma 
everything that we do not differentiate falls into the pleroma 
and is cancelled out by its opposite if therefore we do not 
differentiate god effective fullness is canceled out for us 
moreover god is the pleroma itself just as each smallest 
point in the created and uncreated is the pleroma itself 
 the notion of life and nature being constituted by opposites and polarities featured centrally in the naturphilosophie of schelling the notion that psychic conflict took 
the form of a conflict of opposites and that healing represented their resolution featured prominently in jungs later work see psychological types  cw  ch  and

will we find him again  ibid he goes on to discuss the motif of the death and disappearance of god in connection with christs crucifixion and resurrection

effective emptiness is the essence of the devil god and devil 
are the first manifestations of nothingness which we call the 
pleroma it malces no difference whether the pleroma exists or 
not since it cancels itself out completely not so creation insofar 
as god and the devil are created beings they do not cancel each 
other out but stand one against the other as effective opposites 
we need no proof of their existence it is enough that we have to 
keep speaking about them even if both were not creation would 
forever distinguish them anew out of the pleroma on account of 
their distinct essences 
everything that differentiation takes out of the pleroma is a 
pair of opposites therefore the devil always belongs to god 
this inseparability is most intimate and as you know from 
experience as indissoluble in your life as the pleroma itsel since 
both stand very close to the pleroma in which all opposites are 
canceled out and united 
fullness and emptiness generation and destruction are what 
distinguish god and the devil effictiveness is common to both 
effectiveness joins them effectiveness therefore stands above 
both and is a god above god since it unites fullness and emptiness 
through its effectuality 
this is a god you knew nothing about because mankind 
forgot him we call him by his name abraxas  he is even more 
indefinite than god and the devil 
to distinguish him from god we call god hellos or sun 
abraxas is effect nothing stands opposed to him but the 
ineffective hence his effective nature unfolds itself freely the 
ineffective neither exists nor resists abraxas stands above the 
sun and above the devil he is improbable probability that which 
talces unreal effect if the pleroma had an essence abraxas would 
be its manifestation 
he is the effectual itsel not any particular effect but effect 
in general 
he talces unreal effect because he has no definite effect 
he is also creation since he is distinct from the pleroma 
the sun has a definite effect and so does the devil therefore 
they appear to us more effective than the indefinite abraxas 
he is force duration change 
the dead now raised a great tumult for they were christians 
but when iiahmqn had ended his speech one after 
another the dead also stepped back into the darkness once 
more and the noise of their outrage gradually died away in the 
distance when all the clamor had passed i turned to iiahmqn 
and exclaimed 
pity us wisest one you take from men the gods to whom they 
could pray you take alms from the beggar bread from the hungry 
fire from the freezing 
iiahmqn answered and said my son these dead have had to 
reject the belief of the christians and therefore they can pray to scrutinies i  
no god so should i teach them a god in whom they can believe 
and to whom they can pray that is precisely what they have 
rejected why did they reject it they had to reject it because 
they could not do otherwise and why did they have no other 
choice because the world without these men knowing it entered 
into that month of the great year where one should believe only 
what one knows that is difficult enough but it is also a remedy 
for the long sickness that arose from the fact that one believed 
what one did not know i teach them the god whom both i and 
they know of without being aware of him a god in whom one 
does not believe and to whom one does not pray but of whom 
one knows i teach this god to the dead since they desired entry 
and teaching but i do not teach him to living men since they 
did not desire my teaching why indeed should i teach them 
therefore i take away from them no kindly hearer of prayers 
their father in heaven what concern is my foolishness to the 
living the dead need salvation since they are a great waiting 
flock hovering over their graves and long for the knowledge that 
belief and the rejection of belief have breathed their last but 
whoever has fallen ill and is near death wants knowledge and he 
sacrifices pardon 
it appears i replied as if you teach a terrible and dreadful 
god beyond measure to whom good and evil and human suffering 
and joy are nothing 
my son said iiahmqn did you not see that these dead had a 
god of love and rejected him should i teach them a loving god 
they had to reject him after already having long since rejected 
the evil god whom they call the devil therefore they must know 
a god to whom everything created is nothing because he himself 
is the creator and everything created and the destruction of 
everything created have they not rejected a god who is a father 
a lover good and beautiful one whom they thought to have 
particular qualities and a particular being therefore i must teach 
a god to whom nothing can be attributed who has all qualities and 
therefore none because only i and they can know such a god 
but how oh my father can men unite in such a god does 
the knowledge of such a god not amount to destroying human 
bonds and every society based on the good and the beautiful 
iiahmnn answered these dead rejected the god of love 
of the good and the beautiful they had to reject him and so 
they rejected unity and community in love in the good and the 
beautiful and thus they killed one another and dissolved the 
community of men should i teach them the god who united 
them in love and whom they rejected therefore i teach them 
the god who dissolves unity who blasts everything human who 
powerfully creates and mightily destroys those whom love 
does not unite fear compels 
and as iiahmnn spoke these words he bent down swiftly to 
the ground touched it with his hand and disappeared 
 the following night the dead approached like fog from a 
swamp and exclaimed tell us more about the highest god 
 cf attempt at a psychological interpretation of the dogma of the trinity  cw ii f 
 in  jung commented on abraxas the gnostic symbol abraxas a madeup name meaning three hundred and sixtyfive  the gnostics used it as the name of 
their supreme deity he was a time god the philosophy of bergson la duree creatrice is an expression of the same idea jung described him in a way that echoes his 
description here just as this archetypal world of the collective unconscious is exceedingly paradoxical always yea and nay that figure of abraxas means the beginning 
and the end it is life and death therefore it is represented by a monstrous figure it is a monster because it is the life of vegetation in the course of one year the spring 
and the autumn the summer and the winter the yea and nay of nature so abraxas is really identical with the demiurgos the world creator and as such he is surely 
identical with the purusha or with shiva november  visions seminar vol  pp  jung added that abraxas is usually represented with the head of a fowl the 
body of a man and the tail of a serpent but there is also the lionheaded symbol with a dragons body the head crowned with the twelve rays alluding to the number 
of months june   visions seminar vol  p  according to st irenaeus basilides held that the ruler of them is named abrasaks and that is why this 
ruler has the number  within it layton ed the gnostic scriptures p  abraxas featured in albrecht dieterichs work abraxas studien zur religionsgeschichte des 
spiitern altertums jung studied this work closely early in i and his copy is annotated jung also had a copy of charles kings the gnostics and their remains london bell 
and daldy  and there are marginal annotations next to the passage discussing the etymology of abraxas on p

 i scrutinies 
and iiahmqn stepped forward and began to speak and this 
is the third sermon to the dead  
braxas is the god who is difficult to grasp his power is 
greatest because man does not see it from the sun he draws 
the summum bonum from the devil the infinum malum but from 
abraxas life altogether indefinite the mother of good and evilloo 
life seems to be smaller and weaker than the summum bonum 
therefore it is also hard to conceive that abraxass power transcends 
even the suns which is the radiant source of all vital force 
braxas is the sun and at the same time the eternally 
sucking gorge of emptiness of the diminisher and dismemberer 
of the devil 
the power of abraxas is twofold but you do not see it 
because in your eyes the warring opposites of this power are 
canceled out 
what the sun god speaks is life what the devil speaks is death 
but abraxas speaks that hallowed and accursed word that is 
at once life and death 
braxas produces truth and lying good and evil light and 
darkness in the same word and in the same act therefore abraxas 
is terrible 
he is as splendid as the lion in the instant he strikes down his 
victim he is as beautiful as a spring day 
he is the great and the small pan alike 
he is priapos 
he is the monster of the underworld a thousandarmed 
polyp a coiled knot of winged serpents frenzy 
he is the hermaphrodite of the earliest beginning 
he is the lord of toads and frogs which live in the water 
and go up on the land whose chorus ascends at noon and 
at midnight 
he is the fullness that seeks union with emptiness 
he is holy begetting 
he is love and its murder 
he is the saint and his betrayer 
he is the brightest light of day and the darkest night of madness 
to look upon him is blindness 
to recognize him is sickness 
to worship him is death 
to fear him is wisdom 
not to resist him is redemption 
god dwells behind the sun the devil behind the night what 
god brings forth out of the light the devil sucks into the night 
but abraxas is the world its becoming and its passing upon every 
gift that comes from the sun god the devil lays his curse 
everything that you request from the sun god produces a 
deed from the devil everything that you create with the sun 
god gives effective power to the devil 
 february  
 this sentence does not occur in black book  that is terrible abraxas 
he is the mightiest created being and in him creation is 
afraid of itself 
he is the manifest opposition of creation to the pleroma and 
its nothingness 
he is the sons horror of the mother 
he is the mothers love for the son 
he is the delight of the earth and the cruelty of the heavens 
at his sight mans face congeals 
before him there is no question and no reply 
he is the life of creation 
he is the effect of differentiation 
he is the love of man 
he is the speech of man 
he is the appearance and the shadow of man 
he is deceptive reality 
now the dead howled and raged for they were incomplete 
but when their noisy cries had faded away i said to iiahmqn 
how oh my father should i understand this god 
iiahmqn answered and said 
my son why do you want to understand him this god is to 
be known but not understood if you understand him then you 
can say that he is this or that and this and not that thus you hold 
him in the hollow of your hand and therefore your hand must 
throw him away the god whom i know is this and that and just 
as much this other and that other therefore no one can understand 
this god but it is possible to know him and therefore i speak 
and teach him 
but i retorted does this god not bring despairing confusion 
into the minds of men 
to this iiahmqn said these dead rejected the order of 
unity and community since they rejected the belief in the father 
in heaven who ruled with just measure they had to reject him 
therefore i teach them the chaos that is without measure and 
utterly boundless to which justice and injustice leniency and 
severity patience and anger love and hate are nothing for how 
can i teach anything other than the god whom i know and 
whom they know without being conscious of him 
i replied why oh solemn one do you call the eternally 
incomprehensible the cruel contradictoriness of nature god 
iiahmqn said how should i name it otherwise if the 
overpowering essence of events in the universe and in the hearts 
of men were law i would call it law yet it is also no law but 
chance irregularity sin error stupidity carelessness folly ille
gality therefore i cannot call it law you know that this must be 
so and at the same time you know that it did not have to be so 
and that at some other time it will not be so it is overpowering 
 aristotle defined happiness as the supreme good summum bonum in his summa theologica thomas aquinas identified this with god jung saw the doctrine of the 
summum bonum as being the source of the concept of the privatio boni which in his view had led to the denial of the reality of evil see aion  cw    and  
hence it is counterbalanced here with the infinum malum 
 in black book  see appendix c jung notes that abraxas is the god of the frogs and that the god of the frogs or toads the brainless one is the union of the 
christian god with satan see below p  in his later writings jung argued that the christian god image was onesided in that it left out the factor of evil 
throughstudying the historical transformations of godimages he attempted to correct this especially aion and answer to job in his note on how answer to job came 
to be written he wrote that in aion he had criticized the idea of the privatio boni as not agreeing with the psychological findings psychological experience shows us that 
whatever we call good is balanced by an equally substantial bad or evil if evil is nonexistent then whatever there is must needs be good dogmatically neither 
good nor evil can be derived from man since the evil one existed before man as one of the sons of god the idea of the privatio boni began to playa role in the 
church only after mani before this heresy clement of rome taught that god rules the world with a right and a left hand the right being christ the left being satan 
clements view is clearly monotheistic as it unites the opposites in one god later christianity however is dualistic inasmuch as it splits off one half of the opposites 
personified in satan  if christianity claims to be a monotheism it becomes unavoidable to assume the opposites as being contained in god  cw ii pp  
 in  jung noted the concept of an allencompassing god must necessarily include his opposite the coincidence of course must not be too radical otherwise 
god would cancel himself out the principle of the coincidence of opposites must therefore be completed by its opposite in order to attain full paradoxicality and 
hence psychological validity the spirit mercurius cw

and occurs as if from eternal law and at another time a slanting 
wind blows a speck of dust into the works and this void is a 
superior strength harder than a mountain of iron therefore you 
know that the eternal law is also no law so i cannot call it law 
but how else should it be named i know that human language 
has forever named the maternal womb of the incomprehensible 
god truly this god is and is not since from being and nonbeing 
everything emerged that was is and will be 
but when iiahmqn had spoken the last word he touched the 
earth with his hand and dissolved 
 the following night the dead came running sooner filling 
the place with their mutterings and said 
speak to us about gods and devils accursed one 
and iiahmqn appeared and began to speal and this is the 
fourth sermon to the dead  
the sun god is the highest good the devil the opposite thus 
you have two gods but there are many high and good things 
and many great evils among these are two devil gods one is the 
burning one the other the growing one 
the burning one is eros in the form of a flame it shines by 
consuming  
the growing one is the tree of life it greens by heaping up 
growing living matter 
eros flames up and dies but the tree of life grows with slow 
and constant increase through measureless periods of time 
good and evil unite in the flame 
good and evil unite in the growth of the tree in their divinity 
life and love stand opposed 
the number of gods and devils is as innumerable as the host 
of stars 
each star is a god and each space that a star fills is a devil but 
the empty fullness of the whole is the pleroma 
abraxas is the effect of the whole and only the ineffective 
opposes him 
four is the number of the principal gods as four is the number 
of the worlds measurements 
one is the beginning the sun god 
two is eros for he binds two together and spreads himself 
out in brightness 
three is the tree of life for it fills space with bodies 
four is the devil for he opens all that is closed he dissolves 
everything formed and physical he is the destroyer in whom 
everything becomes nothing 
happy am i who can recognize the multiplicity and diversity 
of the gods but woe unto you who replace this incompatible 
multiplicity with a single god in so doing you produce the 
i february   this sentence does not occur in black book  scrutinies i  
torment of incomprehension and mutilate the creation whose 
nature and aim is differentiation how can you be true to your own 
nature when you try to turn the many into one what you do unto 
the gods is done likewise unto you you all become equal and thus 
your naturelo is maimed 
equality prevails not for the sake of god but only for the sake 
of man for the gods are many while men are few the gods are 
mighty and endure their manifoldness like the stars they abide 
in solitude separated by vast distances therefore they dwell 
together and need communion so that they may bear their 
separateness for redemptions sake i teach you the reprehensible 
for whose salce i as rejected 
the multiplicity of the gods corresponds to the multiplicity 
of men 
numberless gods await the human state numberless gods 
have been men man shares in the nature of the gods he comes 
from the gods and goes unto the god 
thus just as it is no use to reflect upon the pleroma it is not 
worthwhile to worship the multiplicity of the gods least of all 
does it serve to worship the first god the effective fullness and 
the summum bonum by our prayer we can add nothing to it and 
take nothing from it because effective emptiness gulps down 
every thing  the bright gods form the heavenly world it is 
manifold and extends and increases infinitely the sun god is the 
supreme lord of the world 
the dark gods form the earthly world it is simple and 
diminishes and declines infinitely the devil is its nethermost 
lord the moon spirit satellite of the earth smaller colder and 
more dead than the earth 
there is no difference between the might of the heavenly 
and earthly gods the heavenly gods magnify the earthly gods 
diminish both directions are immeasurable 
here the dead interrupted iiahmqns speech with angry 
laughter and mocking shouts and as they withdrew their 
discord mockery and laughter faded into the distance i turned 
to iiahmqn and said to him 
oh iiahmnn i believe you are mistaken it seems that you 
teach a raw superstition which the fathers had successfully and 
gloriously overcome that polytheism which a mind produces only 
when it cannot free its gaze from the force of compulsive desire 
chained to sensory things 
my son iiahmnn replied these dead have rejected the 
single and highest god so how can i teach them about the one 
only and not multifarious god they must of course believe me 
but they have rejected their belief so i teach them the god that 
i know the multifarious and extended who is both the thing and 
its appearance and they also know him even if they are not 
conscious of him 
i in  jung wrote a chapter on the sexual theory in the psychology of the unconscious processes which presented a critique of the psychoanalytic understanding of 
the erotic in his  revision of this chapter retitled the eros theory he added the erotic   belongs on the one hand to the original drive nature of man    
on the other hand it is related to the highest forms of the spirit it only thrives when spirit and drive are in right harmony  eros is a mighty daemon as the wise 
diotima said to socrates  he is not all of nature within us though he is at least one of its essential aspects cw   in the symposium diotima teaches 
socrates about the nature of eros she tells him that he is a great spirit socrates everything classed as a spirit falls between god and human  what function do 
they have i asked  they interpret and carry messages from humans to gods and from gods to humans they convey prayers and sacrifices from humans and commands and 
gifts in return for sacrifices from gods being intermediate between the other two they fill the gap between them and enable the universe to form an interconnected 
whole they serve as the medium for all divination for priestly expertise in sacrifice ritual and spells and for all prophecy and sorcery gods do not make direct contact 
with humans they communicate and converse with humans whether awake or asleep entirely through the medium of spirits tr c gill london penguin  pp 
ea in memories jung reflected on the nature of eros describing it as a kosmogonos a creator and fathermother of all consciousness p  this cosmogonic 
characterization of eros needs to be distinguished from jungs use of the term to characterize womens consciousness see note  p

 i scrutinies 
these dead have given names to all beings the beings in the 
air on the earth and in the water they have weighed and counted 
things they have counted so and so many horses cows sheep 
trees segments of land and springs they said this is good for 
this purpose and that is good for that one what did they do 
with the admirable tree what happened to the sacred frog 
did they see his golden eye where is the atonement for the 
 cattle whose blood they spilled whose flesh they consumed 
did they do penance for the sacred ore that they dug up from 
the belly of the earth no they named weighed numbered and 
apportioned all things they did whatever pleased them and 
what did they do you saw the powerfulbut this is precisely 
how they gave power to things unknowingly yet the time has 
come when things speak the piece of flesh says how many men 
the piece of ore says how many men the ship says how many 
men the coal says how many men the house says how many 
men and things rise and number and weigh and apportion and 
devour millions of men 
your hand grasped the earth and tore off the halo and weighed 
and numbered the dones of things is not the one and only 
simpleminded god pulled down and thrown onto a heap the 
massed seeming of separate things dead and living yes this 
god taught you to weigh and number bones but the month of 
this god is drawing to a close a new month stands at the door 
therefore everything had to be as it is and hence everything must 
become different 
this is no polytheism that i have made up but many gods 
who powerfully raise their voices and tear humanity to bloody 
pieces so and so many men weighed numbered apportioned 
hacked and devoured therefore i speak of many gods as i spealc 
of many things since i know them why do i call them gods 
for the sake of their superiority do you know about this superior 
strength now is the time when you can learn 
these dead laugh at my foolishness but would they have raised 
a murderous hand against their brothers if they had atoned for 
the ox with the velvet eyes if they had done penance for the 
shiny ore if they had worshiped the holy treesi if they had 
made peace with the soul of the goldeneyed frog what say 
things dead and living who is greater man or the gods truly 
this sun has become a moon and no new sun has arisen from the 
contractions of the last hour of the night 
and when he had finished these words iialimqn bent down 
to the earth kissed it and said mother may your son be strong 
then he stood looked up at the heavens and said how dark is 
your place of the new light then he disappeared 
ro when the following night came the dead approached 
noisily pushing and shoving they were scoffing and exclaimed 
teach us fool about the church and holy communion 
but iiahmqn stepped before them and began to speakiii 
and this is the fifth sermon to the dead 
the world of the gods is made manifest in spirituality and 
in sexuality the celestial ones appear in spirituality the earthly 
in sexualityi spirituality conceives and embraces it is womanlike and 
therefore we call it mater coelestisi the celestial mother 
sexuality engenders and creates it is manlike and therefore we 
call it phallosi the earthly fatheri the sexuality of man is more 
earthly that of woman is more spiritual the spirituality of man 
is more heavenly it moves toward the greater 
the spirituality of woman is more earthly it moves toward 
the smaller 
mendacious and devilish is the spirituality of man and it 
moves toward the smaller 
mendacious and devilish is the spirituality of woman and it 
moves toward the greater 
each shall go to its own place 
man and woman become devils to each other if they do 
not separate their spiritual ways for the essence of creation 
is differentiation 
the sexuality of man goes toward the earthly the sexuality 
of woman goes toward the spiritual man and woman become 
devils to each other if they do not distinguish their sexuality 
man shall know the smaller woman the greater 
man shall differentiate himself both from spirituality and 
sexuality he shall call spirituality mother and set her between 
heaven and earth he shall call sexuality phallos and set him 
between himself and earth for the mother and the phallos are 
superhuman daimons that reveal the world of the gods they 
affect us more than the gods since they are closely akin to our 
essencei if you do not differentiate yourselves from sexuality 
and from spirituality and do not regard them as an essence both 
above and beyond you you are delivered over to them as qualities 
of the pleroma spirituality and sexuality are not your qualities 
not things you possess and encompass rather they possess and 
encompass you since they are powerful daimons manifestations 
of the gods and hence reach beyond you existing in themselves 
no man has a spirituality unto himself or a sexuality unto himself 
instead he stands under the law of spirituality and of sexuality 
therefore no one escapes these daimons you shall look upon 
them as daimons and as a common task and danger a common 
burden that life has laid upon you thus life too is for you a 
common task and danger as are the gods and first and foremost 
terrible abraxas 
man is weak and community is therefore indispensable if your 
community is not under the sign of the mother it is under the sign 
of the phallos absence of community is suffering and sickness 
community in everything is dismemberment and dissolution 
differentiation leads to singleness singleness is opposed 
to community but because of mans weakness with regard to 
the gods and daimons and their invincible law community 
is necessary not for mans salce but because of the gods the 
gods drive you to community insofar as the gods impose 
community upon you it is necessary more is bad 
in the community every man shall submit to others so that 
the community be maintained for you need it 
in singleness every man shall place himself above the other so 
that every man may come to himself and avoid slavery

iiwhen iiahmqn had finished the dead remained silent 
and did not move but looked at iiahmqn with expectation but 
when iiahmnn saw that the dead remained silent and waited he 
continued and this is the sixth sermon to the dead lib 
the daimon of sexuality approaches our soul as a serpent she 
is half human soul and is called thoughtdesire 
the daimon of spirituality descends into our soul as the 
white bird he is half human soul and is called desirethought 
the serpent is an earthly soul half daimonic a spirit and 
akin to the spirits of the dead thus too like these she swarms 
around in the things of earth making us fear them or else having 
them arouse our craving the serpent has a female nature forever 
seeking the company of those dead who are spellbound by the 
earth and who did not find a way across to singleness the 
serpent is a whore she courts the devil and evil spirits she is a 
mischievous tyrant and tormentor forever inveigling the most 
evil company the white bird is a halfcelestial soul of man he 
abides with the mother descending from time to time the bird 
is manlike and is effective thought he is chaste and solitary 
a messenger of the mother he flies high above the earth he 
commands singleness he brings knowledge from the distant 
ones who have departed before and attained perfection he 
bears our word up to the mother she intercedes she warns but 
she is powerless against the gods she is a vessel of the sun the 
serpent descends and cunningly lames the phallic daimon or 
else goads him on she bears up the toocrafty thoughts of the 
earthly those thoughts that creep through every hole and cleave 
to all things with craving although the serpent does not want to 
she must be of use to us she flees our grasp thus showing us the 
way which our human wits could not find 
iwhen iiahmqn had finished the dead looked on with 
 contempt and said cease this talk of gods and daimons and 
souls we have known this for a long time 
but iiahmqn smiled and replied you poor souls poor in 
flesh and rich in spirit the meat was fat and the spirit thin but 
how do you reach the eternal light you mock my stupidity which 
you too possess you mock yourselves knowledge frees one from 
danger but mockery is the other side of your belief is black less 
than white you rejected faith and retained mockery are you 
thus saved from faith no you bound yourselves to mockery and 
hence again to faith and therefore you are miserable 
but the dead were outraged and cried we are not miserable 
we are clever our thinking and feeling is as pure as clear water 
we praise our reason we mock superstition do you believe that 
your old folly reaches us a childish delusion has overcome you 
old one what good is it to us 
iiahmqn replied what can do you any good i free you 
from what still holds you to the shadow of life take this scrutinies i  
wisdom with you add this folly to your cleverness this unreason 
to your reason and you will find yourselves if you were men you 
would then begin your life and your lifes way between reason 
and unreason and live onward to the eternal light whose shadow 
you lived in advance but since you are dead this knowledge frees 
you from life and strips you of your greed for men and it also 
frees your self from the shrouds that the light and the shadow 
lay on you compassion with men will overcome you and from 
the stream you will reach solid ground you will step forth from 
the eternal whirl onto the unmoving stone of rest the circle that 
breaks flowing duration and the flame will die down 
i have fanned a glowing fire i have given the murderer a 
knife i have torn open healedover wounds i have quickened all 
movement i have given the madman more intoxicating drink 
i have made the cold colder the heat hotter falseness even 
falser goodness even better weakness even weaker 
this knowledge is the axe of the sacrificer 
but the dead cried your wisdom is foolishness and a curse you 
want to turn the wheel back it will tear you apart blinded one 
iiahmqn replied so this is what happened the earth 
became green and fruitful again from the blood of the sacrifice 
flowers sprouted the waves crash into the sand a silver cloud lies 
at the foot of the mountain a bird of the soul came to men the 
hoe sounds in the fields and the axe in the forests a wind rushes 
through the trees and the sun shimmers in the dew of the risen 
morning the planets behold the birth out of the earth climbed 
the manyarmed the stones speak and the grass whispers 
man found himsel and the gods wander through heaven the 
fullness gives birth to the golden drop the golden seed plumed 
and hovering 
the dead now fell silent and stared at iiahmqn and slowly 
crept away but iiahmqn bent down to the ground and said it 
is accomplished but not fulfilled fruit of the earth sprout rise 
upand heaven pour out the water of life 
then iiahmqn disappeared 
 was probably very confused when iiahmnn approached 
me the following night since i called to him saying what 
did you do oh iiahmqn what fires have you kindled 
what have you broken asunder does the wheel of creations 
stand still 
but he answered and said everything is running its usual 
course nothing has happened and yet a sweet and indescribable 
mystery has taken place i stepped out of the whirling circle 
whats that i exclaimed your words move my lips your 
voice sounds from my ears my eyes see you from within me truly 
you are a magician you stepped out of the whirling circle what 
confusion are you i am i you did i not feel as if the wheel of 
creation was standing still and yet you say that you have stepped 
out of the whirling circle i am truly bound to the wheeli feel 
the rushing swaying of itand yet the wheel of creation also 
stands still for me what did you do father teach me 
then iiahmqn said i stepped onto what is solid and took it 
with me and saved it from the wave surge from the cycle of births 
and from the revolving wheel of endless happening it has been 
stilled the dead have received the folly of the teaching they have 
been blinded by truth and see by mistake they have recognized felt

 i scrutinies 
and regretted it they will come again and will humbly inquire 
since what they rejected will be most valuable to them 
i wanted to question ctiahmqn since the riddle distressed 
me but he had already touched the earth and disappeared and 
the darkness of the night was silent and did not answer me and 
my soul stood silently shaking her head and did not know what 
to say about the mystery that ctiahmqn had indicated and not 
given away 
i another day passed and the seventh night fell 
and the dead came again this time with pitiful gestures and 
said we forgot to mention one thing that we would like you to 
teach us about men 
and iiahmnn stepped before me and began to speakl and 
this is the seventh sermon to the dead  
man is a gateway through which you pass from the outer 
world of gods daimons and souls into the inner world out of 
the greater into the smaller world small and inane is man already 
he is behind you and once again you find yourselves in endless 
space in the smaller or inner infinity 
at immeasurable distance a lonely star stands in the zenith 
this is the one god of this one man this is his world his 
pleroma his divinity 
in this world man is abraxas the creator and destroyer of his 
own world 
this star is the god and the goal of man 
this is his lone guiding god 
in him man goes to his rest 
toward him goes the long journey of the soul after death 
in him everything that man withdraws from the greater world 
shines resplendently 
to this one god man shall pray 
prayer increases the light of the star 
it throws a bridge across death 
it prepares life for the smaller world and assuages the hopeless 
desires of the greater 
when the greater world turns cold the star shines 
nothing stands between man and his one god so long as man 
can turn away his eyes from the flaming spectacle of abraxas 
man here god there 
weakness and nothingness here eternally creative power there 
 february  this sentence does not occur in black book  
 this sentence is not in black book  here nothing but darkness and clammy cold 
there total sun 
but when ctiahmnn had finished the dead remained silent 
heaviness fell from them and they ascended like smoke above 
the shepherds fire who watches over his flock by night 
but i turned to ctiahmqn and said illustrious one you teach 
that man is a gateway a gateway through which the procession of 
the gods passes through which the stream of life flows through 
which the entire future streams into the endlessness of the past 
ctiahmqn answered saying these dead believed in the 
transformation and development of man they were convinced 
of human nothingness and transitoriness nothing was clearer 
to them than this and yet they knew that man even creates its 
gods and so they knew that the gods were of no use therefore 
they had to learn what they did not know that man is a gateway 
through which crowds the train of the gods and the coming and 
passing of all times he does not do it does not create it does 
not suffer it since he is the being the sole being since he is the 
moment of the world the eternal moment whoever recognizes 
this stops being flame he becomes smoke and ashes he lasts 
and his transitoriness is over he has become someone who is 
you dreamed of the flame as if it were life but life is duration 
the flame dies away i carried that over i saved it from the fire 
that is the son of the fire flower you saw that in me i myself 
am of the eternal fire of light but i am the one who saved it for 
you the black and golden seed and its blue starlight you eternal 
beingwhat is length and brevity what is the moment and 
eternal duration you being are eternal in each moment what 
is time time is the fire that flares up consumes and dies down 
i saved being from time redeeming it from the fires of time and 
the darkness of time from gods and devils 
but i said to him illustrious one when will you give me the 
dark and golden treasure and its blue starlight 
iiahmnn replied when you have surrendered everything 
that wants to burn to the holy flame 
i and as ctiahmqn spoke these words a dark form with 
golden eyes approached me from the shadows of the night i 
was startled and cried are you an enemy who are you where 
do you come from i have never seen you before speak what do 
you want 
 on february   jung wrote a letter to joan corrie and commented on the sermones with particular reference to the last one the primordial creator of the 
world the blind creative libido becomes transformed in man through individuation  out of this process which is like pregnancy arises a divine child a reborn god 
no more longer dispersed into the millions of creatures but being one  this individual and at the same time all individuals the same in you as in me dr long 
has a little book vii sermones ad mortuous there you find the description of the creator dispersed into his creatures  in the last sermon you find the beginning of 
individuation out of which the divine child arises  the child is a new god actually born in many individuals but they dont know it he is a spiritual god a spirit 
in many people yet one and the same everywhere keep to your time and you will experience his qualities copied in constance longs diary countway library of

 in september  jung had conversations with his soul that provided further elaboration and clarification of the cosmology of the sermones september  soul 
how many lights do you want three or seven three is the heartfelt and modest seven the general and encompassing i what a question and what a decision i 
must be true i think i would like seven lights soul seven you say i thought so that has broad scopecold lights i i need cooling fresh air enough of this 
stifling mugginess too much fear and not enough free breathing give me seven lights soul the first light means the pleroma  the second means abraxas  
the third the sun  the fourth the moon  the fifth the earth  the sixth the phallus  the seventh the stars i why were there no birds and why were the 
celestial mother and the sky missing i they are all enclosed in the star as you look at the star you look through them they are the bridges to the star they 
form the seventh light the highest the floating which rises with flapping wings released from the embrace of the tree of light with six branches and one blossom in 
which the god of the star lay slumbering  the six lights are single and form a multiplicity the one light is one and forms a unity it is the blossoming crown of the tree 
the holy egg the seed of the world endowed with wings so it can reach its place the one gives rise to the many over and again and the many entails the one plack 
book  pp  september  soul now let us try this it is something of the golden bird it is not the white bird but the golden one it is different the white 
bird is a good daimon but the golden one is above you and under your god it flies ahead of you i see it in the blue ether flying toward the star it is something that is 
part of you and it is at once its own egg containing you do you feel me then ask i tell me more it makes me feel queasy soul the golden bird is no soul it 
is your entire nature people are golden birds as well not all some are worms and rot in the earth but many are also golden birds i continue i fear my revulsion 
tell me what you have grasped soul the golden bird sits in the tree of the six lights the tree grows out of abraxass head but abraxas grows out of the pleroma 
everything from which the tree grows blossoms as a light transformed as a womb of the flowering treetop of the golden eggbird the tree of light is first a plant 
which is called an individual this grows out of abraxass head his thought is one among many the individual is a mere plant without flowers and fruits a passageway 
to the tree of seven lights the individual is a precursor of the tree of light the lucent blossoms from him phanes himsel agni a new fire a golden bird this comes 
after the individual namely when it has been reunited with the world the world blossoms from it abraxas is the drive individual distinct from him but the tree of the 
seven lights is the symbol of the individual united with abraxas this is where phanes appears and he the golden bird flies ahead  you unite yourself with abraxas

the dark one answered saying i come from afar i come from 
the east and follow the shining fire that precedes me iiahmqn 
i am not your enemy i am a stranger to you my skin is dark and 
my eyes shine golden 
what do you bring i asked fearfully 
i bring abstinenceabstinence from human joy and suffering 
compassion leads to alienation pity but no compassionpity 
for the world and a will held in check toward the other 
pity remains misunderstood therefore it works 
far from longing know no fear 
far from love love the whole 
i looked at him fearfully and said why are you as dark as the 
earth of the fields and as black as iron im afraid of you such 
pain what have you done to me 
you may call me deathdeath that rose with the sun i come 
with quiet pain and long peace i lay the cover of protection on 
you in the midst of life begins death i lay cover upon cover 
upon you so that your warmth will never cease 
you bring grief and despair i answered i wanted to be 
among men 
but he said you will go to men as one veiled your light shines 
at night your solar nature departs from you and your stellar 
nature begins 
you are cruel i sighed 
the simple is cruel it does not unite with the manifold 
with these words the mysterious dark one vanished but 
iiahmqn regarded me with a serious and questioning look 
did you take a proper look at him my son he said you will 
be hearing from him but come now so that i can fulfill what the 
dark one prophesied for you 
as he spoke these words he touched my eyes and opened my 
gaze and showed me the immeasurable mystery and i looked for 
a long time until i could grasp it but what did i see i saw the 
night i saw the dark earth and above this the sky stood gleaming 
in the brilliance of countless stars and i saw that the sky had the 
form of a woman and sevenfold was her mantle of stars and it 
completely covered her 
and when i had beheld it iiahmqn said 
mother you who stand in the higher circle nameless one 
who shrouds me and him and protects me and him from the gods 
he wants to become your child 
may you accept his birth 
may you renew him i separate myself from him the cold 
is growing and its star blazes brighter 
he needs the bond of childhood 
you gave birth to the godly serpent you released it from the 
pangs of birth take this man to the abode of the sun he needs 
the mother scrutinies i  
a voice came from afar and was like a falling star 
i cannot take him as a child he must cleanse himself first 
iiahmqn saido what is his impurity 
but the voice said it is the commingling he contains human 
suffering and joy he shall remain secluded until abstinence is 
complete and he is freed from the commingling with men then 
shall he be taken as a child 
in this moment my vision ended and iiahmqn went away 
and i was alone and i remained apart as i had been told but 
in the fourth night i saw a strange form a man wearing a long 
coat and a turban his eyes shone cleverly and kindly like a wise 
doctors he approached me and said i speak to you of joy but 
i answered you want to speak to me of joy i bleed from the 
thousandfold wounds of men 
he replied i bring healing women taught me this art they 
know how to heal sick children do your wounds burn you healing 
is at hand give ear to good counsel and do not be incensed 
i retorted what do you want to tempt me mock me 
what are you thinking he interrupted i bring you the bliss 
of paradise the healing fire the love of women  
are you thinking i asked of the descent into the frog swamp 
the dissolution in the many the scattering the dismembering 
but as i spoke the old man turned into iiahmqn and 
i saw that he was the magician who was tempting me but 
iiahmqn continued 
you have not yet experienced the dismembering you should 
be blown apart and shredded and scattered to the winds men are 
preparing for the last supper with you 
what then will remain of me i cried 
nothing but your shadow you will be a river that pours 
forth over the lands it seeks every valley and streams toward 
the depths 
i asked full of grief but where will my uniqueness remain 
you will steal it from yoursel iiahmqn replied you 
will hold the invisible realm in trembling hands it lowers its 
roots into the gray darknesses and mysteries of the erth and 
sends up branches covered in leaves into the golden air 
animals live in its branches 
men camp in its shade 
their murmuring arises from below 
a thousandmileiong disappointment is the juice of the tree 
it will stay green for a long time 
silence abides in its treetop 
silence in its deep roots 
 gathered from iiahmqns words that  must remain true 
to love to cancel out the commingling that arises through unlived 
love i understood that the commingling is a bondage that takes 
the place of voluntary devotion scattering or dismembering arises 
light and phanes arises from you you have anticipated but not understood this at the time you had to separate from abraxas to become individual opposed to the 
drive now you become one with abraxas this happens through me you cannot do this therefore you must remain with me unification with the physical abraxas 
occurs through the human female but that with the spiritual abr occurs through me that is why you must be with me black book  pp ii

 i scrutinies 
as iiahmon had taught me from voluntary devotion it cancels 
out the commingling through voluntary devotion i removed 
binding ties therefore i had to remain true to love and devoted 
to it voluntarily i suffer the dismembering and thus attain bonding 
with the great mother that is the stellar nature liberation from 
bondage to men and things if i am bound to men and things i 
can neither go on with my life to its destination nor can i arrive at 
my very own and deepest nature nor can death begin in me as a 
new life since i can only fear death i must therefore remain true 
to love since how else can i arrive at the scattering and dissolution 
of bondage how else could i experience death other than through 
remaining true to love and willingly accepting the pain and all the 
suffering as long as i do not voluntarily devote myself to the 
dismembering a part of my self secretly remains with men and 
things and binds me to them and thus i must whether i want 
to or not be a part of them mixed in with them and bound to 
them only fidelity to love and voluntary devotion to love enable 
this binding and mixing to be dissolved and lead back to me that 
part of my self that secretly lay with men and things only thus 
does the light of the star grow only thus do i arrive at my stellar 
nature at my truest and innermost sel that simply and singly is 
it is difficult to remain true to love since love stands above 
all sins he who wants to remain true to love must also overcome 
sin nothing occurs more readily than failing to recognize 
that one is committing a sin overcoming sin for the sake 
of remaining true to love is difficult so difficult that my feet 
hesitated to advance 
when night fell iiahmon approached me in an earthcolored 
robe holding a silver fish look my son he said i was fishing 
and caught this fish i bring it to you so that you may be comforted 
and as i looked at him astonished and questioningly i saw that a 
shade stood in darkness at the door bearing a robe of grandeur  
his face was pale and blood had flowed into the furrows of his 
brow but iiahmon knelt down touched the earth and said to 
the shade my master and my brother praised be your name 
you did the greatest thing for us out of animals you made men 
you gave your life for men to enable their healing your spirit was 
with us through an endlessly long time and men still look to 
you and still ask you to take pity on them and beg for the mercy 
of god and the forgiveness of their sins through you you do 
not tire of giving to men i praise your divine patience are not 
men ungrateful does their craving know no limits do they still 
make demands on you they have received so much yet still they 
are beggars 
behold my master and my brother they do not love me but 
they long for you with greed for they also crave their neighbors 
possessions they do not love their neighbor but they want 
what is his if they were faithful to their love they would not be 
greedy but whoever gives attracts desire should they not learn 
love fidelity to love freely willed devotion but they demand 
and desire and beg from you and have learned no lesson from 
your aweinspiring life they have imitated it but they have not 
lived their own lives as you have lived yours your aweinspiring 
life shows how everyone would have to take their own life into 
their own hands faithful to their own essence and their own 
love have you not forgiven the adulteress did you not sit with

instead they pray to you and make demands on you and forever 
remind you that your work is incomplete yet your work would 
be completed if men managed to live their own lives without 
imitation men are still childish and forget gratitude since they 
cannot say thanks be to you our lord for the salvation you have 
brought us we have talcen it unto ourselves given it a place in our 
hearts and we have learned to carry on your work in ourselves on 
our own through your help we have grown mature in continuing 
the work of redemption in us thanlcs to you we have embraced 
your work we grasped your redemptive teaching we completed 
in ourselves what you had begun for us with bloody struggle we 
are not ungrateful children who desire our parents possessions 
thanks to you our master we will make the most of your talent 
and will not bury it in the earth and forever stretch out our 
hands helplessly and urge you to complete your work in us we 
want to take yur troubles and your work upon ourselves so that 
your work may be completed and so that you may lay your weary 
tired hands in your lap like the worker after a long days hard 
burden blessed is the dead one who rests from the completion 
of his work 
i wanted people to address you in this way but they have no 
love for you my master and brother they begrudge you the price 
of peace they leave your work incomplete eternally needing 
your pity and your care 
but my master and my brother i believe you have completed 
your work since the one who has given his life his entire truth 
all his love his entire soul has completed his work what one 
individual can do for men you have done and accomplished 
and fulfilled the time has come when each must do his own 
work of redemption mankind has grown older and a new month 
has begun  
when iiahmon had finished i looked up and saw that the 
place where the shade had stood was empty i turned to iiahmon 
and said my father you spoke of men i am a man forgive me 
but iiahmon dissolved into the darkness and i decided to do 
what was required of me i accepted all the joy and every torment 
of my nature and remained true to my love to suffer what comes to 
everyone in their own way and i stood alone and was afraid 
i on a night when everything was silent i heard a murmur 
like that of many voices and a bit more clearly i heard the voice 
of iiahmon and it was as if he were giving a speech and as i 
listened more closely i heard his words 
afterward when i had impregnated the dead body of the 
underworld and when it had given birth to the serpent of the 
god i went to men and saw the fullness of their affliction and 
their madness i saw that they were slaying each other and that 
they sought the grounds for their actions they did this because 
they did not have anything different or better to do but because 
they were accustomed to doing nothing for which they could 
not account they devised reasons that compelled them to go on 
killing stop you are out of your minds said the sage stop for 
heavens sake and take stock of what damage you have done

been conferred upon him overnight why do men not see their 
stupidity stupidity is a daughter of the god therefore men 
cannot stop murdering since thus they serve the serpent of the 
god without knowing it it is worth giving ones life for the sake 
of serving the serpent of the god hence be reconciled but it 
would be far better to live despite the god but the serpent of 
the god wants human blood this feeds it and makes it shine 
not wanting to murder and die amounts to deceiving the god 
whoever lives has become one who deceives the god whoever 
lives invents his life for himself but the serpent wants to be 
deceived out of hope for blood the greater the number of 
men who stole their lives from the gods the greater the harvest 
feeding the serpent from the bloodsown field the god grows 
strong through human murder the serpent grows hot and fiery 
through the drenching flood its fat burns in the blazing flame 
the flame becomes the light of men the first ray of a renewed 
sun he the first appearing light 
i could not grasp what else piahmqn said i spent a long 
time pondering his words which evidently he had spoken to 
the dead and i was horrified by the atrocities that attend the 
rebirth of a god 
 and soon afterward i saw elijah and salome in a dream 
elijah appeared concerned and alarmed therefore when in 
the following night that light was extinguished and every living 
sound fell still i called elijah and salome so that they would 
answer my questions elijah came forward and said 
i have become weak i am poor an excess of my power has gone 
to you my son you took too much from me you went too far 
away from me i heard strange and incomprehensible things and 
the peace of my depths became disturbed 
i asked but what did you hear what voice did you hear 
elijah answered i heard a voice full of confusion an alarmed 
voice full of warning and the incomprehensible 
what did it say i asked did you hear the words 
indistinctly it was confused and confusing the voice spoke 
first of a knife cutting something or perhaps harvesting perhaps 
the grapes that go to the wine press perhaps the one wearing 
the red robe treads the winepress from which the blood flows  
thereupon the voice spoke of gold that lies below and that kills 
whoever touches it then it mentioned fire thatburns terribly 
and that should flare up in our time and then there was a malicious 
word that i would rather not utter 
a malicious word what was it i asked 
he answered a word about the death of god there is only 
one god and god cannot die 
then i replied i am astonished elijah do you not know 
what happened do you not know that the world has put on a 
new garb that the one god has gone away and that in turn 
many gods and many daimons have come to man truly i am 
surprised i am extremely surprised how could you not have 
known know you nothing of the new that has come to pass yet 
you know the future you have foresight or maybe you should 
not know what is do you ultimately deny what is 
 may   
 see above p  
 see above p  scrutinies i  
salome interrupted me what is gives no pleasure pleasure 
comes only from the new your soul would also like a new 
husbandha halshe loves change you are not pleasurable 
enough for her in that respect she is unteachable and therefore 
you believe she is mad we love only what is coming not what 
is only the new gives us pleasure elijah does not think about 
what is only about what is to come therefore he knows it 
i answered what does he know he should say 
elijah said i have already uttered the words the image that 
i saw was crimson fiery colored a gleaming gold the voice that 
i heard was like distant thunder like the wind roaring in the 
forest like an earthquake it was not the voice of my god but it 
was a thunderous pagan roar a call my ancestors knew but which 
i have never heard it sounded prehistoric as if from a forest on 
a distant coast it rang with all the voices of the wilderness it 
was full of horror yet harmonic 
to this i replied my good old man you heard correctly as i 
thought you had how wonderful shall i tell you about it after 
all i told you that the world has acquired a new face a new cover 
was thrown over it how odd that you dont know 
old gods have become new the one god is deadyes truly 
he died he disintegrated into the many and thus the world became 
rich overnight and something also happened to the individual 
soulwho would care to describe it but therefore men too became 
rich overnight how is it possible that you didnt know this 
the one god became two a multiple one whose body consists 
of many gods and a single one whose body is a man and yet he is 
brighter and stronger than the sun 
what shall i tell you about the soul havent you noticed 
that she has become multiple she has become the closest near
est near far further furthest and yet she is one as before first 
she divided herself into a serpent and a bird then into a father 
and mother and then into elijah and salome how are you my 
good fellow does it disturb you yes you must be realizing that 
you are already very far removed from me so that i can hardly 
recleon you as being part of my soul since if you belonged to 
my soul you would have to know what is happening therefore 
i must separate you and salome from my soul and place you 
among the daimons you are connected to what is primordially 
old and always exists therefore you also know nothing of the 
being of men but simply of the past and future 
nevertheless it is good that you came to my call take part in 
that which is for what is ought to be such that you can take part 
in it 
but elijah sullenly replied i do not like this multiplicity it is 
not easy to think it 
and salome said the simple alone is pleasurable one need 
not think about it  
i replied elijah you need not contemplate it at all it is not to 
be thought it is to be viewed it is a painting 
and to salome i said salome it is not true that only the simple 
is pleasurable over time it is even boring in truth the multiple 
captivates you 
 in memories jung stated the figures of the unconscious are also uninformed and need man or contact with consciousness in order to attain to knowledge when 
i began working with the unconscious i found myself much involved with the figures of salome and elijah then they receded but after about two years they reap
peared to my complete astonishment they were completely unchanged they spoke and acted as if nothing had happened in the meanwhile in actuality the most 
incredible things had talcen place in my life i had as it were to begin from the beginning again to tell them all about what had been going on and explain things 
to them at the time i had been greatly surprised by this situation only later did i understand what had happened in the interval the two had sunk back into the 
unconscious and into themselves i might equally put into timelessness they remained out of contact with the i and the is changing circumstances and therefore 
were ignorant of what had happened in the world of consciousness pp  this appears to refer to this conversation

 i scrutinies 
but salome turned to elijah and said father it seems to me that 
men have outstripped us he is right the many is more pleasurable 
the one is too simple and always the same 
elijah seemed saddened and said what about the one in this 
case does the one still exist if it stands next to the many 
i answered that is your old and ingrained mistake that the 
one excludes the many but there are many individual things the 
multiplicity of individual things is the one multiple god from 
whose bodymany gods arise but the uniqueness of the one thing 
is the other god whose body is a man but whose spirit is as large 
as the world 
but elijah shook his head and said that is new my son is the 
new good what was is good and what was will be is that not the 
truth has there ever been anything new and was what you call 
new ever good everything remains the same if you give it a new 
name there is nothing new there can be nothing new how could 
i then look ahead i look at the past and therein i see the future 
as in a mirror and i see that nothing new happens everything is 
but mere recurrence of what has been since time immemorial 
what is your being an appearance a darting light tomorrow it 
is no longer true it is gone it is as if it never was come salome 
let us go one is mistaken in the world of men 
but salome looked back and whispered to me while leaving 
being and multiplicity appeal to me even if it is not new and not 
eternally true 
thus they disappeared into the dark night and i returned to 
the burden signified by my existence and i sought to do every
thing correctly that seemed to me to be a task and to take every 
way that seemed to me to be necessary for myself but my dreams 
became difficult and laden with anxiety and i did not know why 
one night my soul suddenly came to me as if worried and said 
listen to me i am in a great torment the son of the dark womb 
besieges me therefore your dreams are also difficult since you 
feel the torment of the depths the pain of your soul and the 
suffering of the gods 
i answered can i help or is it superfluous that a man 
elevates himself to being a mediator of the gods is it presumption 
or should a man become a redeemer of the gods after men are 
saved through the divine mediator 
you speal the truth my soul replied the gods need a human 
mediator and rescuer with this man paves the way to crossing 
over and to divinity i gave you a frightening dream so that your 
face would turn to the gods i let their torment reach you so that 
you would remember the suffering gods you do too much for 
men since they are the masters of your world you can in effect 
help men only through the gods not directly alleviate the burning 
torment of the gods 
i asked her so tell me where do i begin i feel their torment and 
mine at the same time and yet it is not mine both real and unreal 
that is it and this is where separation should occur my 
soul replied 
but how my wits fail me you must know how 
your wits fail quicldy she retorted but the gods need 
precisely your human wits 
and i the wits of the gods i added and thus we run aground 
no you are too impatient only patient comparison provides a 
solution not one side taking a quick decision it requires work 
i asked what do the gods suffer from 
well my soul replied you have left them with torment and 
since then they have suffered 
 the rest of this dialogue does not occur in black book  
 see note  p ii 
 may   rightly so i cried they have tormented men enough now 
they should get a taste of it 
she answered but what if the torment also reaches you 
what have you gained then you cannot leave all suffering to the 
gods or else they will draw you into their torment after all they 
possess the power to do so to be sure i must confess that men 
too possess a wondrous power over the gods through their wits 
i answered i recognize that the torment of the gods reached 
me therefore i also recognize that i must yield to the gods what 
is their desire 
they want obedience she replied 
so be it i answered but i fear their desire therefore i say 
i want to do what i can on no account will i take back onto 
myself all the torment that i had to leave to the gods not even 
christ took torment away from his followers but rather he heaped 
it on i reserve conditions for myself the gods should recognize 
this and direct their desire accordingly there is no longer any 
unconditional obedience since man has stopped being a slave to 
the gods he has dignity before the gods he is a limb that even 
the gods cannot do without giving way before the gods is no 
more so let their wish be heard comparison shall accomplish 
the rest so that each will have his appropriate part 
my soul answered the gods want you to do for their sake 
what you know you do not want to do 
i thought so i exclaimed of course that is what the gods 
want but do the gods also do what i want i want the fruits of 
my labor what do the gods do for me they want their goals to 
be fulfilled but what about mine 
this infuriated my soul and she said you are unbelievably 
defiant and rebellious consider the fact that the gods are strong 
i know i replied but no longer is there any unconditional 
obedience when will they use their strength for me they also 
want me to place mine in their service what is their payment in 
kind that they are tormented man suffered agony and the gods 
were still not satisfied but remained insatiable in their devising of 
new torments they allowed man to become so blinded that 
he believed that there were no gods and that there was only 
one god who was a loving father so that today someone who 
struggles with the gods is even thought to be crazy they have 
thus prepared this shame too for those who recognize them out 
of boundless greed for power since leading the blind is not easy 
they will corrupt even their slaves 
you do not want to obey the gods my soul cried astonished 
i answered i believe that has already gone on more than 
enough hence the gods are insatiable because they have 
received too many sacrifices the altars of blinded humanity 
are streaming with blood but dearth makes contentment not 
abundance may they learn dearth from men who does some
thing for me that is the question that i must pose in no case 
will i do what the gods would have to do ask the gods what 
they think of my suggestion 
then my soul divided herself as a bird she swooped up to the 
higher gods and as a serpent she crawled down to the lower gods 
soon afterward she returned and said troubled the gods are 
outraged that you do not want to be obedient 
that bothers me very little i replied i have done everything 
to placate the gods may they do their share now tell them i can 
wait i will let no one tell me what to do the gods may devise a 
service in return you can go i will call you tomorrow so that you 
can tell me what the gods have decided

as my soul departed i saw that she was shocked and worried 
since she belonged to the race of the gods and daimons and 
forever sought to convert me to their kind as my humanity would 
like to convince me that i belong to the clan and must serve it 
when i was asleep my soul came again and in a dream cunningly 
painted me as a horned devil to terrify me and make me afraid of 
myself in the following night however i called my soul and said 
to her your trick was recognized it is to no avail you do not 
frighten me now speak and convey your message 
she answered the gods give in you have broken the 
compulsion of the law therefore i painted you as a devil since he 
is the only one among the gods who bows to no compulsion he 
is the rebel against the eternal law to which thanks to his deed 
there are also exceptions thus one does not necessarily have 
to the devil is helpful in this respect but it should not happen 
without seeking counsel from the gods this detour is necessary 
or else you will fall prey to their law despite the devil 
here the soul drew near to my ear and whispered the gods 
are even happy to turn a blind eye from time to time since 
basically they know very well that it would be bad for life if 
there were no exception to eternal law hence their tolerance of 
the devi 
she then raised her voice and cried loudly the gods have 
mercy upon you and have accepted your sacrifice 
and so the devil helped me to cleanse myself from commingling 
in bondage and the pain of onesidedness pierced my heart and 
the wound of being torn apart scorched me 
i ist was noon on a hot summers day and i was taldng 
a stroll in my garden when i reached the shade of the high 
trees i met iiahmqn strolling in the fragrant grass but when 
i sought to approach him a blue shadeis came from the other 
side and when iiahmqn saw him he said i find you in the 
garden beloved the sins of the world have conferred beauty 
upon your countenance 
the suffering of the world has straightened your shape 
you are truly a king 
your crimson is blood 
your ermine is snow from the coldness of the poles 
your crown is the heavenly body of the sun which you bear 
on your head 
 june i  scrutinies i  
welcome to the garden my master my beloved my brother 
the shade replied oh simon magus or whatever your name 
may be are you in my garden or am i in yoursis 
iiahmqn said you are oh master in my garden helena or 
whatever you choose to call her and i are your servants you can 
find accommodation with us simon and helena have become 
iiahmqn and bauds and so we are the hosts of the gods we 
granted hospitality to your terrible worm and since you come 
forward we take you in it is our garden that surrounds youiss 
the shade answered is this garden not mine is not the 
world of the heavens and of the spirits my own 
iiahmon said you are oh master here in the world of 
men men have changed they are no longer the slaves and 
no longer the swindlers of the gods and no longer mourn in 
your name but they grant hospitality to the gods the terrible 
wormis came before you whom you recognize as your brother 
insofar as you are of divine nature and as your father insofar as 
you are of human natureis you dismissed him when he gave you 
clever counsel in the desert you took the counsel but dismissed 
the worm he finds a place with us but where he is you will be 
also iss when i was simon i sought to escape him with the ploy 
of magic and thus i escaped you now that i gave the worm a 
place in my garden you come to me 
the shade answered do i fall for the power of your trick 
have you secretly caught me were not deception and lies always 
your manner 
but iiahmon answered recognize oh master and beloved 
that your nature is also of the serpentis were you not raised on 
the tree like the serpent have you laid aside your body like the 
serpent its skin have you not practiced the healing arts like the 
serpent did you not go to hell before your ascent and did you 
not see your brother there who was shut away in the abyssi 
then the shade said you speak the truth you are not lying 
even so do you know what i bring you 
this i know not iiahmon answered i know only one 
thing that whoever hosts the worm also needs his brother 
what do you bring me my beautiful guest lamentation 
and abomination were the gift of the worm what will you 
give us 
the shade answered i bring you the beauty of suffering that 
is wha is needed by whoever hosts the worm 
 in black book  the shade is identified as christ p  
 simon magus first century was a magician in the acts of the apostles  after becoming a christian he wished to purchase the power of transmitting the 
holy spirit from peter and paul jung saw this account as a caricature further accounts of him are found in the apocryphal acts of peter and in writings of the 
church fathers he has been seen as one of the founders of gnosticism and in the second century a simonian sect arose he is said to have always traveled with a 
woman whom he found in a brothel in tyre who was the reincarnation of helen of troy jung cited this as an example of the anima figure soul and earth

ojsimonianism based on the ancient sources with a reevaluation of his philosophy and teachings london the theosophical publishing house  
 in memories jung commented in such dream wandering one frequently encounters an old man who is accompanied by a young girl and examples of such couples are 
to be found in many mythic tales thus according to gnostic tradition simon magus went about with a young girl whom he had picked up in a brothel her name was 
helen and she was regarded as the reincarnation of the trojan helen klingsor and kundry laotzu and the dancing girl likewise belong in this category p

systema munditotius  cm x  cm in  jungs systema munditotius was 
published anonymously in a special issue of du dedicated to the eranos 
conferences in a letter of february ii  to walter corti jung explicitly 
stated that he did not want his name to appear with it ja he added the 
following comments to it it portrays the antinomies of the microcosm within 
the macrocosmic world and its antinomies at the very top the figure of the 
young boy in the winged egg called erikapaios or phanes and thus reminiscent 
as a spiritual figure of the orphic gods his dark antithesis in the depths is here 
designated as abraxas he represents the dominus mundi the lord of the physical 
world and is a worldcreator of an ambivalent nature sprouting from him we 
see the tree of life labeled vita life while its upper counterpart is a lighttree 
in the form of a sevenbranched candelabra labeled ignis fire and eros love 
its light points to the spiritual world of the divine child art and science also 
belong to this spiritual realm the first represented as a winged serpent and the 
second as a winged mouse as holedigging activity  the candelabra is based 
on the principle of the spiritual number three twicethree flames with one large 
flame in the middle while the lower world of abraxas is characterized by five the number of natural man the twicefive rays of his star the accompanying 
animals of the natural world are a devilish monster and a larva this signifies 
death and rebirth a further division of the mandala is horizontal to the left we 
see a circle indicating the body or the blood and from it rears the serpent which 
winds itself around the phallus as the generative principle the serpent is dark 
and light signifying the dark realm of the earth the moon and the void therefore 
called satanas the light realm of rich fullness lies to the right where from the 
bright circle jiigus sive amor dei cold or the love of god the dove of the holy 
ghost takes wing and wisdom sophia pours from a double beaker to left and 
right this feminine sphere is that of heaven the large sphere characterized 
by zigzag lines or rays represents an inner sun within this sphere the macrocosm 
is repeated but with the upper and lower regions reversed as in a mirror these 
repetitions should be conceived of as endless in number growing even smaller

enantiodromia of the lifetype 
it is difficult to force this image to make a statement yet it is 
so allegorical that it ought to speak it differs from the earlier 
experiences in that it is more witnessed than experienced for that 
matter all the images that i have placed under the title mystery 
play are rather more allegorical than actual experiences they are 
certainly not intended allegories they have not been consciously 
contrived to depict experience in either veiled or even fantastic 
terms rather they appeared as visions it was not until i reworked 
them later that i realized more and more that they could in no 
way be compared with the experiences portrayed in the other 
chapters these images apparently are portrayals of personified 
unconscious thoughts that follows from their imagistic manner 
they also called for more reflection and interpretation than the 
other experiences to which i could not do justice with cogitation 
because they were quite simply experiences the images of the 
mystery play on the other hand personify principles accessible 
to thinking and intellectual understanding and their allegorical 
manner accordingly also invites such an attempt at explanation 
the action is set in a dark earthly depth evidently an 
allegorical representation of the inner depths beneath the 
extension of the bright space of consciousness or the psychic field 
of vision sinking into such a depth corresponds to averting the 
mental gaze from outer things and focusing it on the inner dark 
depths gazing at the darkness to some extent animates the 
previously dark background since gazing at the darkness occurs 
without conscious expectation the inanimate psychic background 
has an opportunity to let its contents appear undisturbed by 
conscious assumptions 
the preceding experiences indicated that strong psychic 
movements were present that consciousness could not grasp 
two figuresthe old sage and the young maidenstep into the 
field of vision unexpectedly for consciousness but characteristic 
of the mythological spirit upon which consciousness rests this 
configuration is an image that forever recurs in the human spirit 
the old man represents a spiritual principle that could be desig
nated as logos and the maiden represents an unspiritual principle 
of feeling that could be called eros a descendent of logos is 
nous the intellect which has done away with the commingling 
of feeling presentiment and sensation in contrast the logos 
contains this commingling but it is not the product of such 
blending or else it would be a lower animalistic psychic activity 
yet it masters the blend so that the four fundamental activities of 
the soul become subordinate to its principle it is an independent 
principle of form that means understanding insight foresight 
legislation and wisdom the figure of an old prophet is there
fore a fitting allegory for this principle since the prophetic spirit 
unites in itself all these qualities in contrast eros is a principle 
that contains a commingling of all the fundamental activities of 
the soul just as much as it masters them although its purpose is completely different it is not formgiving but formfulfilling 
it is the wine that will be poured into the vessel it is not the bed 
and direction of the stream but the impetuous water flowing in 
it eros is desire longing force exuberance pleasure suffering 
where logos is ordering and insistence eros is dissolution and 
movement they are two fundamental psychic powers that form 
a pair of opposites each one requiring the other 
the old prophet expresses persistence but the young maiden 
denotes movement their impersonal essence is expressed by the 
fact that they are figures belonging to general human history they 
do not belong to a person but have been a spiritual content of the 
worlds peoples since time immemorial everyone has them and 
therefore these figures recur in the work of thinkers and poets 
such primordial images have a secret power that works just 
as much on human reason as on the soul wherever they appear 
they stir something linked with the mysterious the long gone 
and heavy with foreboding a string sounds whose vibration 
reverberates in every mans breast these primordial images dwell 
in everyone as they are the property of all manlcind this secret 
power is like a spell like magic and causes elevation just as much 
as seduction it is characteristic of primordial images that they 
talce hold of man where he is utterly human and a power seizes 
him as if the bustling throng were pushing him and this hap
pens even if individual understanding and feeling rise up against 
it what is the power of the individual against the voice of the 
whole people in him he is entranced possessed and consumed 
nothing makes this effect clearer than the serpent it signifies 
everything dangerous and everything bad everything nocturnal 
and uncanny which adheres to logos as well as to eros so long 
as they can work as the dark and unrecognized principles of the 
unconscious spirit 
the house represents a fixed abode which indicates that 
logos and eros have permanent residence in us 
salome is represented as the daughter of elijah thus 
expressing the order of succession the prophet is her producer 
she emanates from him the fact that she is assigned to him as 
a daughter indicates a subordination of eros to logos although 
this relation is very frequent as manifested by the constancy of 
this primordial image it is nevertheless a special case that possesses 
no general validity for if these were two opposed principles 
one could not arise from the other and thus depend on it salome 
is hence apparently no complete correct embodiment of eros 
but a variety of the same this supposition is later confirmed 
that she is actually an incorrect allegory for eros also stems from 
the fact that she is blind eros is not blind since he regulates just 
as well as logos does all fundamental activities of the soul the 
blindness indicates her incompleteness and the absence of an 
essential quality by virtue of her shortcoming she depends upon 
her father 
the indistinct glittering walls of the hall point to something 
unrecognized perhaps something valuable that wakens curiosity 
and attracts attention in this manner creative involvement is 
woven even deeper into the image so that an even greater anima
tion of the dark background becomes possible such enhanced 
attention gives rise to the image of an object which to all intents 
and purposes expresses concentration namely the image of a 
crystal which has been used to produce such visions since time 
immemorial these figures which at first are incomprehensible 
to the beholder evoke dark processes in his soul which to a cer
 the page numbers refer to the corrected drqft this corresponds to pp  above

libido  cw b n

tain extent lie even deeper such as in the vision of blood and 
whose perception requires an aid like the crystal as has been 
said however this expresses nothing else than an even stronger 
concentration of creative attention 
a figure like the prophet which is clear and complete in 
itself arouses less curiosity than the unexpected form of blind 
salome which is why one may expect that the formative process 
will first address the problem of eros hence an image of eve 
appears first together with images of the tree and the serpent 
this apparently refers to temptation as already encapsulated in 
the figure of salome temptation brings about a further movement 
toward the side of eros this in turn forebodes many adventurous 
possibilities for which the wandering of odysseus is the fitting 
image this image stimulates and invites adventurousness it is 
as if a door opened to a new opportunity to free the gaze from the 
dark confinement and depths in which it was held fast hence 
the vision opens onto a sunny garden whose red blooming 
trees represent a development of erotic feeling and whose wells 
mean a steady source the cool water of the well which does 
not inebriate indicates the logos therefore salome also speaks 
later of the deep wells of the prophet this suggests that the 
development of eros also means a source of knowledge and with 
this elijah begins to spealc 
logos undoubtedly has the upper hand in this my case since 
elijah says that he and his daughter have always been one yet 
logos and eros are not one but two in this case however logos 
has blinded and subjugated eros but if this is the case then the 
necessity will also arise to free eros from the clutch of logos so 
that the former will regain vision therefore salome turns to me 
because eros is in need of help and because i have apparently 
been enabled to behold this image for precisely this reason the 
soul of the man is more inclined to logos than to eros which is 
more characteristic of the essence of the woman the subjugation 
of eros through logos explains not only the blindness of eros but 
also the somewhat strange fact that eros is represented precisely 
by the notsopleasing figure of salome salome denotes bad 
qualities she brings to mind not only the murder of the holy one 
but also the incestuous pleasure of the father 
a principle always has the dignity of independence but if 
this dignity is taken from it it is debased and then assumes a 
bad form we know that psychic activity and qualities that are 
deprived of development through repression degenerate and 
thus become bad habits either an open or secret vice takes the 
place of a wellformed activity and gives rise to a disunity of 
the personality with itself signifying a moral suffering or a real 
sickness only one way remains open to whoever wants to free 
himself from this suffering he must accept the repressed part of 
his soul he must love his inferiority even his vices so that what 
is degenerate can resume development 
wherever logos rules there is order but too much persistence 
the allegory of paradise where there is no struggle and therefore 
no development is fitting here in this condition the repressed 
movement degenerates and its value is lost this is the murder 
of the holy one and the murder happens because like herod 
logos cannot protect the holy one on account of his own weak
ness because he can do nothing else than hold onto himself thus 
inducing the degeneration of eros only disobedience against 
the ruling principle leads out of this condition of undeveloped 
persistence the story of paradise repeats itself and hence the 
 this corresponds to pp  above serpent winds its way up the tree because adam should be led 
into temptation 
every development leads through the undeveloped but 
capable of development in its undeveloped condition it is almost 
worthless while development represents a highest value that is 
unquestionable one must give up this value or at least apparently 
give it up to be able to attend to the undeveloped but this stands 
in the sharpest contrast to the developed which perhaps rep
resents our best and highest achievement the acceptance of the 
undeveloped is therefore like a sin like a false step a degeneration 
a descent to a deeper level in actual fact however it is a greater 
deed than remaining in an ordered condition at the expense of the 
other side of our being which is thus at the mercy of decay 
pp  
the scene of the action is the same place as in the first image the 
allusion to a crater heightens the impression of a large cavity that 
reaches far down into the interior of the earth this depth is not 
nactive but violently discharges all kinds of matter 
since eros poses the most serious problem at first salome 
enters the scene blindly groping her way toward the left even what 
appear to be negligible details are important in such visionary 
images the left is the side of the inauspicious this suggests that 
eros does not tend toward the right the side of consciousness 
conscious will and conscious choice but toward the side of the 
heart which is less subject to our conscious will this movement 
toward the left is emphasized by the fact that the serpent moves 
in the same direction the serpent represents magical power 
which also appears where animal drives are aroused imperceptibly 
in us they afford the movement of eros the uncanny emphasis 
that strikes us as magical magical effect is the enchantment and 
underlining of our thought and feeling through dark instinctual 
impulses of an animal nature 
the movement toward the left is blind that is without 
purpose and intention it hence requires guidance not by 
conscious intention but by logos elijah calls salome back her 
blindness is an affliction and as such demands healing closer 
scrutiny at least partially invalidates the prejudice against her 
she seems to be innocent and perhaps her badness ought to be 
attributed to her blindness 
logos asserts its power over eros by calling back salome the 
serpent also obeys logos it rests with logos and eros to emphasize 
the power and significance of this image a natural consequence 
of this magical powerful view of the union of logos and eros is 
the strongly felt smallness and insignificance of the i which finds 
expression in a sense of boyishness 
it appears as if the movement toward the left following 
blind eros is not possible or effectively disallowed without the 
intervention of logos from the perspective of logos following 
a movement blindly is a sin because it is onesided and violates 
the law that man must forever strive for the highest degree of 
consciousness therein lies his humanity the other he has in 
common with animals jesus also says if you lmow what you are 
doing you are blessed if you do not know what you are doing 
you are damned the movement toward the left would be 
possible and permitted only if a conscious seeing notion of it 
existed formulating such a notion is not possible without the 
intervention of logos 
 this sentence is an apocryphal insertion to luke  from the codex bezae man if indeed you know what you are doing happy are you but if not you are accursed 
and a transgressor of the law j k elliot ed the apocryphal new testament p  in  jung cited it in answer toob cw ii

appendix b i  
the first step toward developing such a notion is to become controlling the flesh since he has altogether moved beyond 
conscious of the goal or intention of the movement hence elijah pleasure and suffering passion whose conquest still requires so 
asks about the intention of the i and it must admit its blindness much effort in the case of christ and does so incessantly and in 
that is its ignorance about intention the only recognizable ever greater measure has left buddha and surrounds him as a 
thing is a longing a wish to unravel the embroilment caused by blazing fire he is both unaffected and untouchable 
the first image but if the living i approaches this condition its passion may 
such making conscious stirs a vague sense of happiness in leave it though it will not die or are we not our passion and 
salome understandably so since consciousness means insight what happens to our passion when it leaves the i the i is 
that is a healing of her blindness thus a step toward attaining consciousness which only has eyes in front it never sees what 
the healing of eros is taken is behind it but that is where the passion it has overcome in 
at first the i remains in its inferior position since its ignorance front regroups unguided by the eye of reason unmitigated 
prevents it from surveying the further development of its problem by humaneness the fire becomes a devastating bloodthirsty 
nor would it know which direction to take since it has never kali who devours the life of man from within as the mantra 
cast its gaze into the depths of its psychic substratum but has of her sacrificial ceremony says hail to you  kali triple
seen only what meets the eye and recognized only the powers eyed goddess of dreadful aspect from whose throat hangs a 
of consciousness and the conscious world as effective forces necldace of human skulls may you be honored with this blood 
halfconsciously denying its inner impulses faced with its own salome must of course despair of this end which would like to 
depths such an i can only feel embarrassed its belief in a conscious turn eros into spirit since eros cannot exist without the flesh in 
upperworld had been so firm that going down into the depths of resisting the inferiority of the flesh the i resists its female soul 
the self is like guilt a betrayal of conscious ideals which represents everything that strives to suppress conscious 
but since its desire to unravel the embroilment is greater than ness against spirit thus this path also results in an opposition 
its aversion to its own inferiority the i entrusts itself to the guidance hence the i returns from beholding the figures embodying 
of logos since nothing comes into view that could answer the its conflict 
question raised even greater depths must evidently be opened up logos and eros are reunited as if they had overcome the 
this in turn occurs with the help of the crystal that is through conflict between spirit and flesh they appear to know the solution 
the utmost concentration of expectant attention the first image the movement toward the left which started from eros at the 
to appear in the crystal is the mother of god with child beginning of the image now commences from logos he starts 
this image is obviously related and opposed to the vision of moving toward the left to complete with seeing eyes what began 
eve in the first image just as eve represents carnal temptation in blindness at first this movement leads into greater darkness 
and carnal motherhood the mother of god stands for carnal which is then still somewhat illumined by the reddish light the 
virginity and spiritual motherhood the first direction would be color red points to eros while it does not emit a bright light 
a movement of eros toward the flesh the latter toward the spirit eros at least provides an opportunity to recognize something 
eve is an expression of the carnal side whereas mary expresses perhaps even merely by inducing a situation in which man can 
the spiritual side of eros as long as the i saw only eve it was recognize something provided logos assists him 
blind the evocation of awareness however affords a spiritual elijah leans against the marble lion the lion as a royal animal 
view of eros in the first case the i became an odysseus on an signifies power the stone suggests unshakeable firmness 
adventurous journey which concludes with the aging mans thereby expressing the power and solidity of logos once again 
return to penelope the motherly woman  awareness commences first although now in greater depths and 
in the latter case the i is depicted as peter the chosen rock in renewed surroundings here the i experiences its smallness 
upon which the church is to be founded the key as the symbol even more as it is even further removed from the world it knows 
of the power of binding and loosing buttresses this idea and where it is conscious of its value and meaning in these new 
leads one to the image of the pope as gods governor on earth surroundings there is nothing to remind it of its meaning hence 
with a threefold crown it is obviously overwhelmed by so much otherness which so 
undoubtedly the i becomes involved in a movement toward completely eludes its own discretion elijah assumes control of 
spiritual power as attested by the onesidedness of the movement developing awareness 
the vision of eve leads astray to adventurous odyssey to circe as the crystal visions have shown the idea that should be 
and calypso the vision of the mother of god on the other conveyed to consciousness is an idea of spiritual power that 
hand turns desire away from the flesh and toward the humble is the i was tempted to arrogate prophethood but this idea 
veneration of the spirit eros is subject to error in the flesh but encountered such a feeling of resistance that it could not assert 
in the spirit it rises above the flesh and the inferiority of carnal itself against consciousness hence it remained behind the 
error it therefore almost imperceptibly becomes the spirit the curtain but since the i could not follow eros blindly it sought 
power over the flesh in the guise of love and thus spiritual power at least to exchange spiritual power for this lossas observed 
casts off the mantle of love although the former believes it loves so very often in human life it is almost inevitable that such a 
the spirit in effect it rules the flesh and the more powerful it is great loss like that of eros presses man to search for a substitute 
the less loving it is and the less it loves the spirit the more it is at least in the sphere of power this occurs in such an uncanny 
carnal power on account of its power over the flesh the love of cunning manner that the i mostly fails to notice the ruse which 
the spirit thus becomes a secular powerdrive in spiritual guise explains why the i as a rule cannot enjoy its power since it does 
christ overcame the world by burdening himself with its not possess power but is possessed by the powerdevil in this 
suffering but buddha overcame both the pleasure and suffering case it would have been easy for the i to grasp the fact that elijah 
of the world by disposing of both and thus he entered into imposes himself with such living reality and lay claim to this 
nonbeing a condition from which there is no return buddha figure as a personality valuable in itself but awareness has 
is an even higher spiritual power that derives no pleasure from forestalled this deception

 i appendix b 
the appearance of living figures should not be taken personally 
even though one is obviously inclined to assume responsibility 
yfor them in reality such figures belong just as much or little 
to our personality as our hands and feet the mere presence of 
hands or feet is not characteristic of personality if anything 
about them is characteristic it is merely their individual character 
it is thus characteristic of the i that the old man and the young 
maiden are called elijah and salome they might just as well 
have been called simon magus and helena what is significant 
however is that they are biblical figures as proven later this is 
one of the peculiarities of the psychic entanglement belonging to 
this moment 
the awareness of the alluring idea of spiritual power shifts 
the question of eros into the foreground again once more in a 
new form both the possibility indicated by eve and the one 
represented by mary are ruled out hence the third possibility 
remains namely filial relationship which avoids the two extremes 
of the flesh and the spirit elijah as the father salome as the 
sister the i as the son and brother this solution corresponds to 
the christian notion of childhood in god salomeas mary
makes up the asyetabsent mother in what is a formidably 
ensnaring manner this has a corresponding effect on the i there 
is something undeniably cathartic about the christian solution
because it seems to be altogether possible there is a child in 
each of us in the elderly it is even the only thing still alive 
one can have recourse to the childlike anytime on account of 
its inexhaustible freshness and adherence everything even the 
most ominous can be rendered harmless through retranslation 
into the childlike after all we do this often enough in everyday 
life we even manage to tame a passion by leading it back to 
the childlike and perhaps the flame of passion collapses in 
a childlike lament even more often thus there are many 
prospects for which the childlike can seem to be a satisfactory 
remedy including not least the farreaching effect of our 
christian education which hammers into us the notion of 
childhood in hundreds of mantras and hymns 
salomes remark that mary is their mother must thus appear 
even more devastating since this prevents the childlike solution 
from developing it immediately prompts another thought if 
mary is the mother then inescapably i must be christ the childlike 
solution would have canceled all reservations salome would 
no longer pose a threat since she would be only the little 
sister elijah would be the caring father whose wisdom and 
foresight would have left the i to its own devices with 
childlike trust 
but this is the unfortunate drawback constituted by childhood 
as a solution every child wishes to grow being a child involves 
the burning desire and impatienc for future adulthood if we 
return to being a child for fear of the dangers of eros the 
child will want to develop toward spiritual power but if we flee 
into childhood for fear of the dangers of the spirit we fall into 
arrogating the power of eros 
the condition of spiritual childhood constitutes a transition 
in which not everyone can remain in this case it stands to 
reason that eros demonstrates to the i the impossibility of 
being a child one might think that it is not that awful to 
renounce the condition of childhood but only those who 
fail to grasp the consequences of this renunciation think that 
way it is not the loss of immemorial christian views and the 
religious possibilities they ensured many bear this loss all too 
easilybut rather that what is renounced refers to the much more 
profound attitude that far transcends the christian outlook which provides individual life and thought with a tried and 
tested direction even if one has long abstained from christian 
religious practice and has long ceased to regret this loss one 
continues to behave intuitively as if the original views still 
existed by right one fails to consider that a discarded world
view needs to be replaced by a new one in particular one fails 
to be clear about the fact that renouncing the christian outlook 
erodes presentday morals renouncing childhood means that 
no emotional or habitual dependence on hitherto valid moral 
views any longer exists the hitherto valid view has arisen from 
the spirit of the christian worldview 
notwithstanding all free thinking our attitude to eros for 
instance remains the old christian view we can now no longer 
bide our time peacefully without questioning and doubt or else 
we will remain in the state of childhood if we merely reject the 
dogmatic view our liberation from the wellestablished will be 
merely intellectual whereas our deeper feeling will persist on 
the old path most people however are unaware of how this sets 
them at odds with themselves but later generations will become 
increasingly aware of this yet those who notice this will realize 
with horror that renouncing resumed childhood ousts them 
from our present times and that they can no longer follow any 
of the traditional ways they enter uncharted territory which 
has neither paths nor boundaries they lack any direction since 
they have forsaken all established bearings this realization 
however dawns upon very few since the vast majority makes do 
with half measures and remains unperturbed by the stupidity of 
their spiritual condition but then tepidity and slackness is not 
to everyones taste some would rather abandon themselves to 
despair than adhere to a worldview completely removed from 
the welltrodden paths of their habitual behavior they would 
rather venture into a pathless dark land at the risk of perishing 
there even if this should outrage all their cowardice 
when salome remarks that mary is their mother which 
means that the i is christ this means in brief that the i has 
left the state of christian childhood and has taken the place of 
christ nothing could be more absurd of course than to assume 
that the i thus would be presuming excessive importance on 
the contrary it talces up a decidedly inferior position previously 
it had the advantage of being part of the crowd rallying behind 
a powerful figure but now it has exchanged that for solitude 
and forlornness rendering it as alien and lonely in its world as 
jesus was in his without possessing that great mans outstanding 
attributes being at odds with the world requires greatness 
but the i experiences its almost ludicrous meagerness which 
explains its horror at salomes revelations 
whoever steps beyond the christian outlook yet does so 
definitely falls into a seeming abyss an utmost solitude and 
lacks any means of hiding the fact of course one would like to 
persuade oneself that this is not all that bad but it is 
abandonment is about the worst thing that can happen to mans 
herd instinct not to mention the daunting task with which 
we thus burden ourselves destruction is easy but rebuilding 
is difficult 
thus the image ends with a sense of gloom which stands 
opposed however to the tall quietly burning flame encircled 
by the serpent this view denotes devotion  coupled with the 
magical compulsion expressed by the serpent thus an effective 
counterpart is set against the disquieting sense of doubt and fear 
as if someone were saying of course your i is full of unease and 
doubt but the constant flame of devotion burns in you more 
strongly and the compulsion of your fate is more powerful

the farreaching premonitions of the second image plunged the 
i into a chaos of doubt hence an understandable desire arose to 
rise above the confusion to attain greater clarity as expressed in 
the image of the beetling mountain ridge logos appears to be 
leading the way what occurs next is the image of two opposites 
expressed by two serpents and the separation of day and night 
daylight signifies good whereas darkness represents evil as 
compelling forces both assume the figure of serpents therein 
lies concealed an idea that subsequently assumes great importance 
whoever encountered a black serpent would have been no less 
surprised at encountering a white one color does not dispel 
fear what this suggests is that perhaps an equally dangerous 
bewitching power resides in good as in evil essentially the 
good needs to be regarded as an inherently nolessdangerous 
principle than evil in any event the i could decide to approach 
the white serpent just as little as the black one even though 
 this refers to pp  appendix b i  
it believes it can or must by all means entrust itself more to 
good than to evil but the i is rooted to the spot halfway 
transfixed and observes the struggle between the two principles
within itself 
the fact that the i remains in this middle position implies the 
advance of evil since anything but unconditional surrender to the 
good impairs it this finds expression in the attack of the black 
serpent but the fact that the i does not partale of evil constitutes 
a victory for the good this finds expression in the black serpent 
growing a white head 
the disappearance of the serpent denotes that the opposition 
of good and evil has become ineffective that is that at least it has 
lost its immediate significance for the i this means a release from 
the unconditional power of the hitherto abiding moral point 
of view in favor of a middle position freed from the pair of 
opposites but neither clarity nor a clear view has been gained 
thereby hence the ascent continues to the final point of elevation 
which might grant the longedfor outlook

appendix c 
the following is an entry from black book  which gives a 
preliminary sketch of cosmology of the septem sermones 
r i r 
the force of the god is frightful 
you shall experience even more of it you are in the second 
age the first age has been overcome this is the age of the 
rulership of the son whom you call the frog god a third age will 
follow the age of apportionment and harmonious power 
my soul where did you go did you go to the animals 
i bind the above with the below i bind god and animal 
something in me is part animal something part god and a third 
part human below you serpent within you man and above you 
god beyond the serpent comes the phallus then the earth then 
the moon and finally the coldness and emptiness of outer space 
above you comes the dove or the celestial soul in which 
love and foresight are united just as poison and shrewdness are 
united in the serpent shrewdness is the devils understanding 
which always detects smaller things and finds chinks where you 
suspect none 
if i am not conjoined through the uniting of the below and 
the above i brealc down into three parts the serpent and in that 
or some other animal form i roam living nature daimonically 
arousing fear and longing the human soul living forever within 
you the celestial soul as such dwelling with the gods far from 
you and unknown to you appearing in the form of a bird each of 
these three parts then is independent 
beyond me stands the celestial mother its counterpart is the 
phallus its mother is the earth its goal is the heavenly mother 
the celestial mother is the daughter of the celestial world its 
counterpart is the earth 
the celestial mother is illuminated through the spiritual sun 
its counterpart is the moon and just as the moon is the cross
ing to the dead of space the spiritual sun is the crossing to the 
pleroma the upper world of fullness the moon is the gods 
eye of emptiness just as the sun is the gods eye of fullness the 
moon that you see is the symbol just as the sun that you see sun 
and moon that is their symbols are gods there are still other 
gods their symbols are the planets 
the celestial mother is a daimon among the order of the gods 
an inhabitant of the heavenly world 
the gods are favorable and unfavorable impersonal the souls of 
stars influences forces grandfathers of souls rulers in the heavenly 
world both in spae and in force they are neither dangerous nor 
kind strong yet humble clarifications of the pleroma and of the 
eternal emptiness configurations of the eternal qualities 
their number is immeasurably great and leads over to the one 
supreme fundamental which contains all qualities in itself and 
itself has none a nothing and everything the complete dissolution 
of man death and eternal life 
man becomes through the principium individuationis he strives 
for absolute individuality through which he ever increasingly 
concentrates the absolute dissolution of the pleroma through 
this he malces the pleroma the point that contains the greatest tension and is itself a shining star immeasurably small just as 
the pleroma is immeasurably great the more concentrated 
the pleroma becomes the stronger the star of the individual 
becomes it is surrounded by shining clouds a heavenly body in 
the making comparable to a small sun it emits fire therefore it 
is called eyoj etlt oultaavos ultv aotlp just like the sun which 
is also such a star which is a god and grandfather of souls the star 
of the individual is also like the sun a god and grandfather of the 
souls he is visible from time to time just as i have described him 
his light is blue like that of a distant star he is far out in space 
cold and solitary since he is beyond death to attain individuality 
we need a large share of death therefore it is called et eot eoe 
since just as an innumerable number of men rule the earth so a 
countless number of stars and of gods rule the celestial world 
to be sure this god is the one who survives the death of men 
to him for whom solitude is heaven he goes to heaven to him 
for whom it is hell he goes to hell whoever does not follow 
the principium individuationis to its end becomes no god since he 
cannot bear individuality 
the dead who besiege us are souls who have not fulfilled the 
principium individuationis or else they would have become distant 
stars insofar as we do not fulfill it the dead have a claim on us 
and besiege us and we cannot escape them image  
the god of the frogs or toads the brainless is the uniting of 
the christian god with satan his nature is like the flame he is 
like eros but a god eros is only a daimon 
the one god to whom worship is due is in the middle 
you should worship only one god the other gods are unimport
ant abraxas is to be flared therefore it was a deliverance when he 
separated himself from me you do not need to seek him he will 
find you just like eros he is the god of the cosmos extremely 
powerful and fearful he is the creative drive he is form and 
formation just as much as matter and force therefore he is 
above all the light and dark gods he tears away souls and casts 
them into procreation he is the creative and created he is the 
god who always renews himsel in days in months in years in 
human life in ages in peoples in the living in heavenly bodies 
he compels he is unsparing if you worship him you increase his 
power over you thereby it becomes unbearable you will have 
dreadful trouble getting clear of him the more you free yourself 
from him the more you approach death since he is the life of 
the universe but he is also universal death therefore you fall 
victim to him again not in life but in dying so remember him 
do not worship him but also do not imagine that you can flee 
him since he is all around you you must be in the middle of 
life surrounded by death on all sides stretched out like one 
crucified you hang in him the fearful the overpowering 
but you have in you the one god the wonderfully beautiful 
and kind the solitary starlike unmoving he who is older and 
wiser than the father he who has a safe hand who leads you 
among all the darknesses and death scares of dreadful abraxas 
he gives joy and peace since he is beyond death and beyond what 
is subject to change he is no servant and no friend of abraxas 
he himself is an abraxas but not unto you but in himself and his 
distant world since you yourself are a god who lives in faraway 
realms and who renews himself in his ages and creations and 
peoples just as powerful to them as abraxas is to you 
you yourself are a creator of worlds and a created being 
i i am a star wandering about with you a citation from the mithras liturgy albrecht dieterich eine mithrasliturgie leipzig b g teubner  p  line  jung

you have the one god and you become your one god in the 
innumerable number of gods 
as a god you are the great abraxas in your world but as a 
man you are the heart of the one god who appears to his world 
as the great abraxas the feared the powerful the donor of 
madness he who dispenses the water of life the spirit of the tree 
of life the daimon of the blood the death bringer 
you are the suffering heart of your one star god who is 
abraxas to his world 
therefore because you are the heart of your god aspire 
toward him love him live for him fear abraxas who rules over 
the human world accept what he forces upon you since he is 
the master of the life of this world and none can escape him if 
you do not accept he will torment you to death and the heart of 
your god will suffer just as the one god of christ suffered the 
heaviest in his death 
the suffering of mankind is without end since its life is 
without end since there is no end where none sees an end if 
mankind has come to an end there is none who would see its 
end and none who could say that mankind has an end so it has 
no end for itself but it certainly does for the gods 
the death of christ took no suffering away from the world 
but his life has taught us much namely that it pleases the 
one god if the individual lives his own life against the power of 
abraxas the one god thus delivers himself from the suffering 
of the earth into which his eros plunged him since when the 
one god saw the earth he sought its procreation and forgot 
that a world was already given to him in which he was abraxas 
so the one god became human therefore the one in turn 
pulls man up to him and into him so that the one becomes 
complete again 
but the freeing of man from the power of abraxas does not 
follow mans withdrawing from the power of abraxasno one 
can pull away from itbut through subjugating himself to it 
even christ had to subjugate himself to the power of abraxas 
and abraxas killed him in a gruesome manner 
only by living life can you free yourself from it so live it to 
such a degree that it befits you to the degree that you live it 
you also fall victim to the power of abraxas and his dreadful 
deceptions but to the same degree the star god in you gains 
in longing and power in that the fruit of deception and human 
disappointment falls to him pain and disappointment fill the 
world of abraxas with coldness all of your lifes warmth slowly appendix c i  
sinks into the depths of your soul into the midpoint of man 
where the far blue starlight of your one god glimmers 
if you flee abraxas from fear you escape pain and disappoint
ment and you remain terrified that is out of unconscious love 
you cling to abraxas and your one god cannot catch fire but 
through pain and disappointment you redeem yourself since 
your longing then falls of its own accord like a ripe fruit into the 
depths following gravity striving toward the midpoint where 
the blue light of the star god arises 
so do not flee from abraxas do not seek him you feel 
his coercion do not resist him so that you shall live and pay 
your ransom 
the works of abraxas are to be fulfilled for consider that in 
your world you yourself are abraxas and force your creature to 
fulfil your work here where you are the creature subjugated to 
abraxas you must learn to fulfill the work of life there where 
you are abraxas you compel your creatures 
you ask why is all this so i understand that it seems 
questionable to you the world is questionable it is the unending 
infinite folly of the gods which you know is unendingly wise 
surely it is also a crime an unforgivable sin and therefore also the 
highest love and virtue 
so live life do not flee abraxas provided that he compels you 
and you can recognize his necessity in one sense i say to you do 
not fear him do not love him in another sense i say fear him 
love him he is the life of the earth that says enough 
you need to recognize the multiplicity of the gods you 
cannot unite all into one being as little as you are one with the 
multiplicity of men just so little is the one god one with the 
multiplicity of the gods this one god is the kind the loving 
the leading the healing to him all your love and worship is due 
to him you should pray you are one with him he is near you 
nearer than your soul 
i your soul am your mother who tenderly and frightfully 
surrounds you your nourisher and corrupter i prepare good 
things and poison for you i am your intercessor with abraxas i 
teach you the arts that protect you from abraxas i stand between 
you and abraxas the allencompassing i am your body your 
shadow your effectiveness in this world your manifestation in 
the world of the gods your effulgence your breath your odor 
your magical force you should call me if you want to live with 
men but the one god if you want to rise above the human world 
to the divine and eternal solitude of the star
