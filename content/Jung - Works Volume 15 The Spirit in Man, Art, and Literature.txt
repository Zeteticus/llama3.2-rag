 paracelsus  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  princeton university press 
  p p  
the life philosophy and cont ributions to modem science of the medieval swiss physician paracelsus 
are discussed in an address presente d at parlacelsus birth place shadowed by the alps it is considered 
to have had an importantly early biographical influe nce on paracelsus which gave him the typical swiss 
qualities of selfreliance obstinacy and pride th e most important influence on paracelsus however 
was his father whose fate he set out to avenge pa racelsus revenge took the form of withholding love 
from everyone except his father for as far as is  known he never loved anyo ne else after extensive 
travel and study paracelsus achieved fame as a selftaught and excellent  physician who offended 
everyone with his arrogance toward middle age he became interested in philosophy and medicine 
although emotionally paracelsus re mained a good catholic intelle ctually he embraced a pagan 
philosophy influenced by the neoplatonist marsil io ficino to designate his highest cosmogonic 
principle paracelsus coined the word yliaster or  hylaster which might be translated as cosmic 
matter for him the spiritual principle took second place to cosmic matter man and the world were 
both seen as parts of anim ate matter thus while being a medieval animist who believed nature is full of 
witches incubi and other spirits paracelsus was at  the same time a modem materialist according to 
him everything consists of animate particles or enti a diseases included diseases therefore are natural 
necessary constituents of life rath er than hated and foreign ones th e sources of paracelsus thought and 
work were his own psyche which he probed in depth and superstitious pagan be liefs which he collected 
extensively while working within the confines of existing medieval knowledge he used the methods of 
scientific empiricism thus adding to  the modem understanding of the nature of disease and of life itself  
 paracelsus the physician  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  princeton 
university press   p p   
a summary of paracelsuss ideas about the nature of the physicians science is presented although it is 
noted that his prodigious literary output much of it obscure contradictory and colored by his abrasive 
personality makes interpretation difficult quotati ons from his own work ar e used extensively in 
outlining his conservatism evident in  his catholicism his belief in  alchemy and astrology and emphasis 
on folklore as well as his rebellion against academ ic medicine paracelsuss central idea is the 
importance of understanding external things as a way to understanding the internal the physician is 
seen as gaining his knowledge of disease not from th e patient but from the study of external phenomena 
particularly the study of alchemy which enables the physician to dia gnose diseases from their analogy 
with the diseases of minerals astrology is considered  to be the other important source of the physicians 
knowledge in that each organ of the body corresponds to  a star a relationship that must be considered 
during treatment paracelsuss  belief in magic is considered to fo retell the place of chemistry in modem 
medicine the psychotherapeutic aspect of paracel suss work is discussed with examples of his 
compassion toward his pati ents  references  
 sigmund freud in hi s historical setting  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  
princeton university press   p p   
freuds work is evaluated in the ligh t of the influence of its historical  conditioning that of the transition 
from the victorian age to the th century the ma in thrust of freuds t hought that pathology results 
from unnecessary sexual repression is seen as a necessary antidote to victorian morality on the other 
hand freuds commitment to rational  explanations is considered an outgrowth of th century thought 
it is considered more accura te to view freud as an exem plar of the resentment of the new centur y for the 

old than as a harbinger of new truths freuds emphasi s on sexual repression as the cause of neurosis at 
the expense of other psychological phenomena and his firm roots in the th century european doctors 
consulting room are viewed as caus es of the seemingly parochial natu re of his work it is concluded 
that although freud did not penetrate the deeper trut hs common to all peoples he did admirably fulfill 
his historical task  reference  
 in memory of sigmund freud in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  princeton 
university press   p p   
the course of freuds career and his contributions to psychology are re viewed beginning with his initial 
work on hysteria and hypnosis under charcot the devel opment of freuds theory of neurosis is traced 
the repression of sexual trauma stem ming from the existence of infantil e sexuality is considered to be 
at the root of all neuros es this theory together with the unort hodox idea put forth in the interpretation 
of dreams namely that dreams ar e an important source  of knowledge about the unconscious are seen 
as being freuds most significant  contributions freuds later excu rsions into philosophy religion and 
primitive psychology are viewed negatively since he  saw everything through the eyes of a physician 
and was inadequately trained in other fields fre ud was unable to transfer successfully his views on 
neurosis to other areas in addition he saw onl y the unfavorable or ambiguous aspects of the 
unconscious at the expense of its creative and heat ing powers freuds psychology is considered an 
important contribution toward destr oying the false ideals of the th cen tury but inadequate in fulfilling 
the needs of the th  references  
 richard wilhelm in memoriam  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  
princeton university press   p p   
the sinologist richard wilhelms creation of a br idge between eastern and western cultures is 
discussed in an address originally delivered at a memorial service for him wilhelms greatest 
achievement is seen to be his translation of and commentary on the iching through this work 
wilhelm opened to the european world a different view of science one ba sed not on the causality 
principle but on what is tentatively called the synchroni stic principle this term and its relationship to 
astrology comprise the basic formula of the iching which is accepted in this address as a premise it is 
considered the purest expression of chinese thought a badly needed al ternative to western 
intellectualism and rationalism a danger is seen  nonetheless in embracing this new philosophy too 
enthusiastically since its true valu e lies not in blindly accepting it but in integrating it into our own 
culture wilhelms ability to approach an alien culture freely modestly a nd without prejudice is 
admired and his clarification and confirmation of much of  jungs own work is noted in conclusion 
more was learned from wilhelm than  from any other man  references  
 on the relation of analytical psychology to poetry  in jung c collected works of c g 
jung vol  princeton universi ty press   p p   
the relation between psychology and ar t is discussed in a study of the cr eative process in poetry and its 
connection to analytical psychology th e essential definition of art is not discussed here since it is 
considered to belong to esthetics not psychology rather the emotions and symbols surrounding art are 
explored the discussion begins with a criticism of the medical reductionism practiced by freud 
although freud is correct in maintaining that a poets biography illuminates his wo rk it does not totally 
explain it analytical psychology is seen as diff erent from medical psychol ogy the latter must be 
discarded when examining a work of art for a work  of art is not a disease and requires a different 
analytical approach two basic types of art are iden tified and some criteria provided for differentiating 
between them the first introverted is the result of the ar tists assertion of hi s own conscious alms upon 
his material the second extraverted  is characterized b y the artists com plete identification with his 
work in the second instance the artist seems to  cease being an individual and becomes a nutrient 
medium for the creation of his art  the creative process is described as a living thing implanted in the 
human psyche an autonomous complex which has a life  of its own outside ordinary consciousness the 
autonomous complex and specifically the autonomous creative complex are further defined the latter 
arises from the collective unconscious which consists of primordial images or archetypes ile emotional 
impact of these images when  they are present in a work of art is described in conclusion the creative 
process is defined as the unconscious activation of an  archetypal image and the shaping of this image 
into a finished work the social significance of ar t is derived from its redisc overy of lost primordial 
images which are brought up from the deepest unconsci ous an analogy is drawn between the role of the 
unconscious in individual development and that of art in the development of a nation just as reactions 
from the unconscious correct the one sidedness of an individuals atti tude so too does art represent a 
process of selfregulation in the life of nations and epochs  
 psychology and literature introduction   the work of art  the artist  in jung c 
collected works of c g jung vol  prince ton university press   p p   
the reasons for approaching literatur e from the viewpoint of analytical psychology and the role of the 
human psyche in both disciplines are outlined psychol ogy a study of psychic processes can be applied 
to the study of literature for the human psyche is th e womb of all the arts and sciences this approach 
takes two different forms in the first instance the obj ect of analysis is a concrete artistic achievement 
in the second it is the creative human being as  a unique personality alt hough these two aspects of 
creativity are intimately related neither can explai n the other two modes of  artistic creation are 
described the psychological deali ng with familiar materials drawn fr om mans conscious life and the 
visionary dealing with prim ordial images that transcend human unde rstanding the first mode is seen as 
a reduction of the artists vision to personal experien ce a reduction that deflects  our attention from the 
psychology of the work of art and focuses it on the ps ychology of the artist some  examples of literary 
works using the second visionary mode are given this  mode brings out night fears to our conscious 
mind from the beginnings of human society we find traces of mans efforts to banish his fears by 
expressing them in magical or propitiat ory forms it is to be expected th erefore that the poet will turn to 
these mythological images to give  suitable expression to his own e xperience since these images arise 
from the collective unconscious the psychologist can do little to elucidate them other than to provide 
comparative material and a terminol ogy for their discussion what is im portant for the study of literature 
is that the manifestations of the collective unconsci ous are compensatory to the conscious attitude a 
review of freuds ideas on creativity in the artist is provided and their shortcomings are pointed out the 
dual nature of the creative personality is noted the ar tist is both a human being with a personal life and 
an impersonal creative process this dual nature puts great strain on the artistic personality arousing the 
professional interest of the psychologist since the arti sts work responds to the needs of his society it 
has implications greater than thos e involving his own personal fate the archetypal images that the artist 
uses are morally neutral therefor e a great work of art is always morally and intellectually ambiguous 
to grasp its meaning we must allow it to shape us as  it shaped the artist it is suggested that this 
participation mystique is the secr et of artistic creation  and of the effect which great art has on the 
perceiver  references  
 ulysses a monologue  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  princeton 
university press   p p   
the subjective monologue of  james joyces ulysses a book that arouses the psychologists interest 
because of its controversial initia l reception and its considerable s ubsequent influence on contemporary 
authors is analyzed the readers frustration in  trying to decipher this book whose dominant note is 
utterly hopeless emptiness is described it is suggeste d that the work is an example of visceral thinking 
a process severel y restrictin g cerebral activit y and confinin g itself to information provided b y the 
perceptual processes certain simil arities with schizophrenia are de scribed ulysses however is no 
more a pathological product than is modem art as a w hole the schizophrenic qualities of the latter do 
not reflect the disease in any individual artist but  are a collective manifestat ion of our time in the 
insane distortions of mean ing and reality are a consequence of th e destruction of their personality the 
distortion present in the arti sts work is not destructive but rather  creative it is suggested that despite 
his seeming paganism joyce is actua lly very much an irish catholic instead of generating only local 
interest as might be expected joyces irish catholicism may acc ount for his books popular appeal as 
all of us are still citizens of the catholic middle ag es the books negativism pr esents a counterforce to 
that ages high moral ideals whereas the atrophy of f eeling in it is explained as a reaction against too 
much sentimentalism detachment of consciousness is  seen as the goal the ithaca of the whole book 
all the negative aspects of joyces book all that is coldblooded bizarre a nd banal grotesque and 
devilish is in fact a positive virtue that deserves praise at the end ulysses s masculine creative power 
turns into feminine acquiescence  the eternal fe mininestill draws us on ul ysses is considered the 
distillation of a new universal  consciousness  references  
 picasso  in jung c collected works of c g j ung vol  princeton university press  
 p p   
the psychology not the esthet ics of picassos art is discussed by viewing his art as a pictorial 
representation of psychic processe s analogies may be drawn between picassos work and the art done by 
mental patients both these are forms of nonobjective  art that draws its contents from the unconscious 
the pictorial expression of these unconscious contents makes them more accessible to the patients 
understanding the two different types of art produ ced by neurotic and schi zophrenic pa tients are 
described and the similaritie s between picassos work and that of the second group of patients are noted 
these similarities do not imply that picasso is schi zophrenic the two types of  art have one thing in 
common their symbolic content in either type of art a series of images begins as a rule with the 
symbol of the nekyia the journey to hades the descent into the unconscious examples of the nekyia 
in picassos work are pointed out the symbol of  the harlequin whose journey through the psychic 
history of mankind has as its  object the restoration of the whole man by awakening the memories of the 
blood is examined the symbols of madness experienced during a schizophrenics period of 
distintegration are usually followed by images that  represent the coming together of opposites it is 
noted that in picassos latest paintings this motif is seen very clearly no predictions are made about 
picassos future work although the basic tragedy of the harlequin figure is noted and compared with a 
similar figure in nietzsches zarathustra
