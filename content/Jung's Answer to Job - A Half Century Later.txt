it is now more than half a century since c g jung wrote answer to job jung
 to my mind one of the most important spiritual texts of the twentieth century that book was nothing less than a psychological study of the history of godover the last twentyfive hundred years less spectacularly considered jungattempted to understand how the self the image of god in the western psychehad undergone change and development over that time of special interest to himwas the problematic condition of that psychological image at the approaching endof the christian aion as jung put it
as might be expected the book was greeted with alarm and misunder
standing both in theological and scientific circles but has enjoyed a continuingjournal of jungian theory and practice vol  no  
interest among the educated public the larger academic world has neglected this
book but a recent scholarly work has gathered together all the relevant literaturebishop  theologians such as victor white from the catholic side white and martin buber from a jewish perspective buber  found much tocriticize in jungs attempt at the psychization so to speak of the god imagecomments even from some of jungs followers suggest a lack of understanding ofwhat he was about in a  volume of the journal of analytical psychology  for
example two analysts one from britain and one from israel believed it necessaryto interpret the text reductively as reflecting jungs childhood problems so it isnot surprising that this major work has proved difficult for many to grasp on theother hand another jungian edward edinger has written an excellent introduction and commentary edinger  a former jesuit jack miles has done something similar to jung in writing a biography of god miles  also basing him
self on the biblical text in a personal communication he told me that answer to
jobhad impressed him but that jung did not sufficiently appreciate the role of
israel i shall quote some of his work later on and add to it as well 
in this paper i propose to examine how jungs predictions have held up and
suggest how what he was trying to do can be extended even if only a little i willbegin by presenting a summary of that book together with some comments torefresh those who may not have read it for some time and to provide necessaryinformation for those who have not studied it i begin by giving the flavor ofjungs  writing after the introduction
the book of job is a landmark in the long historical development
of a divine drama at the time the book was written there werealready many testimonies which had given a contradictory picture of yahwehthe picture of a god who knew no moderationin his emotions and suffered precisely from this lack of moderation he himself admitted that he was eaten up with rage and jealousy and that this knowledge was painful to him insight existedalong with cruelty creative power along with destructivenesseverything was there and none of these qualities was an obstacleto the other such a condition is only conceivable either when noreflecting consciousness is present at all or when the capacity forreflection is very feeble and a more or less adventitious phenomenon a condition of this sort can only be described as amoralpara 
so does jung begin he describes himself as a modern man with a christian
education and background but his astonishing insight also gives a jew like mepause one must note that the general judaeochristian understanding is that itwas this same god image that demanded the highest level of moral attainmentthat was possible in the ancient world we are faced with the power of this divineantinomy and the experience of it in job whose greatest quality says jung is thathe does not doubt the unity of god he clearly sees that god is at odds withhimselfso flatly at odds that job is quite certain of finding in god a helper anadvocate against god as certain as he is of the evil in yahweh he is equally certain of the good para  god is a personality and tremendously involved withc g jungs answer to job
humankind in contrast with the allruling father zeus who in a benevolent and
somewhat detached manner para  allows the universe to go along and onlypunishes the disorderly the greek god did not moralize but ruled instinctivelydemanding only the sacrifices due him had neither plans for nor much involvement with human beings the jewish god needed human beings and swore todavid for example in the th psalm that he would not lie to him yet he whowatched so jealously over the fulfillment of laws and contracts broke his ownoath para  this is an image of a being that lacks selfreflection he is notimperfect or evil like a gnostic demiurge but is everything in its totality
why then does god need man he needs humankind says jung in order
to achieve a greater consciousness a more precise rendering of himself to himselfyet he is ambivalent about this abandoning his faithful servant job to evil thispoor victim of a divine plot is thereby secretly lifted up to a superior knowledgewhich god himself does not possess namely his own antinomy yet we discoverthat job is an outward occasion for an inward dialectic in god himself para it is as if god projects his skepticism on job and the latter is challenged as thoughhe himself were a god
man is enormously elevated thereby something that has never happened
before without knowing or wanting it a mortal man is raised by his moral behavior above the stars in heaven from which position of advantage he can behold theback of yahweh the abysmal world of shards para  jung is referring hereto the idea in kabbalah that the shards are counterpoles to the ten sephiroth  or
stages in the revelation and manifestation of gods creative power the shards represent the forces of evil which are a byproduct of the process of the sephiroth man
ifesting and a consequence of previous inadequate experiments in creation jobhas discovered that god is a phenomenon not a maneven less than human attimes para  jung points out that to assume that the creator of the world is aconscious being is a disastrous prejudice which leads to such nonsensical doctrinesas the privatio boni  that evil is just the absence of good job reacts in an adjusted
way but sees that yahweh behaves as irrationally as a cataclysm and then wantsto be loved honored worshipped and praised as just    one can submit to sucha god only with fear and trembling    but a relationship of trust is out of the question to our modern way of thinking paras  yet yahweh demands loyalty and gets it by humiliating job however he pronounces judgment on himselfand gives man moral satisfaction that is not recognized this could have resultedin the relativization that affected the greek gods but this did not happen for thenext two thousand years yet gods dual nature was perceived by the unconsciousmind of man and this was bound to have farreaching consequences
jung now makes a discursus back to the time when the book of job was writ
ten between  and  bce which places it also about the time of the book ofproverbs he does so in order to assess what was happening in the psyche at thistime he thereby demonstrates the development of the idea of the incarnationand the subsequent emergence of the christian story the book of proverbs showsthe effect of greek influence in that the idea of sophia the sapientia dei or wisdom
of god is presented as a feminine spirit that existed before creation this sophiais a part of god with characteristics like the johannine logos  the chochma of
kabbalah and also indian shakti  this feminine wisdom is exalted as the word ofj marvin spiegelman 
god who brooded over the waters at the beginning and has her throne in heav
en in the wisdom of solomon  she is wisdom as a loving spirit and better than
might again i quote more fully from jung
from the ancient records we know that the divine drama was
enacted between god and his people who were betrothed to himthe masculine dynamis like a woman and over whose faithfulness he watched jealously a particular instance of this is jobwhose faithfulness is subjected to a savage test as i have said thereally astonishing thing is how easily yahweh gives in to theinsinuations of satan if it were true that he trusted job perfectlyit would be logical for yahweh to defend him unmask the malicious slanderer and make him pay for his defamation of godsfaithful servant but yahweh never thinks of it not even afterjobs innocence has been proved we hear nothing of a rebuke ordisapproval of satan therefore we cannot doubt yahwehs connivance his readiness to deliver job into satans murderoushands proves that he doubts job precisely because he projects hisown tendency to unfaithfulness upon a scapegoat there is reasonto suspect that he is about to loosen his matrimonial ties withisrael but hides this intention from himself para 
jung shows that god with the help of satan infallibly picks on the most
faithful of the lot job at the same time god remembers a feminine being whowas a friend and playmate from the beginning of the world a firstborn stainlessreflection of his glory and a master workman namely sophia para  theremust be some dire necessity for this anamnesis of sophia things just could not goon as before the just god could not go on committing injustices and theomniscient could not behave any longer like a clueless and thoughtless humanbeing selfreflection becomes imperative and for this wisdom is needed we realize that the failure to corrupt job has induced changes in yahwehs nature
jung carefully traces the early archetypal stories involving the pure son and
impure one he also reminds us that god did not say it is good for the creationof monday the second day in which separation of the upper and lower firmamenttook place this dualism was not good in the pleroma  the background there is
a perfect interplay of cosmic forces but with creationthe division of the wordinto distinct processes in space and timeconflict occurs perfection and completion begin their opposition we also now discover that yahwehs marriage withisrael had perfectionist aims in it and lacked the kind of relatedness that we nowknow as eros rather than values and the appreciated subjectivity of the partner there is only a relationship to a purpose which man must help to fulfillfaithfulness of his people becomes more important the more he forgets wisdom
job is the climax of this development man sees the split in god needs
wisdom as an advocate god having been met and seen needs her too thereforethis realization of sophia wisdom betokens a coming act of creation which usesthe egyptian model of incarnation in pharaoh but this is not merely repeating thearchetype mechanically the real reason for gods becoming man is to be soughtin his encounter with job para  this time it is not the world that is to bec g jungs answer to job
changed rather it is god who intends to change his own nature only one human
being is to be created a godman born of a human woman a second eve thisincarnation was only partial since it was necessary to protect against evil andthus he was more divine than human therefore the perfectionism continued yetsays jung one should make clear to oneself what it means when god becomesman it means nothing less than a worldshaking transformation of god it meansmore or less what creation meant in the beginning namely an objectivation ofgod at the time of the creation he revealed himself in nature now he wants tobe more specific and become man para 
from this we can understand that god is reality itself when god created the
world from the void he breathed his own mystery into every part of it fromthis comes the belief that it is possible to know god from his creation para if god is in everything already why the incarnation one would like to say thatchrist had to appear in order to deliver mankind from evil but in fact yahwehcould have simply stopped satan if he had wished rather what we see is thatyahweh god must become man precisely because he has done man a wrong he theguardian of justice knows that every wrong must be expiated and wisdom knows thatmoral law is above even him because his creature has surpassed him he must regeneratehimself para  italics added jung does not bring to our attention here the
familiar medieval image of mary cradling the unicorn in her lap seen as the wrathof god contained by her in conceiving the new divine child but the link with thisparticular symbol of regeneration is most apropos
jung now shows us how the hero myth is invoked in order to bring about the
desired experience of the divine who now needs to know what it is like to be ahuman being the dove and the lovegoddess are implied but the change in theordinary myth of the herogod dying young is shown by the precise experience ofchrist he is certainly identified with his love of humankind but the scripturesalso reveal a certain irascibility in his temperament as is often the case withpeople who do not reflect about themselves the great exception to this lack ofquestioning himself is found only at the very end when he cries despairingly onthe cross my god my god why hast thou forsaken me jung now reveals whatthis means here his human nature attains divinity at that moment god experiences what it means to be a mortal man and drinks to the dregs what he made hisfaithful servant suffer here is given the answer to job and clearly this suprememoment is as divine as it is human as eschatological as it is psychologicalpara 
jung tells us that yahweh has now become the good god but asks what
we are to make of the cautious petition inserted into the prayer lead us not intotemptation that carryover from the psalms is hardly the mark of a divine whois the summum bonum  at this point however jung contrasts the catholic and
protestant views which essentially results in freedom being seen as greater in thelatter but there is more rigidity too in that only the scriptures are regarded as theword of god catholicism with the doctrine of the holy spirit can allow furtherrevelations such as the important one of the assumptio mariae  jesus we are made
to see is not fully human and it is clear that just as man suffers from god so god
must suffer from man para  italics added it is in this way one might add
that the statement ye are gods can be realized the result of this is that manj marvin spiegelman 
himself is filled with divine conflict he himself carries the symbol of the cross
which is spirit and flesh divine and human in his own being it does not seem to
fit gods purpose to exempt man from conflict and hence from evil para  italics
added furthermore jung asks what kind of father could it be who demands thekilling of his first born as a sacrifice he is surely not the summum bonum  as in
the jewish experience it is healthier to know the opposites to fear god as well asto love him
now jung brings in the vision of ezekiel of the higher man as well as the
experience of the buddha in which there is a movement of the divine toward themortal the son of man and the reverse both god and man want to escape fromblind injustice the central idea in this jung states is the inner instability ofyahweh is the prime cause not only of the creation of the world but also of thepleromatic drama for which mankind serves as a tragic chorus    the two mainclimaxes are formed first by the job tragedy and secondly by ezekiels revelationpara 
job suffers one might say but ezekiel becomes a witness enoch becomes a
son of man in his ecstasy and comes closer also all these moments culminatesays jung in jesus who as a jewish reformer and prophet of an exclusively goodgod becomes a sacrifice to reconcile god with himself and with man this incarnation is not confined to the one man but is presaged as continual
all this cultivation of good jung shows us is brought to an enantiodromia
in the apocalypse of john para  he conjectures that the john of the epistlesis the same author as the former since the continual preaching of goodness bringsabout the change into darkness shown in the apocalypse jung also suggests thatthe more christian the consciousness the more heathen the unconscious the veryattractive heathen qualities such as the image of the divine youth and beauties ofspring are particularly missing in christianity which even developed a denial ofsexuality the chief feature of the visions however was not just a personal shadow of john but to compensate the toolight presentation of the divine thus johnsvision extended far beyond the first half of the christian aion of one thousandyears he anticipated the alchemists jacob boehme and perhaps even sensedgods birth in ordinary man which the alchemists meister eckhart and angelussilesius also intuited para  the whole outline of the dark ending of thepiscean era is suggested whose possibilities make mankind shudder jung speaksof the four horseman of the apocalypse such as the atom bomb chemical warfareand the unspeakable destruction of the holocaust there is presented the paradoxical idea of god in the apocalypse as both a savior and author in the total universal destruction god is forcing man to become conscious and unite the forcesthat assault him the tendency is to both divide and unite the need is to assimilate the dark god everything depends on man says jung the only thing thatreally matters now is whether man can climb up to a higher moral level to a higher plane of consciousness in order to be equal to the superhuman powers whichthe fallen angels have played into his hands para  in short man must knowthe self not the little self or ego but the larger totality of which he is a part thedoctrine of the assumption of mary into heaven points to a hieros gamos  a new
divine marriage which will bring about the birth of a divine child in man whichis synonymous with individuationc g jungs answer to job
jung points out in  that the evolution of consciousness has already
indicated a change in that the feminine can no longer be secondclass but requiresequality this means that a mans religion such as protestantism is not enoughand that the feminine needs to be represented in the pleroma  which is now taking
place the resulting divine birth means a process in which humanity becomes conscious of its own polaritydivinity and humanity light and dark good and evilin a total and precise way the danger in such consciousness is a terrible inflationwhich already exists on the world level among states the antidote to this inflation is this realization even the enlightened person remains what he is and isnever more than his own limited ego before the one who dwells within himwhose form has no knowable boundaries who encompasses him on all sidesfathomless as the abysms of the earth and vast as the sky para 
ii
we may now inquire whether after half a century jungs evaluation of the
evolution of the selfimage is supported or not by subsequent developments letus first consider his suggestion that the elevation of the feminine into the godheadis truly a millennial event on the outer level it is surely true as we all can seesince  women have advanced in power and recognition in every aspect of lifeeverywhere in the west and to some degree in the east as well but that has beenlargely secular does this also obtain in religious recognition
several years ago i did a study of the changes and development of the
image of mary during the last two thousand years spiegelman  i noted inthat paper that since the first appearance of the virgin to james in the year  ofour common era until  there had been a total of  different events half ofthese occurred after  and fully onethird of them had taken place since theassumptio in  clearly these visions increase in frequency as the last era ends
and the new one begins 
the content of what mary has had to say over the centuries has also under
gone significant change initially and until the early twentieth century the message was one of love compassion and healing since mary appeared to the threeshepherd children in ftima in  there have been frequently expressedrequests by her that rosaries be said by the faithful implying that human actionand prayer are necessary to change conditions on earth to bring peace for example and while mary is still usually loving and kind a note of urgency anddemand is now present as well later messages include the statement that thelord was very wroth with the sins of the world that a second world war wouldoccur that atheist russia would spread error throughout the world and at a timewhen that country had not yet become the soviet union and that several nationswould be annihilated in later appearances she continued to ask for intercessoryprayer but also told people not to worry about communist russia that she wouldtake care of that matter apparently she did it is an insufficiently noted historicalevent that an imperial communist soviet union allowed itself to be overthrownwithout necessity and that this was the essential result of one or a few powerfulmen so inclined to let it happen perhaps it was mary herself who spoke intogorbachevs ear j marvin spiegelman 
in the most recent messages mary grows even more urgent if people do not
repent the father will inflict terrible punishment on all humanity it will begreater than the deluge such as one has never seen before fire will fall from thesky and will wipe out a greater part of humanity says the madonna to sisteragnes sasagawa in japan in  see spiegelman  she goes on to say thatthe devil will penetrate everywhere even among bishops of the church alongwith this dire message however mary calls upon people to cooperate with her in saving the world she calls for a unity of heart to console both her and jesusshe says that god wishes to establish devotion to her immaculate heart in thewhole world
these messages suggest that mary not only reveals her continuing love and
care but that she has becomeas jung predictedcoequal with jesus in thatthere is a unity of heart between them she also asks for cooperation with all ofhumankind not just catholics or christians she even asks that catholics respectother religions although some church officials dispute this all this is necessaryshe states in order to soften the wrath of god at the terrible behavior of people inthe world using their freedom in devilish ways we must thus conclude that theimage of mary seen psychologically has indeed been elevated into heaven nowequal with god the father and the son and holy spirit the trinity has nowevolved into a quaternity a greater wholeness we also now realize that the masculine divinity is in agreement that the world should be devoted to her immaculate heart in the ruling images of the collective therefore this predictedassumption of importance and power of the feminine principle has been and isbeing fulfilledon earth as it is in heaven one might say psychologically
finally and most importantly we are told that as many as possible of
humankind should participate in acts of prayer and to do so in union with bothmasculine and feminine images of the divine indicating that human beings havegreat potential influence in softening divine wrath the power and significance ofthe individual in the psychic cosmos both male and female is affirmed in anextraordinary way is this not exactly what jung suggested in 
this vindication may have another unfinished side to it jungs emphasis
throughout his life was upon the need for god and human beings to grow in consciousnessthis seemed to be the reason for mans existence altogether thisfocus was also present in his seeing the aspect of the divine feminine that wasbeing revealed namely sophia or wisdom logos was his emphasis in the closing chapter of his memories dreams reflections jung  on the other hand as
an old man he deeply and powerfully acknowledged the centrality of eros and itsmystery in answer to job  however the place and importance of love in the divine
development and transformation is sparse he does speak of yahweh graduallyloosening his marital ties to the israelites but it seems that love is not the issueyet love isor becamea central issue in the development of judaism and is ofcourse of primary concern in the christianity that arose out the dynamics thatjung was writing about one wonders why he made no mention of the book of
ruth  a text in the hebrew bible bursting with the value and wonder of several
kinds of love furthermore it is this book that literally connects the messianic tradition in both judaism and christianity the messiah it affirms is to be born outof the generations of a convert ruth and will arise out of the seed of davidc g jungs answer to job
jack miles  in his god a biography  shows how love develops in the
unfolding image of the deity he says that love is not indicated as such in the bibleuntil isaiah  when
the lord begins suddenly to show an intense intimate and prior
awareness of israels fears and sorrows doubts and assumptionsthe novelty is    that the lord has become mysterious
he has been wrathful vengeful and remorseful but he has not
been loving it was not for love that he made man it was not forlove that he made the covenant with abraham it was not for lovethat he brought the israelites out of egypt or drove out thecanaanites before them the steadfast love of the mosaiccovenant was    rather a fierce mutual loyalty binding liege andvassal than any gentler emotion pp  
he has been purposeful and faithful to the covenant but not moved by the
longterm suffering of the israelites but then the face changes in second isaiah
your maker is your husband   the holy one of israel is your
redeemer   the lord has called you like a wife forsaken andgrieved in spirit like a wife of youth when she is cast off saysyour god
for a brief moment i forsook you but with great compassion i
will gather you in overflowing wrath for a moment i hid my facefrom you but with everlasting love i will have compassion foryou says the lord your redeemer isaiah  
miles continues what has happened to god that he is speaking this way
his life has surprised him when he punished israel he did not anticipate that hersorrow would lead him toward love p  referring to isaiah 
this realization of the increasing capacity for love and the expectation of this
in both god and man is i think central to the developing image of the self andsomething that one is confronted with endlessly in analytic work we discover inthat work that not only is consciousness essential but that the capacity for love asfreud also understood is also central and is developed in that process i mightadd here a contribution from that other strand in the western development of consciousness the greek when i remind us of the story of psyche and eros emerging in the later years of the grecoroman and early years of the christian erathere aphrodite becomes a teacher of love to the psycheunlike her earliermostly dangerous involvement with humansand helps the ultimate union ofpsyche with her son eros i see this parallel development of eros along with logosas carried specifically but not exclusively of course by analytic workspiegelman 
as i have discussed elsewhere spiegelman  the archetypal image of
aphrodite can be seen as the ancestress of depth psychology having entered theoffices of freud and breuer at the end of the nineteenth century along with thosej marvin spiegelman 
women suffering from hysterical symptoms that dumbfounded positivistic sci
ences understanding of the mindbody connection the development of thearchetypal feminine has been central in the depth psychological movementimpaired only by the effort in recent decades to subject psyche to rules and regulations themis instead of serving aphrodite as in the original myth becomesher regulator aphrodite along with the differentiation of her son eros may leaveanalytic institutions and societies but seems to be still present in the work of theindividual analysts
we may also note that the assumption of mary into heaven was essentially
that of the mother image although sophia as logos was also implied as jungsaid the increasing power of the feminine is revealed as essentially reflecting thematernal aspect rather than say the sexuality of mary magdalene or aphroditeeven in analytic circles it is apparent that the initial patriarchal freudian myth ofthe oedipal conflict has been superseded by the motherinfant emphasis inaugurated by melanie klein even among many jungians this myth takes precedenceover the seemingly equally relevant story of eros and psyche or the highly significant alchemical studies of jung his discussion of the transference jung certainly carries analytic understanding to a larger perspective perhaps the further development of consciousness will bring a shift from the prevailing themisorientation rules and regulations to an appreciation of artemis the feminine asindividual and for itself and the return of aphrodite in a new more differentiated way the development of mutuality and intersubjectivity in analytic work surely mirrors the archetypal opposites eg king and queen brother and sisterincluding the alchemical perspective in a more complete way spiegelman  
iii
but what about jungs emphasis on the need for the integration of the dark
and light sides of god the reconsideration of the problem of evil has the severeseparation of good and evil in the consciousness of western civilization and itsleading religion been changed certainly not politically since the mutual labelingof evil empire has been readily hurled back and forth over the last halfcenturyi believe however that the overpowering fact of the holocaustfor me the centralspiritual event of the twentieth centurywas in the background for jungs reflections in answer to job  but not addressed directly in his understanding of the devel
opment of the god image i would like to backtrack a bit in order to include a further integration of the hebrew bible and the modern jewish experience to roundout jungs view and bring it closer to the present see also spiegelman  
western religious consciousness in its patriarchal character begins with the
hebrew bible and with abraham in particular he is the chosen one to bring themonotheistic experience and belief to this consciousness which grew out of thematriarchal religions of assyria babylonia and egypt while monotheism had amodest beginning in egypt and there is significant psychological developmentevidenced in the gilgamesh myth of babylonia this is truly a freshet in the development of consciousness the differentiated polytheism of the greek psyche alsobegins here but only rather later judaism develops with the prophet moses andit is with him that chosenness by god becomes tribal the fact of the dictation c g jungs answer to job
of the bible to moses shows its general human character and origin in the book of
genesis but it becomes particular with the appearance of god to moses personally it is fulfilled however only through the commandments given to him and tothe israelites as a tribe on mt sinai about  bce
abraham is psychologically a remarkable figure he says hineni here i
amto gods call and apparently is even ready to sacrifice his son when god socommands this theme of sacrifice will be evident once again when it is jesus whois to be sacrificed as discussed below but this readiness to obey without questionor complaint changes drastically when we get to the book of job prior to thisabraham also obeys his wife sarah when she grows wroth with her maidservanthagar who has bragged about having a son when her mistress had not hagarand her son ishmael are driven out but she is assured that her seed out ofishmael will be a great nation also traditionally it is understood that the arabpeoples and subsequently islam are born out of this branch of the originalfounder so that abraham is indeed the father of the three monotheisms in thewest it is noteworthy that when sarah hears of the neardeath of her beloved sonisaac she becomes very ill and soon dies this shock too much for a loving mother is repeated a millennium and a half later in the experience by mary of the crucifixion of her son jesus isaac one of the fathers of judaism remains rather inthe background henceforth in contrast to his father abraham and to his sonsjacob and esau this no doubt is because of that great shock to him too whichoccurred not when he was a child but when he was a man near  yet it is he whois required to pass on the birthright to the eldest of his twin sons esau and isdeceived both by his younger son jacob and by his wife rebecca she remarkably is told by god that jacob should and would be the heir of the chosennessas priests of god although esau would be also be the father of a mighty nationcontinuing the path of ishmael in some stories and of other nations also so thewomanthe mother and the femininecontinues to hear and pass on the voiceof the divine among the hebrews just as did sarah and eve before her
while abraham is totally loyal and true without questioning his god isaac
is nearly wiped out by his experience of the divine and with his father jacobalthough devious may be said to more fully carry on both an individuating experience and be a spokesperson for his people he is the one who has the vision ofthe ladder of ascension into heaven with angels circulating upon it and it is hewho struggles with the angel of god all night he thereby achieves the properblessing on his own making up for his theft from esau of such specialness bygod jacob then may be the succeeding conscious carrier of this path of chosenness and by extension of his new name israel he who struggles withgod to all of the israelites
so when we come to the experience of moses several generations later leav
ing out for the moment the role of jacobs brother sons and in particular josephthe defining moment is not the crossing of the sea of reeds where all are chosento be saved but when he delivers the commandments given by god to all theisraelites at mt sinai the hebrew bible has it numbers  that there were people present at that time and that the souls of all the jewish people bornsince then were also present in some form to receive this transmission of divinedirection on how to live life in relation to god and what this means it is also traj marvin spiegelman 
ditional to understand that all  received the torah and that there are thus
 possible interpretations this means that a collective or tribal consciousness was involved but an individual one as well with the birth of christianitywe go from the  who received the calling at sinai to the one who hearsthe voice of god from nazareth onwards the message is an individual one andjesus could readily be seen as someone who encourages individual salvation andtherefore is closer to conscious individuation as jung describes it in the christianstory the jews were responsible for the son of gods death they killed god or atleast did not stand up for their own messiah thus they merited the subsequentrejection and persecution christians understood this as a proper retributionwhile christians themselves became the chosen people as this myth begins tochange with the enlightenment and the broader perspective of science and philosophy by the later th and th centuries the power of the story diminishes formany people instead with the appearance of nazismmaking itself present in anominally christian people with its paganism and wotanism underneathitwould appear that god too permits the killing of the jews  of themsince they killed his son but this holocaust also shows the dark side of godhe either killed them or let them be killed unjustly
one might consider that whereas the original condition was that of the
many israelites giving way to the one jesus the movement now goes from theone jesus who has experienced the divine most deeply to the many the six million who also did so but in a shockingly dark and unjust fashion thus the stories of job and jesus are repeated the innocents are put into the hands of the darkside now perhaps the presence of the many is not just the continuing chosenness of israel and the jews as god promised nor only the continuation ofchristian specialness and uniqueness thanks to jesus but that once more thegroup is emphasized it is the group that is visited darkly and now perhaps thegroup is to be subsequently visited from the light side redemption is to be forthe collective as well as the individual the book of revelation after all also suggested that the end days would see the saving and elevation into heaven of souls jung brought consciousness of individuation as the path of findingthe divine within which was also the message of jesus and now perhaps thegroup experience of both the divine within and among can take place or asi have described it spiegelman  there is god within god between mutual process in analysis love god among ritual observance and god aroundnature art music synchronicity
consider a further aspect of the symbolism of six the many ideas in
jewish thought about cycles and messianic expectation also revolve about the calendar itself we are now in the year   ce anticipating thegreat change expected to occur in the year  the universe is said to have beencreated at the outset of this year cycle which can also be seen as in the sixdays of creation of the world as symbolic of larger timescales or events is it notpossible to consider that the foregoing ideas about the six might also find theirculmination not only in the year cycle of christianity and of astrology butalso in the year cycle of judaism that the new age for the whole of creation could take place some  years from now is not such a bad predictionshould we listen to jungs reflections on these processes c g jungs answer to job
it may also be noteworthy that the symbolism of six involves both duality
and the triad continuing the dynamic nature of recent history it may be that thewholeness suggested by the quaternity and the sphere are still projected into thatfuture time perhaps preceded by the continuing development of wholeness inindividuals and perhaps small groups
iv
what remains now is to consider the most recent international experience of
the problem of evil as evidenced in the quarrel among the monotheisms afterbroiling for some time the battle among the myths of judaism christianity islamand scientific rationalist materialism has come fully into focus since the horrificimage on  of the suicidehomicide muslim bombers crashing into thetwin towers of new york and the pentagon jung had mentioned in passingthat he felt the spirit of islam in the military passion of the nazis without castingany aspersion on the religion of islam itself rather he sensed that passion armedwith divine mission something missing from the west for some time was a primitive invasion of soulless europe
that in itself was prescient but when we consider that the muslim terror
ists aimed their venom at a symbol of western might we can see that the powerthey attacked was the mercantile rationalist scientific nonreligious myth thatthey despised they do not bomb christian churches in contrast to synagoguesand mostly want all western materialism out of the muslim world our responsehowever is more complex we embrace the values of the goddess of reasonnamely democracy tolerance and the separation of church and state but underneath that more modern commitment is the continuation of the crusades a western general proclaims that his christian god is stronger than that of the enemy andour president prides himself on being a bornagain christian in that sense thenthe old battle of christian versus muslim as well as muslim versus jew continues it is true that the ancient war of the christian against the jew has been vastlyalleviated thanks to the experience of the holocaust i would imagine with thecatholic church in the forefront of this reparation protestant churches are a bitslower in such reconciliation eg presbyterian animosity toward israel but theyare in no sense more hostile than the left and right of the european rationalistintellectuals fewer than  of europeans ever attend church aside from italyand ireland in contrast to  in the united states while over  of americansprofess faith in god we proclaim the values of the founding fathers a kind ofbenevolent deism but  million copies of books proclaiming and describing theend days and armageddon have been sold in the united states over the last tenyears on the other hand the hatred among muslims toward the jew equals thatof the nazis with israel becoming the contemporary focus for traditional antisemitism judaism meanwhile tries to realize the ancient dream of homeland aspromised by god whether secular or religious
are these warring strands all part of the mind of god we might ask fol
lowing jung i think that we can see it this way now jung also saw the interplayof archetypal forces played out at a political level we witness the shadow andlight of each of our western religious traditions including the rationalscientificj marvin spiegelman 
informing the nations and regions as jung saw nations now carry the inflation of
certainty of their rightness as the faiths always have but the clash of opposites isvisibly and horribly demonstrated in the crash into the twin towers and in thesuicide bombers in the middle east islam never having had the enlightenmentwhich brought democracy civil rights and individuality to the west as well asthe less attractive mercantilism and secularism attacked the overarching evenhubristic symbol of those towers along with their human occupants this can beseen as a negative coniunctio  with a possible more positive union in the future
perhaps bringing these valuable qualities to the muslim states as the unitedstates proclaims it wishes to do perhaps islamic passion and the capacity for submission to the divine which the word islam connotes will also affect us particularly our rationalist hubris
the shadow side of the united states however including our greed excess
aggressiveness and righteousness finds its foe in the islamic shadow of violenceand intolerance as well as even more inflated righteousness this battle of theopposites each of which feels itselfas monotheisms doto be the truth canbe seen as different aspects of the divine oneness who has chosen all of them atvarious times their increasing interaction may indeed be due to the end time inwhich the new ageor no agetakes place christians expect a second comingjews the messiah and the muslim savior is the twelfth imam named mehdi allof whom appear when corruption and chaos are at their worst hence evil is central to all three monotheisms secular scientific rationalism has had many utopian schemes over the last two centuries but the myth relies on the advancement ofknowledge and technology to the degree that humanity can recreate itself andwithout acknowledging god science becomes the creator itself considering theadvances in genetics biological sciences and technology that aim is no longeronly a distant dream
how then will these strands in the western and mideastern psyche aspects
of the self reconcile or annihilate each other and what does god intend i wouldoffer that this new kind of world war is part of that larger struggle in whichjungs and others vision of the one world is gradually coming into being however slowly and painfully and that means that the asian religions the polytheism of hinduism and the nontheistic religion of buddhism as well as the animism of africa are ultimately to be included in our one world marielouise vonfranz perhaps jungs most gifted pupil believed that unless christianity wasable to integrate the divine mercurial stratum of the psyche discovered by depthpsychology as revealed in alchemy it was likely to be totally relativized
all this is of great challenge to the traditional monotheistic orientation and asks
for integration the one divine in multiple aspects has been experienced by manyindividuals in dreams such as the famous one of max zeller in which people allover the world were building the new temple zeller  jung acknowledged tozeller that he had seen many such dreams and avowed that this would occur inabout  years so we have another numerical time frame of a coming unificationand then perhaps if we have not destroyed each other the monotheistic god alongwith its divisions and oppositions will find its fulfillment in a new world myth
that anticipated wholeness can also be imagined in our increasing use of the
term planet beginning with the vision of the earth as seen from the moon not c g jungs answer to job
so long ago and by the earlier vision of jung in a neardeath experience when he
glimpsed both this sphere and the wonderful blue around it it may also receivesymbolic support from science in that a new fusiontype nuclear reactorin contrast to the fission atom splitting reactors we have been struggling with for halfa centuryis being built in france under the aegis of a manynation consortiumthis anticipated wholeness one hopes will include the achievements of individuation and enlightened group membership in its totality but before the mysteryof the divine we can like jung remain aware that we are only our limited egosbefore the one who encompasses us on all sides

several anonymous critics have responded to this paper in an earlier draft
and the editor has been kind enough to send these to me for comment
one person believed me to be too contained in jewish psychology thus
writing out of metaphysical or ideological or political containment i supposethis was because i mentioned that a jew like me took pause at jungs astonishing insight but perhaps the use of jewish material as well as the number symbolism which others also questioned contributed this judgment would astonish members of my psychoecumenical group meeting for over twenty years andcomprising a buddhist priest a catholic priest two nuns an orthodox rabbi anepiscopal priest a protestant minister and occasional visitors of other faiths all ofwhom are therapists with me as the only clerically lay person it might also surprise those who have read my many books authored or coauthored or edited onthe relationship of jungian psychology to buddhism judaism catholicismprotestantism and to sufismislam which i have prided myself as thinking iwrote from the experience of these faiths from inside psychologically and notmerely as an outsider to them i can only also suggest that i was simply tellingsomething about my personal origins just as jung did when acknowledging hisbackground was christian i presume that we are all analyzed and psychologically oriented and to that extent not contained in any myth other than our ownindividual one hence when speaking about god or the godimage i am referring like jung to the psychological images emerging from the unconscious and iam not positing the objective truth of any of these are we not we jungiansengaged in the work with psychic reality but perhaps this critic was put off bythe emphasis on the jewish experience and number symbolism i brought thisaspect forward since i think that jung was less inclusive in this way and this wasalso the opinion of the jesuit jack miles and because the holocaust seemed to meto be of overwhelming significance but i trust that i did not overdo this focus andi believe that i was still quite connected to jungs work and attitude
this critic and two others also thought that i was too speculative with my
intuitions about number etc and that i was not sufficiently grounded wheresthe beef asked one and another thought i was being theological or theosophical i admit to the speculative intuition but reject the other judgment since i placemyself firmly in the psychological imaginal camp just as jung did as to thebeef i prefer a statement that what i presented was not this persons cup oftea which i can surely understandj marvin spiegelman 
the symbolism of the six has leapt out at me for many years in the ways i
mentioned eg holocaust numbers sinai etc and i approach this number symbolism just as jung did in aion and elsewhere as an archetypal expression of how
the unconscious structures experience and events i might have added otheritems such as the sixday war experienced by many as numinous or even miraculous the sixsided star of david six days of creation etc if the intuitions i putforward are not convincing then so be it i do not assert truth in this way ioffered my own since they were striking for me and nobody has put forward otherintuitions or analyses about answer to job or the subsequent events of our time
relating to jungs intuitions sensate types will be unconvinced of course as wellas other intuitives who have yet to express their own views what i assert againhowever since this seems to be overlooked is that all of us are speaking about theimaginal psychic reality which is crucial for jungian thought as it also is in thevarious mysticisms it was from this perspective that i also presented the quipabout mary speaking into gorbachevs ear it was not funny for one critic andapparently was not seen in its psychological intention either
the most extensiveand valuablecriticism came from one person who
also found the number symbolism too literal i need to remind all of us that theinterplay between psychic reality and physical reality is interpenetrating and variable i call attention to the intuition jung had in his last years that the world wouldundergo terrific devastation from his experience of his first deep immersion inthe unconscious seeing blood overcome europe except for switzerland and laterseeing the effect of world war i jung often brought the two kinds of realitytogether it is true that we never know to what extent the symbol becomes concrete or literal but we try to hold these opposites together creatively do we not
this same critic took issue with my mention of aphrodite in the consulting
room which was seen as bad hillman this person also did not like my statement that the development of the archetypal feminine has been central in thedepth psychological movement impaired only by the effort in recent decades tosubject everything to rules and regulations to this critic this sounded like arationalization for sexual acting out on the part of analysts individuated enoughto resist collective moral sanctions this person sees aphrodite i believe from aperspective different from my own that aphrodite is the one who sanctions adark eros just waiting for the opportunity for lust to triumph the aspect i had inmind however belongs to the psycheeros myth of our current aion in whichpsyche has to undergo tests and transformation under the hands of aphrodite inorder to ultimately unite with her son eros and achieve wholeness the otherview of course is the very one that many in our society seem to embrace and itseems to me illustrative of the very triumph of themis over aphrodite ratherthan serving her in the way that i have suggested but i understand the fear andconcern for this involves the very darkness in the divine principle now on thefeminine side that jung was writing about
this person also took issue with my focusing on the western monotheisms
i fully understand this in light of the slowly emerging world myth i was writing about but i was writing about answer to job and that book was certainly deal
ing with the judaeochristian tradition incidentally jungs is one of the very fewbooks that can truly combine these in my opinion it looks as if there is still so c g jungs answer to job
much to accomplish in the union of just the western monotheisms including the
rationalscientific one that the larger perspective will surely take more timethat was surely jungs intent with his vision he is supposed to have said whenreading kabbalah and when reading chan buddhism on is death bed that heaverred that each of these paths was it
this leads to this same critic questioning how my work can really add to
jungs vision of how human consciousness can change god and what the newrelation between the human being and god might look like rather than what weend up with now a series of scattered and tired insights into the evolution of religions i agree wholeheartedly about the first part anyway it seems to me as ihave said that we are gradually seeing not only the opposites in the divine asjung has shown so creatively but also the multiplicity of images that are at warwith each other it is in this sense that i put forward the idea that the basic quarrel is between the one and the many we are gradually being required to facewithin ourselves and within the world that we need to endure this kind of conflict in the divine image so that a new world myth can emerge the conflictingmyths i fear may need to get played out i pray that the armageddon aspect willnot need to be literal but the extent to which we are able to tolerate this multiplicity along with unity will determine whether humankind can truly surviveand flourish rather than simply destroy itself it is here that the fantasies of a newtechnological age or new species etc begin to flourish i for one prefer to staywith the task at hand hinting at the future possibility but siding with those whocontinue to work on such conflicts within between and among
