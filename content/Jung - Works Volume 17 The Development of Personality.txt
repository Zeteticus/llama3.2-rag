observations of a yearold childs curiosity about and eventual discovery of the facts of life are the 
basis for a discussion of the devel opment of sexuality in children a lthough a scientific explanation of 
the mechanics of birth was presented to the child she preferred her own fant asies which involved the 
use of sublimation compensation logical reasoning and myth making in explaining this preference for 
fantasy it is suggested that the scientific presenta tion restricted the developm ent of the thinking function 
whereas the fantasies stimulated it the freudian interp retation of infantile sexuality as sexuality pure 
and simple is presented and debated as a replac ement for the freudian theory of polymorphous 
perverse a theory of a polyvale nt disposition is proposed to e xplain the origin of the thinking 
function according to the freudian view the th inking function develops out of sexual curiosity 
according to the theory of polyvalent disposition the development of the thinking function coincides 
with sexual curiosity reducing the origins of thought to  mere sexuality is considered to be antithetical 
to the basic facts of human psychology  references

the study of mrs wickes inner world of childhood  is recommended as an aid to understanding the 
effects of the parental unconscious in the psychic development of  children the difficulties in child
rearing outlined in the introduction are examined in th e light of the thesis that the unexamined portions 
of the unconscious psyches of parent s can cause psychic disorders in th eir children to cope with this 
problem parents are urged to develop a profound se lfknowledge the collective unconscious is also 
seen as an important factor in the child psyche prior to the development of ego consciousness the 
dreams of very young children contain a high incide nce of mythological symbolism evidence the 
perennial content existing in the human soul a nd passed from generation to generation after the 
development of ego consciousness a small portion of  this collective unconscious survives and is 
considered as the mysterious spiritus rector of  our weightiest deeds and our individual destiny  
 child development and education  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  
princeton university press   p p   
a brief history of analytic psychology is provided as a basis for examining the role of the school in the 
development of the psyche an analysis of the difference between freudian psychoanalysis and analytic 
psychology reveals that the former recognizes only the sexual instinct as a cause of nervous disorders 
whereas the latter maintains that other factors in cluding the parental unconsci ous play important roles 
in the development of both the normal and abnormal personality in applying the biogenetic law that 
ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny to the development of  the psyche four stages are noted animal 
unconsciousness identification with the family primitive intelligence  and finally civilized individual 
awareness the individual psyche that  develops between the ages of three and five when the child first 
grasps the significance of l doe s not gain a significant degree of  independence from instinct and 
environment until after puberty consequently the infl uence of the parental unconscious on the childs 
unconscious and the childs identification with the fami ly lasts well into the ea rly school years schools 
therefore serve an important psychol ogical function in that they assist  the child in freeing himself from 
unconscious identification with the family there by allowing him to become  properly conscious of 
himself since this t ype of education is basicall y psycholo gical it is transmitted in lar ge part throu gh 
the example of the teacher who must  present a model of healthy behavi or to the child because teachers 
are so influential in developing th e childs psyche they are urged to  gain a deeper selfunderstanding by 
making use of methods of dr eam analysis  reference

a brief outline of the development of psychology is  provided and its major acc omplishments  dream 
analysis the discovery of the uncons cious and the role of the unconsci ous in mental disorders  are 
listed a knowledge of analytic psychology and dream analysis is r ecommended to educators who wish 
to understand their pupils since the findings of abnor mal psychology illuminate normal behavior five 
case studies of disturbed children are used to illu strate the five main groups  of psychic disturbances 
backward children psychopathic ch ildren epileptic children and th e various forms of psychotic and 
neurotic children in addition becaus e the analysis of children is difficult educators are urged to view 
such constructs as the oedipus comp lex figuratively not lite rally and to reject freuds theory that the 
relationship between parent and ch ild is primarily sexual instead of regarding the childs sexual 
longings for its parents as a primary causal factor of ne urosis it is suggested th at the repressed material 
in the parents unconscious causes ne urosis in the parent which in turn radiates out to the childs 
unconscious neurotic states are thus passed from ge neration to generation via contagion it is proposed 
that this situation be remedied by having parents willingl y face the repressed material in their own 
unconscious  references

the psychological hypotheses of freud and adler are analyzed and cont rasted with the methods aims 
and purposes of analytic psychology freuds theory ba sed on the ramifications of the sexual instinct in 
the human psyche and adlers concept of selfprese rvation are both rejected as explanations of the 
ultimate causes of human behavior because such single broad hypotheses ignore complexities the 
differences between the jungian and freudian con cepts of psychic development are illustrated by 
reference to religion and to parent child relationships scientific  psychology is then examined and 
judged to be both a human and a natural science by virt ue of its subject matter and methodology its role 
among the sciences is to investigate the investiga tive tool itself in res ponse to those critics who 
maintain that due to the arbitrary nature of the ego the subject matte r of psychology is beyond scientific 
study it is argued that the psyche in relation to consciousness is preexistent and transcendent 
attention is given to the aim of analytic psychology namely to understand life as it appears in the 
human soul in order to help the individual to adapt hi s behavior to the demands of external life and to 
those of his own being to accomplis h this goal the investigative methods of association symptom 
analysis anamnestic analysis and the analysis of th e unconscious are suggested as means of probing the 
unknown in the patient the first two methods are only briefly described while the second two are 
presented in detail and illustrated by several examples  references

theories concerning the causes of neurosis are exam ined with a distinction made between suppression 
and repression the tendency to expl ain every neurosis in terms of repression of infantile sexuality is 
rejected because it neglects the individuals willingness to re press discordant knowledge and 
experiences and interprets neurosis as having its causes in the di stant past or in present cultural 
conditions consequently instead of a doctrinaire freudian approach to psychotherapy it is suggested 
that each case be treated accordin g to its own peculiarities in order to justify this latter a pproach four 
case histories two of which are mirror opposites are presented further enlightenment about the causes 
of neurosis is derived from an an alysis of the compositi on of the unconscious it is theorized that the 
unconscious has two parts the pers onal and the collective the contents of the personal unconscious 
consist of everything forgotten or repressed by the individual conscious ly or unconsciously those of the 
collective unconscious consist of the structural de posits of psychic activitie s that were repeated 
innumerable times in the lives of our ancestors  although neither the conscious mind nor the personal 
unconscious is usually aware of the existence of the collective unconscious material from the collective 
unconscious will occasionally break through into th e personal unconscious by means of a dream with 
mythological content and meaning that is beyond the intellectual horizons of the individual

 the gifted child  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  princeton university 
press   p p   
the education and the most benefici al means of developing the psyche of the gifted child are discussed 
the fact that schools too often neglec t the gifted child in their preocc upation with educating the slow is 
not considered harmful to the former since genius  unlike talent can neither be hindered nor helped 
however grouping school children according to ability is considered detrimental to the gifted child 
insofar as the gift of genius in one intellectual area  is often balanced by inferiority in another such 
grouping would produce onesided produc ts and would deprive the gifted child of the beneficial moral 
effects of observing that average children are his bett ers in certain areas the development of the childs 
psyche is influenced more by the warmth and pers onal example of the individual teacher than by the 
school curriculum within the curriculum the hum anities are recommended over the sciences in 
developing the child because it is believed that they  inculcate the sense of cultural continuity and form 
the bridge between the past and the future  
 the significance of the uncon scious in individual education  in jung c collected works of 
c g jung vol  princeton univer sity press   p p   
three types of education are pres ented and dream analysis is discussed as an aid to individual 
education the first of the three types education through example is considered the basis for all 
education deriving its strength fr om the phenomenon of psychic iden tity collective education the 
second type is based on principles methods and rules and has as its aim the checking of the 
antisocial impulses in man if stude nts resist collective education becau se of attitudes acquired at home 
that render them unfit for collective education the third type individual education is required it is here 
that dream analysis is recommended since the ch ilds consciousness develops from the unconscious 
state it is understandable that earl y environmental influences often re side in the unconscious and remain 
unchanged by collective education si nce dreams arc the product of unc onscious psychic activity dream 
analysis is seen as a vehicle for bringing to th e light of consciousness the hidden contents of the 
unconscious that must be changed as an example of the therapeutic benefits th at can be derived from 
dream analysis a case history including th e analysis of two dreams is provided  
 the development of personality  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  
princeton university press   p p   
me origin development purpose and compone nts of personality are examined and discussed 
personality defined as the individua lization of the objective psyche shared by all men is developed by 
submitting to the personal law of ones own being this  personal law is likened to a vocation or an inner 
voice that calls one from the life of the herd to an individual life only th e man who can consciously 
assent to the power of this inne r voice becomes a personality though  the term inner voice is used 
figurativel y it is intended to re present a powerful psychic factor that has an ob jective existence the call 
of this inner voice is not seen as completely pl easant both great evil and great good are contained 
therein the negative aspects of this force are illu strated by reference to the gospel account of the 
temptation of christ by the devil myths that presen t the threatening forces surrounding the birth of the 
hero and the heroic life are seen as expressions of an awareness of the dangers surrounding the attempt 
to become a personality failure to heed the inner law of ones being how ever is considered to result in 
condemning one to ignorance concerning the purpose of ones life in  classical chinese philosophy this 
psychic law is expressed through the concept of tao an interior way likened to  the flow of water and 
considered as the source of fulfil lment it is concluded that because  of the resemblance between the tao 
and the psychic state resulting from  individuation personality may be  defined as tao  reference  
 marriage as a psychological relationship  in jung  c collected works of c g jung vol 
 princeton university pres s   p p   
the effect of the psychological de velopment that occurs in marriage partners during middleage is 
discussed and the resultant change in the marital relationship is analyzed prior to middleage the 
marital relationship is governed by bi ological imperatives at middle ag e the force of th ese imperatives 
diminishes and the partners are free to become themselves this  transformation influences the 
psychological relationship of marriage since changes occur in the roles that the partners have played it 
is considered likely that marita l friction will develop during this transformation process since the 
confusion that accompanies growth breeds feelings of disunity and discontent if  the real cause of the 
difficulty is not recognize d each of the partners may hold the other responsible for the discontent in 
addition the different need s of each partner complicate this gr owth period a detailed explanation of 
these changing needs is presented and it is observe d that usually a woman feels wholly contained 
spiritually in her husband and the man wholly cont ained emotionally in hi s wife  references
