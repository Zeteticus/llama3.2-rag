the nautis project      on life after death 
by cg jung        
what i have to tell about the hereafter and about life after death consists 
entirely of memories of im ages in which i have lived and of thoughts which 
have buffeted me these memories in a way also underlie my works for the 
latter are fundamentally nothing but attempts ever re newed to give an answer 
to the question of the interplay be tween the here and the hereafter yet i 
have never written expressly about a life after death for then i would have had 
to document my ideas and i have no way of doing that be that as it may i 
would like to state my ideas now  
even now i can do no more than tell stories mythologize perhaps one has to 
be close to death to acquire the necessary freedom to talk about it it is not 
that i wish we had a life after death in fact i would prefer not to foster such 
ideas still i must state to give reality its due that without my wishing and 
without my doing anything about it thoughts of this nature move about within 
me i cant say whether these thoughts are true or false but i do know they are 
there and can be given utterance if i do not repress them out of some 
prejudice prejudice cripples and injures th e full phenomenon of psychic life 
and i know too little about psychic life to feel that i can set it right out of 
superior knowledge critical rationalism has ap parently eliminated along with 
so many other mythic con ceptions the idea of life after death this could only 
have happened because nowadays most people identify themselves almost 
exclusively with their consciousness and imagine that they are only what they 
know about themselves yet anyone with even a smatte ring of psychology can 
see how limited this knowledge is rationalism and doctrinairism  are the disease 
of our time they pretend to have all the answers but a great deal will yet be 
discovered which our present limited view would have ruled out as imposs ible 
our concepts of space and time have only approximate validity and there is 
therefore a wide field for minor and major deviations in view of all this i lend 
an attentive ear to the strange myths of the psyche and take a careful look at 
the varied events that come my way regardless of whether or not they fit in 
with my theoretical postulates  
the nautis project   unfortunately the mythic side of man is given short shrift nowadays he can no 
longer create fables as a result a great deal escapes him for it is importa nt 
and salutary to speak also of incomprehensible things such talk is like the 
telling of a good ghost story as we sit by the fireside and smoke a pipe  
what the myths or stories about a life after death really mean or what kind of 
reality lies behind t hem we certainly do not know we cannot tell whether they 
possess any validity be yond their indubitable value as anthropomorphic 
projections rather we must hold clearly in mind that there is no possible way 
for us to attain certainty concerning things which pass our understanding  
we cannot visualize another world ruled by quite other laws the reason being 
that we live in a specific world which has helped to shape our minds and 
establish our basic psychic conditions we are strictly limited by our inna te 
structure and therefore bound by our whole being and thinking to this world of 
ours mythic man to be sure demands a going beyond all that but scientific 
man cannot permit this to the intellect all my mythologizing  is futile 
speculation to the e motions how ever it is a healing and valid activity it gives 
existence a glamour which we would not like to do without nor is there any 
good reason why we should  
parapsychology holds it to be a scientifically valid proof of an afterlife that the 
dead manifest themselves either as ghosts or through a medium and 
communicate things which they alone could possibly know but even though 
there do exist such well documented cases the question remains whether the 
ghost or the voice  is identical with the dead person or is a psychic projection 
and whether the things said really derive from the deceased or from knowledge 
which may be present in the un conscious   
leaving aside the rational arguments against any certainty in these matt ers we 
must not forget that for most people it means a great deal to assume that their 
lives will have an in definite continuity beyond their present existence they live 
more sensibly feel better and are more at peace one has cen turies one has 
an inconceivable period of time at ones disposal what then is the point of this 
senseless mad rush  
naturally such reasoning does not apply to everyone there are people who feel 
no craving for immortality and who shud der at the thought of sitting on a clo ud 
and playing the harp for ten thousand years there are also quite a few who 
have been so buffeted by life or who feel such disgust for their own existence 
that they far prefer absolute cessation to continu ance but in the majority of 
cases the questi on of immortality is so urgent so immediate and also so 
ineradicable that we must make an effort to form some sort of view about it 
                                                           
 concerning absolute knowledge in the unconscious cf synchronicity an acausal connecting principle in the 
structure and dynamics of the psyche cwppiff 
the nautis project   but how  
my hypothesis is that we can do so with the aid of hints sent to us from the 
unconscious in dreams for example  usually we dismiss these hints because we 
are convinced that the question is not susceptible to answer in response to this 
understandable skepticism i suggest the following considerations if there is 
something we cannot know we must necessarily abando n it as an intellectual 
problem for example i do not know for what reason the universe has come i nto 
being and shall never know  
therefore i must drop this question as a scientific or intellectual problem but if 
an idea about it is offered to me in dreams or in mythic traditions i ought to 
take note of i t i even ought to build up a conception on the basis of such hints 
even though it will forever remain a hypothesis which i know cannot be proved  
a man should be able to say he has done his best to form a conception of life 
after death or to create some  image of it  even if he must confess his failure 
not to have done so is a vital loss for the question that is posed to him is the 
ageold heritage of humanity an archetype rich in secret life which seeks to 
add itself to our own individual life in or der to make it whole reason sets the 
boundaries far too narrowly for us and would have us accept only the known 
and that too with limitations and live in a known framework just as if we 
were sure how far life actually extends as a matter of fact day after day we 
live far beyond the bounds of our consciousness without our knowledge the life 
of the unconscious is also going on within us the more the critical reason 
dominates the more impov erished life becomes but the more of the 
unconscious and t he more of myth we are capable of making conscious the 
more of life we integrate overvalued reason has this in common with political 
absolutism under its dominion the individual is pau perized  
the unconscious helps by communicating things to us or mak ing figurative 
allusions it has other ways too of informing us of things which by all logic we 
could not possibly know consider synchronistic phenomena premonitions and 
dreams that come true i recall one time during the second world war when i 
was returning home from bollingen  i had a book with me but could not read 
for the moment the train started to move i was overpowered by the image of 
someone drowning this was a memory of an accident that had happened while i 
was on military service during the entire journey i could not rid myself of it it 
struck me as uncanny and i thought what has happened can there have been 
an accident  
i got out at erienbach  and walked home still troubled by this memory my 
second daughters children were in the garden the family was living with us 
having returned to  switzerland from paris because of the war the children 
stood looking rather upset and when i asked why what is the matter  they 
told me that adrian then the youngest of the boys had fallen into the water in 
the nautis project   the boathouse  it is quite deep there and since he could not really swim he had 
almost drowned his older brother had fished him out this had taken place at 
exactly the time i had been assailed by that memory in the train the uncon 
scious had given me a hint why should it not be able to inform me of other 
things also  
i had a somewhat similar experience before a death in my wifes family i 
dreamed that my wifes bed was a deep pit with stone walls it was a gra ve and 
somehow had a suggestion of classical antiquity about it then i heard a deep 
sigh as if someone were giving up the ghost a figure that resembled my wife 
sat up in the pit and floated upward it wore a white gown into which curious 
black symbols were woven i awoke roused my wife and checked the time it 
was three oclock in the morn ing the dream was so curious that i thought at 
once that it might signify a death at seven oclock came the news that a cousin 
of my wife had died at three ocloc k in the morning  
frequently foreknowledge is there but not recognition thus i once had a dream 
in which i was attending a garden party i saw my sister there and that greatly 
surprised me for she had died some years before a deceased friend of mine 
was also present the rest were people who were still alive presently i saw that 
my sister was accompanied by a lady i knew well even in the dream i had drawn 
the conclusion that the lady was going to die she is already marked i thought 
in the dream i knew exactly who she was i knew also that she lived in basel 
but as soon as i woke up i could no longer with the best will in the world recall 
who she was although the whole dream was still vivid in my mind i pictured all 
my acquaintances in basel to see whether the memory images would ring a bell 
nothing  
a few weeks later i received news that a friend of mine had had a fatal 
accident i knew at once that she was the person i had seen in the dream but 
had been unable to identify my recollection o f her was perfectly clear and 
richly detailed since she had been my patient for a considerable time up to a 
year before her death in my attempt to recall the person in my dream 
however hers was the one picture which  did not appear in my portrait gallery of 
basel acquaintances although by rights it should have been one of the first  
when one has such experiences and i will tell of others like them one acquires 
a certain respect for the potentialities and arts of the unconscious only one 
must remain critical and be aware that such communications may have a 
subjective mean ing as well they may be in accord with reality and then again 
they may not i have however learned that the views i have been able to form 
on the basis of such hints from the uncon scious have been most rewarding 
naturally i am not going to write a book of revelations about them but i will 
acknowledge that i have a myth which encourages me to look deeper into this 
whole realm myths are the earliest form of science when i speak of things 
after death i am speaking out of inner prompt ing and can go no farther than to 
the nautis project   tell you dreams and myths that relate to this subject  
naturally one can contend from the start that myths and dreams concer ning 
continuity of life after death are merely compensating fantasies which are 
inherent in our natures all life desires eternity the only argument i can adduce 
in answer to this is the myth itself  
however there are indications that at least a part of t he psyche is not subject 
to the laws of space and time scientific proof of that has been provided by the 
wellknown j b rhine experiments  along with numerous cases of spontaneous 
foreknowledge non spatial perceptions and so on of which i have given  a 
number of examples from my own life these experi ments prove that the psyche 
at times functions outside of the spatio temporal law of causality this indicates 
that our con ceptions of space and time and therefore of causality also are 
incomplete a c omplete picture of the world would require the addition of still 
another dimension only then could the totality of phenomena be given a unified 
explanation hence it is that the rationalists insist to this day that 
parapsychological  experiences do not really exist for their world view stands or 
falls by this question if such phenomena occur at all the rationalistic picture of 
the universe is inv alid because incomplete then the possibility of an other 
valued reality behind the phenomenal world becomes an inescapable problem 
and we must face the fact that our world with its time space and causality 
relates to another order of things lying be hind or beneath it in which neither 
here and there nor earlier and later are of impor tance i have been convinced 
that at least a part of our psychic existence is characterized by a relativity of 
space and time this relativity seems to increase in proportion to the distance 
from consciousness to an absolute condition of timelessness  and spacelessness  
not only my own dreams but also occasionally the dreams of others helped to 
shape revise or confirm my views on a life after death i attach part icular 
importance to a dream which a pupil of mine a woman of sixty dreamed about 
two months before her death she had entered the hereafter there was a class 
going on and various deceased women friends of hers sat on the front bench an 
atmosphere of general expectation pre vailed she looked around for a teacher 
or lecturer but could find none then it became plain that she herself was the 
lecturer for immediately after death people had to give accounts of the total 
experience of their lives the de ad were extremely inter ested in the life 
experiences that the newly deceased brought with them just as if the acts and 
experiences taking place in earthly life in space and time were the decisive 
ones  
in any case the dream describes a most unusual au dience whose like could 
scarcely be found on earth people burningly interested in the final 
psychological results of a human life that was in no way remarkable any more 
                                                           
 extrasensory perception boston  the reach of the mind new york  
the nautis project   than were the conclusions that could be drawn from it to our way of thinking 
if however the audience existed in a state of relative non time where 
termination event and development had become questionable concepts 
they might very well be most interested precisely in what was lacking in their 
own condition  
at the time of th is dream the lady was afraid of death and did her best to fend 
off any thoughts about it yet death is an important interest especially to an 
aging person a categorical question is being put to him and he is under an 
obligation to answer it to this end he ought to have a myth about death for 
reason shows him nothing but the dark pit into which he is descending myth 
however can conjure up other images for him helpful and enriching pictures of 
life in the land of th e dead if he believes in them or greets them with some 
measure of credence he is being just as right or just as wrong as some one who 
does not believe in them but while the man who de spairs marches toward 
nothingness the one who has placed his faith  in the archetype follows the 
tracks of life and lives right into his death both to be sure remain in 
uncertainty but the one lives against his instincts the other with them  
the figures from the unconscious are uninformed too and need man or contac t 
with consciousness in order to attain to knowledge when i began working with 
the unconscious i found myself much involved with the figures of salome and 
elijah then they receded but after about two years they reap peared to my 
enormous astonishment  they were completely unchanged they spoke and acted 
as if nothing had happened in the meanwhile in actuality the most incredible 
things had taken place in my life i had as it were to begin from the be ginning 
again to tell them all about what had b een going on and explain things to 
them at the time i had been greatly surprised by this situation only later did i 
understand what had happened in the interval the two had sunk back into the 
unconscious and into themselves i might equally well put it  into timelessness 
they remained out of contact with the ego and the egos changing 
circumstances and therefore were ig norant of what had happened in the world 
of consciousness  
quite early i had learned that it was necessary for me to in struct the fig ures of 
the unconscious or that other group which is often indistinguishable from them 
the spirits of the de parted the first time i experienced this was on a bicycle 
trip through upper italy which i took with a friend in  on the way home we 
cycled from pavia to arona on the lower part of lake maggiore  and spent the 
night there we had intended to pedal on along the lake and then through the 
tessin as far as faido where we were going to take the train to zurich but in 
arona i had a dream which upset our plans  
in the dream i was in an assemblage of distinguished spirits of earlier centuries 
the feeling was similar to the one i had later toward the illustrious ancestors in 
the black rock temple of my  vision the conversatio n was conducted in 
the nautis project   latin a gentleman with a long curly wig addressed me and asked a difficult 
question the gist of which i could no longer recall after i woke up i understood 
him but did not have a sufficient com mand of the language to answer him in 
latin i felt so pro foundly humiliated by this that the emotion awakened me  
at the very moment of awakening i thought of the book i was then working on 
wandlungen und symbole der libido and had such intense inferiority feelings 
about the unanswered que stion that i immediately took the train home in order 
to get back to work it would have been impossible for me to continue the 
bicycle trip and lose another three days i had to work to find the answer  
not until years later did i understand the dream an d my reaction the bewigged 
gentleman was a kind of ancestral spirit or spirit of the dead who had 
addressed questions to me in vain it was still too soon i had not yet come so 
far but i had an obscure feeling that by working on my book i would be 
answering the question that had been asked it had been asked by as it were 
my spiritual forefathers in the hope and expectation that they would learn 
what they had not been able to find out during their time on earth since the 
answer had first to be cr eated in the centuries that followed if question and 
answer had already been in existence in eternity had al ways been there no 
effort on my part would have been neces sary and it could all have been 
discovered in any other century there does seem to be unlimited knowledge 
present in nature it is true but it can be comprehended by consciousness only 
when the time is ripe for it the process presumably is like what happens in 
the individual psyche a man may go about for many years with an inkling o f 
something but grasps it clearly only at a particular moment  
later when i wrote the septem sermones  ad mortuos once again it was the 
dead who addressed crucial questions to me they came so they said back 
from jerusalem where they found not what they sought this had surprised me 
greatly at the time for according to the traditional views the dead are the 
possessors of great knowledge people have the idea that the dead know far 
more than we for christian doctri ne teaches that in the hereafter we shall see 
face to face apparently however the souls of the dead know only what they 
knew at the moment of death and nothing beyond that hence their endeavor 
to penetrate into life in order to share in the knowl edge of men i frequently 
have a feeling that they are standing directly behind us waiting to hear what 
answer we will give to them and what answer to destiny it seems to me as if 
they were dependent on the living for receiving answers to their question s that 
is on those who have survived them and exist in a world of change  as if 
omniscience or as i might put it omniconsciousness  were not at their 
disposal but could flow only into the psyche of the living into a soul bound to a 
body the mind of  the living appears therefore to hold an advantage over that 
of the dead in at least one point in the capacity for attain ing clear and decisive 
cognitions as i see it the three dimensional world in time and space is like a 
system of co ordinates what is here separated into ordinates  and abscissae may 
the nautis project   appear there in spacetimelessness  as a primordial image with many aspects 
perhaps as a diffuse cloud of cognition surrounding an archetype yet a system 
of coordinates is necessary if any dis tinction of discrete contents is to be 
possible any such operation seems to us unthinkable in a state of diffuse 
omniscience or as the case may be of subjectless  consciousness with no 
spatiotemporal demarcations cognition like generation presupposes an 
opposition a here and there an above and below a before and after  
if there were to be a conscious existence after death it would so it seems to 
me have to continue on the level of consciousness attained by humanity which 
in any age has an upper though variable limit there are many human beings 
who throughout their lives and at the moment of death lag behind their own 
potentialities and even more important behind the knowl edge which has been 
brought to consciousness by o ther human beings during their own lifetimes 
hence their demand to attain in death that share of awareness which they failed 
to win in life  
i have come to this conclusion through observation of dreams about the dead i 
dreamed once that i was paying a vi sit to a friend who had died about two 
weeks before in life this friend had never espoused anything but a 
conventional view of the world and had remained stuck in this unreflecting 
attitude in the dream his home was on a hill similar to the tullinger hill near 
basel the walls of an old castle surrounded a square con sisting of a small 
church and a few smaller buildings it re minded me of the square in front of the 
castle of rapperswil it was autumn the leaves of the ancient trees had turned 
gold and the whole scene was transfigured by gentle sunlight my friend sat at a 
table with his daughter who had studied psy chology in zurich i knew that she 
was telling him about psy chology he was so fascinated by what she was saying 
that he greeted me onl y with a casual wave of the hand as though to intimate 
dont disturb me the greeting was at the same time a dismissal the dream 
told me that now in a manner which of course remains incomprehensible to me 
he was re quired to grasp the reality of his  psychic existence which he had never 
been capable of doing during his life  
i had another experience of the evolution of the soul after death when about a 
year after my wifes death i suddenly awoke one night and knew that i had 
been with her in the sout h of france in provence and had spent an entire day 
with her she was engaged on studies of the grail there that seemed significant 
to me for she had died before completing her work on this subject 
interpretation on the subjective level that my anima had not yet finished with 
the work she had to do  yielded nothing of interest i know quite well that i am 
not yet finished with that but the thought that my wife was continuing after 
death to work on her further spiritual development however that may be 
conceived struck me as meaningful and held a measure of reassurance for me  
ideas of this sort are of course inaccurate and give a wrong picture like a 
the nautis project   body projected on a plane or conversely like the construction of a four 
dimensional model ou t of a three dimensional body they use the terms of a 
threedimensional world in order to represent themselves to us mathematics 
goes to great pains to create expressions for relationships which pass empirical 
comprehension in much the same way it is a llimportant for a disciplined 
imagination to build up images of intangi bles by logical principles and on the 
basis of empirical data that is on the evidence of dreams the method 
employed is what i have called the method of the necessary statement it 
represents the principle of amplification in the interpretation of dreams but 
can most easily be demonstrated by the statements implicit in simple whole 
numbers  
one as the first numeral is unity but it is also the unity the one all 
oneness ind ividuality and non dualitynot a numeral but a philosophical 
concept an archetype and attribute of god the monad it is quite proper that 
the human intellect should make these statements but at the same time the 
intellect is determined and limited by i ts conception of oneness and its 
implications in other words these statements are not arbitrary they are 
governed by the nature of oneness and therefore are necessary statements 
theoretically the same logical operation could be performed for each of t he 
following conceptions of number but in practice the process soon comes to an 
end because of the rapid increase in complications which become too numerous 
to handle  
every further unit introduces new properties and new modi fications thus it is a 
property of the number four that equations of the fourth degree can be solved 
whereas equations of the fifth degree cannot the necessary statement of the 
number four therefore is that among other things it is an apex and 
simultaneously the end of a pre ceding ascent since with each additional unit 
one or more new mathematical properties ap pear the statements attain such a 
complexity that they can no longer be formulated  
the infinite series of natural numbers corresponds to the in finite number of 
individual creatures that series likewise con sists of individuals and the 
properties even of its first ten members represent if they represent anything at 
allan abstract cosmogony derived from the monad the properties of numbers 
are however simul taneously properties of matter for which reason certain 
equations can anticipate its behavior  
therefore i submit that other than mathematical statements ie statements 
implicit in nature are likewise capable of pointing to irrepresentable  realities 
beyond themselves such for example as those products of the imagination 
which enjoy universal acceptance or are distinguished by the frequency of their 
occurrence like the whole class of archetypal motifs just as in the case of 
some factors in mathemati cal equations we can not say to what physical realities 
they correspond so in the case of some mythological products we do not know 
the nautis project   at first to what psychic realities they refer equations governing the turbulence 
of heated gases existed long before the p roblems of such gases had been 
precisely investigated similarly we have long been in possession of 
mythologems  which express the dynamics of cer tain subliminal processes 
though these processes were only given names in very recent times  
the maximum awa reness which has been attained anywhere forms so it seems 
to me the upper limit of knowledge to which the dead can attain that is 
probably why earthly life is of such great significance and why it is that what a 
human being brings over at the time of  his death is so important only here in 
life on earth where the opposites  clash together can the general level of 
consciousness be raised that seems to be mans metaphysical task which he 
cannot accomplish without mythologizing  myth is the natural and 
indispensable inter mediate stage between unconscious and conscious cognition 
true the unconscious knows more than consciousness does but it is knowledge 
of a special sort knowledge in eternity usu ally without reference to the here 
and now not c ouched in lan guage of the intellect only when we let its 
statements amplify themselves as has been shown above by the example of nu 
merals does it come within the range of our understanding only then does a 
new aspect become perceptible to us this pr ocess is convincingly repeated in 
every successful dream analysis that is why it is so important not to have any 
preconceived doc trinaire opinions about the statements made by dreams as 
soon as a certain monotony of i nterpretation strikes us we know that our 
approach has become doctrinaire and hence sterile  
although there is no way to marshal valid proof of continu ance of the soul after 
death there are nevertheless experiences which make us thoughtful i take 
them as hints and do not presume to ascribe to them the significance of 
insights  
one night i lay awake thinking of the sudden death of a friend whose funeral 
had taken place the day before i was deeply concerned suddenly i felt that he 
was in the room it seemed to me that he stood at the foot of my bed and was 
asking me to go with him i did not have the feeling of an apparition rather it 
was an inner visual image of him which i explained to myself as a fantasy but 
in all honesty i had to ask myself  do i have any proof that this is a fantasy 
suppose it is not a fantasy suppose my friend is really here and i decided he 
was only a fantasy would that not be abominable of me yet i had equally 
little proof that he stood before me as an apparition then  i said to myself 
proof is neither here nor there instead of explaining him away as a fantasy i 
might just as well give him the benefit of the doubt and for experiments sake 
credit him with reality the moment i had that thought he went to the door 
and beckoned me to follow him so i was going to have to play along with him 
that was something i hadnt bargained for i had to repeat my argument to 
myself once more only then did i follow him in my imagination  
the nautis project   he led me out of the house into the gar den out to the road and finally to his 
house in reality it was several hundred yards away from mine i went in and 
he conducted me into his study he climbed on a stool and showed me the 
second of five books with red bindings which stood on the secon d shelf from the 
top then the vision broke off i was not acquainted with his library and did not 
know what books he owned certainly i could never have made out from below 
the titles of the books he had pointed out to me on the second shelf from the 
top  
this experience seemed to me so curious that next morning i went to his widow 
and asked whether i could look up some thing in my friends library sure enough 
there was a stool standing under the bookcase i had seen in my vision  and even 
before i came closer i could see the five books with red bind ings i stepped up 
on the stool so as to be able to read the titles they were translations of the 
novels of emile zola the title of the second volume read the legacy of the 
dead the contents seemed to me of no interest only the title was extremely 
significant in connection with this experience  
equally important to me were the dream experiences i had before my mothers 
death news of her death came to me while i was staying in t he tessin i was 
deeply shaken for it had come with unexpected suddenness the night before 
her death i had a frightening dream i was in a dense gloomy forest fan tastic 
gigantic boulders lay about among huge jungle like trees it was a heroic 
primeval landscape suddenly i heard a piercing whistle that seemed to resound 
through the whole universe my knees shook then there were crashings in the 
underbrush and a gigantic wolfhound  with a fearful gaping maw burst forth at 
the sight of it the blood  froze in my veins it tore past me and i suddenly 
knew the wild huntsman had commanded it to carry away a human soul i 
awoke in deadly terror and the next morning i received the news of my 
mothers passing  
seldom has a dream so shaken me for upon su perficial con sideration it seemed 
to say that the devil had fetched her but to be accurate the dream said that it 
was the wild huntsman the grnhult or wearer of the green hat who 
hunted with his wolves that night it was the season of fhn storms in january 
it was wotan the god of my alemannic  forefathers who had gathered my 
mother to her ancestors negatively to the wild horde but positively to the 
slig lt the blessed folk it was the christian missionaries who made wotan 
into a devil in h imself he is an important god a mercury or hermes as the ro 
mans correctly realized a nature spirit who returned to life again in the merlin 
of the grail legend and became as the spiritus mercurialis  the sought after 
arcanum of the alchemists thus th e dream says that the soul of my mother was 
taken into that greater territory of the self which lies beyond the segment of 
christian morality taken into that wholeness of nature and spirit in which 
conflicts and contradi ctions are resolved  
the nautis project   i went home immediately and while i rode in the night train i had a feeling of 
great grief but in my heart of hearts i could not be mournful and this for a 
strange reason during the entire journey i continually heard dance music 
laughter and jollity as though a wedding were being celebrated this 
contrasted vio lently with the devastating impression the dream had made on 
me here was gay dance music cheerful laughter and it was im possible to yield 
entirely to my sorrow again and again it was on the point of overwhelming me 
but the next moment i would find myself once more engulfed by the merry 
melodies one side of me had a feeling of warmth and joy and the other of 
terror and grief i was thrown back and forth between these  contrasting 
emotions  
this paradox can be explained if we suppose that at one mo ment death was 
being represented from the point of view of the ego and at the next from that 
of the psyche in the first case it appeared as a catastrophe that is how it s o 
often strikes us as if wicked and pitiless powers had put an end to a human life  
and so it is death is indeed a fearful piece of brutality there is no sense 
pretending otherwise it is brutal not only as a physical event but far more so 
psychically a human being is torn away from us and what remains is the icy 
stillness of death there no longer exists any hope of a relationship for all the 
bridges have been smashed at one blow those who deserve a long life are cut 
off in the prime of their years  and good fornothings live to a ripe old age this 
is a cruel reality which we have no right to sidestep the actual experience of 
the cruelty and wantonness  of death can so embitter us that we conclude there 
is no merciful god no justice and no kindnes s  
from another point of view however death appears as a joy ful event in the 
light of eternity it is a wedding a mysterium coniunctionis  the soul attains as 
it were its missing half it achieves wholeness on greek sarcophagi the joyous 
element wa s represented by dancing girls on etruscan tombs by banquets 
when the pious cabbalist rabbi simon ben jochai came to die his friends said 
that he was celebrating his wedding to this day it is the custom in many regions 
to hold a picnic on the graves on all souls day such customs express the feeling 
that death is really a festive occasion  
several months before my mothers death in september  i had a dream 
which presaged it it concerned my father and made a deep impr ession upon 
me i had not dreamed of my fa ther since his death in  now he once more 
appeared in a dream as if he had returned from a distant journey he looked 
rejuvenated and had shed his appearance of paternal authoritarianism  i went 
into my li brary with him and was greatly pleased at the prospect of finding out 
what he had been up to i was also looking forward with particular joy to 
introducing my wife and children to him to showing him my house and to tell 
ing him all that had happened to me and what i had become in the meanwhile i 
wanted also to tell him about my book on psychological types which had 
the nautis project   recently been published but i quickly saw that all this would be inopportune 
for my father looked preoccupied apparently he wanted somet hing from me i 
felt that plainly and so i refrained from talking about my own concerns  
he then said to me that since i was after all a psychologist he would like to 
consult me about marital psychology i made ready to give him a lengthy lecture 
on the complexities of mar riage but at this point i awoke i could not properly 
understand the dream for it never occurred to me that it might refer to my 
mothers death i realized that only when she died suddenly in january   
my parents marriage was not  a happy one but full of trials and dif ficulties and 
tests of patience both made the mistakes typical of many couples my dream 
was a forecast of my mothers death for here was my father who after an 
absence of twenty six years wished to ask a psychol ogist about the newest 
insights and information on marital problems since he would soon have to 
resume this relationship again evidently he had acquired no better 
understanding in his timeless state and therefore had to  appeal to someone 
among the living who en joying the benefits of changed times might have a 
fresh approach to the whole thing  
such was the dreams message undoubtedly i could have found out a good deal 
more by looking into its subjective mean ingbut why did i dream it just before 
the death of my mother which i did not foresee it plainly referred to my 
father with whom i felt a sympathy that deepened as i grew older  
since the unconscious as the result of its spatio temporal rela tivity possesse s 
better sources of information than the conscious mind which has only sense 
perceptions available to it we are dependent for our myth of life after death 
upon the meager hints of dreams and similar spontaneous revelations from the 
unconscious as i have a lready said we cannot attribute to these allusions the 
value of knowledge let alone proof they can how ever serve as suitable bases 
for mythic amplifications they give the probing intellect the raw material which 
is indispensable for its vitality cu t off the intermediary world of mythic 
imagination and the mind falls prey to doctrinaire rigidities on the other hand 
too much traffic with these germs of myth is dan gerous for weak and suggestible 
minds for they are led to mis take vague intimation s for substantial knowledge 
and to hypostatize  mere phantasms  
one widespread myth of the hereafter is formed by the ideas and images 
centering on reincarnation in one country whose intellectual culture is highly 
complex and much older than ours i am of course referring to india the idea 
of reincarnation is as much taken for granted as among us the idea that god 
created the world or that there is a spiritus rector cultivated hindus know 
that we do not share their ideas about this but that does not  trouble them in 
keeping with the spirit of the east the succession of birth and death is viewed 
as an endless continuity as an eternal wheel rolling on forever without a goal 
the nautis project   man lives and attains knowledge and dies and begins again from the beginning  
only with the buddha does the idea of a goal emerge namely the overcoming 
of earthly existence  
the mythic needs of the occidental call for an evolutionary cosmogony with a 
beginning and a goal the occidental rebels against a cosmogony with a 
beginning and mere end just as he cannot accept the idea of a static self 
contained eternal cycle of events the oriental on the other hand seems able 
to come to terms with this idea apparently there is no unanimous feeling about 
the nature of the world any more than there is general agreement among 
contemporary astronomers on this question to western man the 
meaninglessness  of a merely static universe is unbearable he must assume that 
it has meaning the oriental does not nee d to make this assumption rather he 
himself em bodies it whereas the occidental feels the need to complete the 
meaning of the world the oriental strives for the fulfillment of meaning in man 
stripping the world and existence from himself buddha  
i would say that both are right western man seems pre dominantly extraverted 
eastern man predominantly intro verted the former projects the meaning and 
considers that it exists in objects the latter feels the meaning in himself but 
the meaning is both wi thout and within  
the idea of rebirth is inseparable from that of karma the crucial question is 
whether a mans karma is personal or not if it is then the preordained destiny 
with which a man enters life represents an achievement of previous lives and a 
personal con tinuity therefore exists if however this is not so and an im 
personal karma is seized upon in the act of birth then that karma is incarnated 
again without there being any personal con tinuity  
buddha was twice asked by his disciples whe ther mans karma is personal or not 
each time he fended off the question and did not go into the matter to know 
this he said would not con tribute to liberating oneself from the illusion of 
existence buddha considered it far more useful for his disci ples to medi tate 
upon the nidana chain that is upon birth life old age and death and upon 
the cause and effect of suffering  
i know no answer to the question of whether the karma which i live is the 
outcome of my past lives or whether it is not rat her the achievement of my 
ancestors whose heritage comes to gether in me am i a combination of the 
lives of these ancestors and do i embody these lives again have i lived before in 
the past as a specific personality a nd did i progress so far in that life that i am 
now able to seek a solution i do not know buddha left the question open and i 
like to assume that he himself did not know with certainty  
i could well imagine that i might have lived in former cen turies and there 
encountered questions i was not yet able to answer that i had to be born again 
the nautis project   because i had not fulfilled the task that was given to me when i die my deeds 
will follow along with me that is how i imagine it i will brin g with me what i 
have done in the meantime it is important to insure that i do not stand at the 
end with empty hands buddha too seems to have had this thought when he 
tried to keep his di sciples from wasting time on useless speculation  
the meaning of my existence is that life has addressed a question to me or 
conversely i myself am a question which is addressed to the world and i must 
communicate my answer for otherwise i am dependen t upon the world s 
answer that is a suprapersonal  life task which i accomplish only by effort and 
with difficulty perhaps it is a question which preoccupied my ancestors and 
which they could not answer could that be why i am so impressed by the fact 
that the conclusion of faust contains no solution or by the problem on which 
nietzsche foun dered the dionysian  side of life to which the christian seems to 
have lost the way or is it the restless wotanhermes of my alemannic  and 
frankish ancestors who  poses challenging rid dles  
what i feel to be the resultant of my ancestors lives or a karma acquired in a 
previous personal life might perhaps equally well be an impersonal archetype 
which today presses hard on everyone and has taken a particular hold  upon me
an archetype such as for example the development over the cen turies of the 
divine triad and its confrontation with the femi nine principle or the still 
pending answer to the gnostic question as to the origin of evil or to put it 
another way  the incompleteness of the christian god image  
i also think of the possibility that through the achievement of an individual a 
question enters the world to which he must provide some kind of answer for 
example my way of posing the question as well as my answer may be 
unsatisfactory that being so someone who has my karma or i myself would 
have to be reborn in order to give a more complete answer it might happen 
that i would not be reborn again so long as the world needed no su ch answer 
and that i would be entitled to several hundred years of peace until someone 
was once more needed who took an interest in these matters and could 
profitably tackle the task anew i imagine that for a while a period of rest could 
ensue until the  stint i had done in my lifetime needed to be taken up again  
the question of karma is obscure to me as is also the problem of personal 
rebirth or of the transmigration of souls with a free and open mind i listen 
attentively to the indian doctrine of r ebirth and look around in the world of my 
own experience to see whether somewhere and somehow there is some 
authentic sign pointing toward reincarnation naturally i do not count the 
relatively numerous testimonies here in the west to the be lief in 
reincarnation a belief proves to me only the phenomenon of belief not the 
content of the belief this i must see revealed empirically in order to accept it 
until a few years ago i could not discover anything convincing in this respect 
although i kept a s harp lookout for any such signs recently however i 
the nautis project   observed in myself a series of dreams which would seem to describe the process 
of reincarnation in a deceased person of my acquaint ance but i have never 
come across any such dreams in other persons a nd therefore have no basis for 
comparison since this observation is subjective and unique i prefer only to 
mention its existence and not to go into it any further i must confess how ever 
that after this experience i view the problem of reincarna tion with somewhat 
different eyes though without being in a position to assert a definite opinion  
if we assume that life continues there we cannot conceive of any other form 
of existence except a psychic one for the life of the psyche requires no space 
and no time psychic existence and above all the inner images with which we 
are here con cerned supply the material for all mythic speculations about a life 
in the hereafter and i imagine that life as a continuance in the world of images 
thus the psyche might be that existence in which the hereafter or the land of 
the dead is located  
from the psychological point of view life in the hereafter would seem to be a 
logical continuation of the psychic life of old age with increasing age 
contemplation and reflection the inner images naturally play an ever greater 
part in mans life yo ur old men shall dream dreams that to be sure presup 
poses that the psyches of the old men have not become wooden or entirely 
petrifiedsero medicina paratur cum mala per longas convaluere  moms in old 
age one begins to let memories unroll before the mind s eye and musing to 
recognize oneself in the inner and outer images of the past this is like a 
preparation for an existence in the hereafter just as in platos view philosophy 
is a preparation for death  
the inner images keep me from getting lost in personal retro spection many old 
people become too involved in their reconstruction of past events they remain 
imprisoned in the se memories but if it is reflective and is translated into 
images retrospection can be a reculer pour mieux sauter i try to see the line 
which leads through my life into the world and out of the world again  
in general the conception people form of th e hereafter is largely made up of 
wishful thinking and prejudices thus in most conceptions the hereafter is 
pictured as a pleasant place that does not seem so obvious to me i hardly 
think that after death we shall be spirited to some lovely flowering me adow if 
everything were pleasant and good in the hereafter surely there would be some 
friendly communication between us and the blessed spirits and an outpouring 
upon us of goodness and beauty from the prenatal state but there is nothing of 
the sort w hy is there this insurmountable barrier between the departed and the 
living at least half the reports of encounters with the dead tell of terrifying 
experiences with dark spirits and it is the rule that the land of the dead 
                                                           
 acts  joel  
 the medicine is prepared too late when the illness has grown strong by long delay 
the nautis project   observes icy silence unperturbed by the grief of the bereaved  
to follow out the thought that involuntarily comes to me the world i feel is 
far too unitary for there to be a hereafter in which the rule of opposites  is 
completely absent there too is nature which after its fashion is also gods 
the world into which we enter after death will be grand and terrible like god 
and like all of nature  that we know nor can i conceive that suffering should 
entirely cease granted that what i experi enced in my  visions liberation 
from the burden of the body and perception of meaning gave me the deepest 
bliss nevertheless there was darkness too a nd a strange cessation of human 
warmth remember the black rock to which i came it was dark and of the 
hardest granite what does that mean if there were no imperfections no 
primordial defect in the ground of creation why should there be any urge to 
create any longing for what must yet be fulfilled why should the gods be the 
least bit concerned about man and creation about the continu ation of the 
nidana chain to infinity after all the buddha op poses to the painful illusion of 
existence his quod non and the christian hopes for the swift coming of this 
worlds end  
it seems probable to me that in the hereafter too there exist certain 
limitations but that the souls of the dead only gradually find out where the 
limits of the liberated state lie s omewhere out there there must be a 
determinant a necessity condition ing the world which seeks to put an end to 
the afterdeath state this creative determinant so i imagine it must decide 
what souls will plunge again into birth certain souls i imagi ne feel the state of 
threedimensional existence to be more blissful than that of eternity but 
perhaps that depends upon how much of completeness or incompleteness they 
have taken across with them from their human existence  
it is possible that any furth er spell of three dimensional life would have no more 
meaning once the soul had reached a cer tain stage of understanding it would 
then no longer have to re turn fuller understanding having put to rout the desire 
for reembodiment then the soul would va nish from the threedimensional 
world and attain what the buddhists call nirvana but if a karma still remains to 
be disposed of then the soul re lapses again into desires and returns to life once 
more perhaps even doi ng so out of the realization that something remains to be 
completed  
in my case it must have been primarily a passionate urge to ward understanding 
which brought about my birth for that is the strongest element in my nature 
this insatiable drive toward u nderstanding has as it were created a 
consciousness in order to know what is and what happens and in order to piece 
together mythic conceptions from the slender hints of the un knowable  
we lack concrete proof that anything of us is preserved for etern ity at most we 
can say that there is some probability that something of our psyche continues 
the nautis project   beyond physical death whether what continues to exist is conscious of itself 
we do not know either if we feel the need to form some opinion on this 
question w e might possibly consider what has been learned from the 
phenomena of psychic dissociation in most cases where a split off complex 
manifests itself it does so in the form of a personality as if the complex had a 
consciousness of itself thus the voices h eard by the insane are personified i 
dealt long ago with this phenomenon of personified complexes in my doc toral 
dissertation we might if we wish adduce these complexes as evidence for  a 
continuity of consciousness likewise in favor of such an assump tion are certain 
astonishing observations in cases of profound syncope after acute injuries to the 
brain and in severe states of collapse in both situations total loss of con 
sciousness can be accompanied by perceptions of the outside world and vivid 
dream experiences since the cerebral cortex the seat of consciousness is not 
functioning at these times there is as yet no explanation for such phenomena 
they may be evi dence for at least a subjective persistence of the capacity for 
consciousness even in a state of apparent unconsciousness   
the thorny problem of t he relationship between eternal man the self a nd 
earthly man in time and space was illuminated by two dreams of mine  
in one dream which i had in october  i caught sight from my house of two 
lensshaped metallically gleaming disks which hurtled in a narrow arc over the 
house and down to the lak e they were two ufos unidentified flying objects 
then another body came flying directly toward me it was a per fectly circular 
lens like the objective of a telescope at a distance of four or five hundred 
yards it stood still for a moment and then f lew off immediately afterward 
another came speeding through the air a lens with a metallic extension which 
led to a box a magic lantern at a distance of sixty or seventy yards it stood 
still in the air pointing straight at me i awoke with a feeling o f astonishment 
still half in the dream the thought passed through my head we always think 
that the ufos are projections of ours now it turns out that we are their 
projections i am pro jected by the magic lantern as c g jung but who 
manipulates the  apparatus  
i had dreamed once before of the problem of the self and the ego in that 
earlier dream i was on a hiking trip i was walking along a little road through a 
hilly landscape the sun was shining and i had a wide view in all directions then 
i came to a small wayside chapel the door was ajar and i went in to my sur 
prise there was no image of the virgin on the altar and no cruci fix either but 
only a wonderful flower arrangement but then i saw that on the floor in front 
of the altar facing me sat a yogi  in lotus posture in deep meditation when i 
looked at him more closely i realized that he had my face i started in profound 
fright and awoke with the thought aha so he is the one who is meditating

the nautis project   me he has a dream and i am it i knew that when he awakened i would no 
longer be  
i had this dream after my illness in  it is a parable my self retires into 
meditation and meditates my earthly form to put it another way it assumes 
human shape in order to enter three dimensional e xistence as if someone were 
putting on a divers suit in order to dive into the sea when it renounces 
existence in the hereafter the self assumes a religious posture as the chapel in 
the dream shows in earthly form i t can pass through the experiences of the 
threedimensional world and by greater awareness take a further step toward 
realization  
the figure of the yogi then would more or less represent my unconscious 
prenatal wholeness and the far east as is often the case in dreams a psychic 
state alien and opposed to our own like the magic lantern the yogis 
meditation projects my em pirical reality as a rule we see this causal 
relationship in re verse in the products of the unconscious we discover mandala 
symbols that is circular and quaternary figures which express wholeness and 
whenever we wish to express wholeness we em ploy just such figures our basis 
is egoconsciousness our world the field of light centered upon the focal point 
of the ego from  that point we look out upon an enigmatic world of obscurity 
never knowing to what extent the shadowy forms we see are caused by our 
consciousness or possess a reality of their own the superficial observer is 
content with the first assumption but close r study shows that as a rule the 
images of the unconscious are not produced by consciousness but have a reality 
and spontaneity of their own nevertheless we regard them as mere marginal 
phenomena  
the aim of both these dreams is to effect a reversal of the relationship between 
egoconsciousness and the unconscious and to represent the unconscious as the 
generator of the empirical personality this reversal suggests that in the opinion 
of the other side our unconscious existence is the real one and o ur conscious 
world a kind of illusion an apparent reality con structed for a specific purpose 
like a dream which seems a re ality as long as we are in it it is clear that this 
state of affairs resembles very closely the oriental conception of maya  
unconscious wholeness therefore seems to me the true spiritus rector of all 
biological and psychic events here is a principle which strives for total 
realization which in mans case signifies the attainment of total consciousness 
attainment of conscious ness is culture in the broadest sense and self 
knowledge is there fore the heart and essence of this process the oriental 
attributes unquestionably divine significance to the self and according to the 
                                                           
 a tendency to question the locus of reality manifested itself early in jungs life when as a child he sat upon the 
stone and toyed with the idea that the stone was saying or was i cf the wellknown butterfly dream in chuangtzu 
aj 
the nautis project   ancient christian view self knowledge is the road to knowledge of god  
the decisive question for man is is he related to something infinite or not that 
is the telling question of his life only if we know that the thing which truly 
matters is the infinite can we avoid fixing our interest upon f utilities and upon 
all kinds of goals which are not of real importance thus we demand that the 
world grant us recognition for qualities which we regard as personal possessions 
our talent or our beauty the more a man lays stress on false possessions an d 
the less sensitivity he has for what is essential the less satisfying is his life he 
feels limited because he has limited aims and the result is envy and jealousy if 
we understand and feel that here in this life we already have a link with the 
infinite desires and attitudes change in the final analysis we count for 
something only because of the essential we embody and if we do not embody 
that life is wasted in our relationships to other men too the crucial question 
is whether an element of bou ndlessness is expressed in the relationship  
the feeling for the infinite however can be attained only if we are bounded to 
the utmost the greatest limitation for man is the self it is manifested in the 
experience i am only that only consciousness  of our narrow confinement in 
the self forms the link to the limitlessness  of the unconscious in such aware ness 
we experience ourselves concurrently as limited and eter nal as both the one 
and the other in knowing ourselves to be unique in our personal  combination 
that is ultimately limited we possess also the capacity for becoming conscious 
of the infinite but only then  
in an era which has concentrated exclusively upon extension of living space and 
increase of rational knowledge at all costs it is  a supreme challenge to ask man 
to become conscious of his uniqueness and his limitation uniqueness and 
limitation are synonymous without them no perception of the unlimited is 
possibleand consequently no coming to consciousness either merely a 
delusory identity with it which takes the form of intoxication with large numbers 
and an avidity for political power  
our age has shifted all emphasis to the here and now and thus brought about a 
daemonization  of man and his world the phenomenon of dictators and all the 
misery they have wrought springs from the fact that man has been robbed of 
transcend ence by the shortsightedness of the super intellectuals like them he 
has fallen a victim to unconsciousness but man s task is the exact opposite to 
become conscious of the contents that press upward from the unconscious 
neither should he persist in his unconsciousness nor remain identical with the 
unconscious elements of his being thus evading his destiny which is to c reate 
more and more consciousness as far as we can discern the sole purpose of 
human existence is to kindle a light in the darkness of mere being it may even 
be assumed that just as the unconscious affects us so the increase in our 
consciousness affect s the unconscious
