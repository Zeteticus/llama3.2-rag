a critical survey of the theore tical views on the psychology of deme ntia praecox incl udes discussions 
and comparisons of the works of freud gross jiling and a number of others an overview of the 
literature on the subject shows th at the research although fragment ary and apparently uncoordinated 
agrees that the symptoms commonly include a cent ral disturbance  a lo wering of attention or 
apperceptive deterioration this is typically manifest in superf iciality of associations symbolism 
stereotypies perseverations command automatism s apathy aboulia disturbance of reproduction and 
negativism rene masselons exhaustive study on catatonic psychology emphasizes the characteristic 
reduction of attention he feels the patient suffers a pe rpetual distraction in which perception of external 
objects awareness of his own personality judgment the feeling of rapport belief  and certainty all fade 
or disappear when power of attent ion disappears freud was the first to demonstrate the principle of 
conversion in a case of paranoid dementia pr aecox in explaining the em otional impoverishment 
characteristic of dementia praecox neisser observed that the mobility of symptoms in hysteria is due to 
the mobility of affects while para noia is characterized by a fixation of affects it is hypothesized that in 
dementia praecox there is a specific  concomitant of the affect that causes the final fixation of the 
precipitating complex impeding the fu rther development of the personalit y the possibility that in some 
cases the primary factor may be a change in the me tabolism is postulated such ideas and their detailed 
psychological processes are outlined for a large se lection of the leading au thors on dementia praecox 
near the turn of the century  references  
 the psychology of dementia praecox  the fe elingtoned complex and its general effects 
on the psyche  in jung c collected works of c g j ung vol  princeton university press  
 p p   
observations based on experimental work are made  on the feeling toned complex and its acute and 
chronic effects on the psyche the feeling toned co mplex is defined as the whole fabric of ideas 
surrounding the feeling tone an affect ive state accompanied by somatic effects the attempt is made to 
define the essential basis of personality which is held to be affectivity virtually every individual 
association is deemed to relate to some complex as  well as to the ego complex the whole mass of ideas 
pertaining to the ego  in a normal person the strongest complex egocentric ideas are commonly 
interrupted by affects leading to new complexes that  inhibit other ideas the acute effects and the 
chronic effects of the complex are defined and compar ed disturbances caused by complexes have been 
demonstrated in association expe riments by prolonged reaction times abnormal reactions and forgetting 
critical or postcritical reactions the effect of a strong complex on a normal psyche is illustrated in the 
classical state of being in love other forms of the sexual complex and other complexes are sometimes 
influenced by various types of displacement in cluding disguising the complex by superimposing a 
contrasting mood  references  
 the psychology of dementia praecox  the in fluence of the feelingtoned complex on the 
valency of associations  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  princeton university 
press   p p   
the diminution of the valency of associations caused by the feeling toned complex is discussed and 
general remarks on the complexes are made based on word association tests and illustrated with 
exam ples from cases it was shown that a sudden strikin g increase in su perficial associations durin g the 
association experiment wit hout any artificial distraction indicate s a reduction in atte ntion caused by a 
feeling toned complex if the comp lex is repressed the subject may not be conscious of it other 
examples of disturbances of attention are found in  slips of the tongue slip s of the pen misreading 
melodic automatisms in which whistling or humming contain the complex in metaphorical form and 
puns dreams symbolic expressions of the represse d complex are excellent ex amples of expression by 
similarity of imagery a detailed analysis of a dream emphasi zes the ambiguity of dream images 
comparable to the superficial associations seen in a state of reduced attention in distraction experiments 
the complexes have a tendency to cause contrasting a ssociations seen as emotional and verbal contrasts 
in hysteria and as verbal contrasts in dementia praecox it is concluded that every affective event 
becomes a complex most complexes are held to be  sexual as are most dreams and most of the 
hysterias especially in women time usually frees the normal individual from obsessive complexes but 
sometimes he needs artifici al aid and it has been found that disp lacement can help if the complex is 
successfully repressed the s will be complex sensitiv e for a long time if the complex remains entirely 
unchanged which happens only after severe damage to the ego complex dementia praecox can develop 
it is conjectured that toxic effects may be involved in this degene ration  references

collected works of c g jung vol  prince ton university press    p p   
a review of the psychologi cal similarities of dementia prae cox and hysteria compares emotional 
disturbances character abnormalities  intellectual disturbances and stereotypy in the two diseases the 
emotional indifference in cases of acute dementia prae cox is similar to the inadequate responses of the 
hysteric whose complex is under special inhibition explosive excitements may be brought about in 
dementia praecox in the same way as the explosive af fects in hysteria typica l symptoms of dementia 
praecox include lack of selfcontro l and lack of emotional rapport bot h of which are sometimes found in 
hysteria as well character disturbances common to  the two illnesses include affectation especially 
when patients are out of their social element lack  of consideration narrowm indedness inaccessibility 
to persuasion and stupid behavior although in deme ntia praecox the mechanisms go much deeper 
intellectual impairments found in both dementia praecox and hysteria include shades of clouding of 
lucidity of consciousness ranging from perfect clarity to deepes t confusion disturbance of attention 
disorientation delusions hallucinations compulsive  thinking negativism and sleep disturbances 
stereotypy a characteristic symptom of  dementia praecox is also seen in hysteria and in the form of 
automatization is a common phenomenon in normal devel opment it is concluded that in hysteria the 
psyche is disabled because it cannot rid itself of  a complex but many hysterics can regain their 
equilibrium by partially overcoming the complex and avoiding new trau mas in dementia praecox one 
or more complexes have become permanently fixed a nd cannot be overcome but it is not clear whether 
the complex caused or precipitated th e illness or whether at the onset of the illness a definite complex 
was present which then determined  the symptoms  references  
 the psychology of dementia pr aecox  analysis of a case of paranoid dementia as a 
paradigm  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  princeton university press   p 
p   
the analysis of a case of paranoid dementia in a middleaged unmarried dressmaker suffering from 
delusions and auditory hallucinations  is discussed as a typical paradigm  of psychoanalysis it is shown 
how the patient in her psychosis creates a compli cated and utterly confused and senseless fantasy 
structure she describes the hopes and disappointments of her life in her symptoms the nearest analogy 
to her thinking is the normal dream which employs  the same or similar psychological mechanisms 
word associations revealed a series of comple x constellations including the complex of personal 
grandeur exaggerated according to the patients mo rbidly intensified selfesteem the complex of 
injury and an erotic com plex the first part of the anal ysis conducted in the manner of dream anal ysis 
describes her sufferings and their symbols the second her wishes and their fulfillment in symbolic 
images and episodes and the third deals with her inti mate erotic wishes and the solution of the problem 
through the transfer of her power and suffer ings to her children  references  
 the content of the psychoses  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  princeton 
university press   p p   
case studies are presented in which an argument is  presented for the present position regarding the 
content of the psychoses it is contended that the difference between his theory and e bleulers is 
whether psychological dist urbance should be regarded as primary or secondary in relation to the 
physiological basis and that resolution depends on wh ether the prevailing dogma   that mental diseases 
are diseases of the brain  repres ents a final truth or not it is poi nted out that  of the patients 
admitted to burgholzli mental hospit al over a period of  years suffered  from dementia praecox usually 
with some disturbance of feeling an d often with delusions and hallucinat ions however even in the most 
severe cases lasting for a period of years an inta ct brain was frequently found postmortem which is 
proof that the purely anatomical approach leads only indirectly to an understanding of psychic 
disturbance following the lead of older clinicians it was found that me ntal illness often occurred at a 
moment of some great emotional episode that had aris en in a more or less normal manner and that there 
were a number of symptoms in th e ensuing disturbances that could not be understood from a purely 
anatomical standpoint but became comprehensible when considered from the standpoint of the 
individuals previous history fr euds study of the psychology of hyste ria and dreams is cited as the 
greatest stimulus and aid in this work these in sights may have general or limited validity but 
nonetheless there is no symptom in dementia pra ecox that can be described as psychologically 
meaningless  references  
 on psychological understanding  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  
princeton university press   p p   
a constructive method of approaching the workings of the mind in  the diagnosis of dementia praecox 
based on prospective understanding is advanced in pr eference to freuds anal ytical reductive method 
based on a causality or retrospective understanding wh ich seems better suited to understanding hysteria 
pnncipal criticism of the analytic method is that it does not engage the wealth and variety of symbolism 
of the psychotic the futili ty of understanding symbolism by the cau sative analytic methods applied in 
science is illustrated in attempts to understand th e symbolism in faust ii which requires the subjective 
conditioning of knowledge to be fully appreciated similarly any understanding of the human psyche o f 
mans dreams or of anything psychological must be  tempered by the evaluators subjective attitude 
toward it mental development re sults from active speculation based on experience not from experience 
alone the psyche therefore creates it own future as it lives therefore any causative evaluation of it in 
retrospect can be only partially true its dynamic quality as a creative entity eludes us a patient 
therefore should be asked what his goals are not  only what he has felt and thought extraversion and 
introversion are explained in detail and to simplify  pathological typing the hysterics are assigned to the 
former and the psychasthenics and schiz ophrenics to the latter  references  
 a criticism of bleulers theo ry of schizophrenic negativism  in jung c collected works of 
c g jung vol  princeton univer sity press   p p   
e bleulers theory of schizophrenic negativism examined in the light of the complex theory is criticized 
because it gives the impression that the ideas or te ndencies of the schizophrenic are always accompanied 
by their opposites bleuler presents the new and inte resting concept of ambiva lence which hypothesizes 
that every tendency is balanced by a contrary one it is noted that all feeling tones are balanced by their 
opposites giving the feelin g tone an ambivalent character but a strict se quence of psycholo gical causes 
conditions the negative reaction the characteristic  of the diseased mind is not the ambitendency 
ambivalence or schizophrenic splitt ing of the psyche cited by bleuler but resistance which is set up by 
the pathological thought complex the splitting of the psyche is not a predisposing cause but a 
manifestation of inner conf lict bleulers list of cau ses of negativism autistic withdrawal a life wound 
hostile relationship with the environm ent sexuality etcis examined a nd each is found to be directly 
related to the complex bleuler does not put much em phasis on the role of sexuality which is surprising 
since psychoanalysis has shown that th e source of negativism is resistan ce which in schizophrenia as in 
the neuroses arises from the sexual complex  references  
 on the importance of the unconscious in psychopathology  in jung c collected works of 
c g jung vol  princeton univer sity press   p p   
the function of the unconscious in mental disturbances as a compensation of the conscious psychic 
content is discussed the unconscious is defined as the sum of all those psychic events that are not 
intense enough to enter into consciousness in norma l people the unconscious ef fects a compensation of 
all conscious tendencies through a count er impulse and produces a balance this agency expresses itself 
in unconscious apparently inconsistent and uncharact eristic activities which freud calls symptomatic 
actions dreams are examples of the compensating functions of the unconscious in psychopathology the 
working of the unconscious seen most clearly in su ch disturbances as hysteri a and obsessiona l neurosis 
is also seen clearly in the delusions and hallucinati ons of the psychoses but is not so easily recognized 
the mentally unbalanced person su ffering from a real imbalance between the conscious and the 
unconscious struggles against his own unconscious as  in the case of the eccentric inventor the 
alcoholic or the fanatical religi ous convert because of  the characteristic one sidedness of conscious 
striving in such cases the normal functioning of the unconscious breaks  through in an abnormal form 
which upsets the mental balance and disturbs the pers ons adaptation to his environment  reference  
 on the problem of psycho genesis in mental disease  in jung c collected works of c g 
jung vol  princeton university  press   p p   
psychogenesis in mental diseases is discussed wi th arguments presented for their physiological and 
psychological origins the materialistic dogma in psychiat ry is attributed to the fact that medicine is a 
natural science and the psychiatri st as a physician is a natural scientist the psychological and 
emotional experiences however have been proved to play  a decisive role in the courses of neuroses and 
in mental diseases although there are some cases of dementia praecox in which there is change in the 
brain cells these changes are not usually present and there are stri king differences between the usual 
symptoms of dementia praecox and those occurring in organic brain di sease cases of dementia praecox 
frequently improve or deteriorate in response to psychological or environmental conditions 
demonstrating that this disease should not be consid ered only organic several cases are described in 
which the onset of the disease or a new outbreak of it took place under spec ial emotional conditions 
one comparatively simple case of a sudden outbreak of dementia praecox in a young girl stresses the 
importance of examining the psychol ogical factors in the etiology and course of psychoses psychosis 
considered from the psychological viewpoint is pr imarily a mental condition in which unconscious 
elements replace reality in the mind of the patient th erefore this area is r ecommended to psychiatrists 
as a wide unexplored field for psychological research  
 mental disease and the psyche  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  princeton 
university press   p p   
the question of psychogenesis in mental diseases other than the neuroses which are now generally 
considered psychic in origin is discussed and the ps ychic etiology of schizophren ia is affirmed mental 
processes are products of the psyche and that same psyche produces delusions and hallucinations when 
it is out of balance in turn schizophrenia is c onsidered as having a psychology of its own but whereas 
the healthy persons ego is the subject of his experi ences the schizophrenics ego is only one of the 
subjects in schizophrenia the norma l subject has split into a plural ity of autonomous complexes at 
odds with one another and with reality bringing a bout a disintegration of the personality the simplest 
form of schizophrenia is paranoia a simple doubling of the personality the idea of being a persecuted 
victim gains the upper hand becomes autonomous and forms a second subject that  at times replaces the 
healthy ego the healthy ego unable to counter the affectivity of the second subject becomes paralyzed 
this is the beginning of schizophrenic apathy an example shows how the individual perhaps 
predisposed toward schizophrenia becomes ill becau se of an emotional shock and is overwhelmed by 
the pathological idea of persecution at a given psyc hological moment a study of the psychogenesis of 
schizophrenia explains why some milder cases can  be cured by psychotherapy such cures are rare 
however as the nature of the disease involving th e destruction of the pers onality rules against the 
possibility of psychic influence the microscopic le sions of the brain often found in schizophrenia are 
regarded as secondary symptoms of degeneration  
 on the psychogenesi s of schizophrenia  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  
princeton university press   p p   
in a discussion on the psychogenesis of schizophrenia an attempt is made to gain insight into the nature 
of its origin  whether psychic or  organic  by comparing certain of its primary symptoms with those of 
hysteria and other neuroses tracing the developmen t of expert opinion on the etiology of mental 
disorders a swing from a belief in organic to psychi c primary causes is evident in the neuroses as in 
schizophrenias the normal associations are dist urbed by the spontaneous intervention of complex 
contents typical of an abaissement a decline in conscious mental stre ngth its effect on the 
personality and a variety of conditions  that may produce it are outlined in  detail most are evident in the 
neuroses and the psychoses in the neuroses howev er the unity of the personality is potentially 
preserved whereas in the schizophrenias it is almo st always irreparably da maged the dissociation of 
thought present in both types of diseases is more pe rmanent and more severe in the schizophrenias in 
its extreme form an abaissement reduces the mental level to a point where the ego lacks the power to 
overcome the more powerful unconscious whether this be  in the form of dreams or hallucinations no 
reliable evidence is reported for organic causes of schizophrenia on the other hand the psychogenic 
conditions are at best indicators of symptoms that fa vor the disease and not proved causes of its origin 
a thorough understanding of psychology and aberra nt mentality by clin icians who practice 
psychotherapy is advocated  
 recent thoughts on schizophrenia  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  
princeton university press   p p   
the need for extensive research  in psychology and psychopathology particularly in the area of 
schizophrenia is emphasized in a paper prepared for a symposium on the fr ontiers of knowledge and 
humanitys hopes for the future in december  a thorough description of th e schizophrenic mental 
process dominates the paper in which its complexity  is highlighted by comparisons with the neuroses 
the hypothesis is advanced that certa in systemic toxins may be the cau se of psychotic dissociation in 
schizophrenia the profound understanding of psyc hology and the human mind including the mystic 
mythological and cultural ramifications is deemed necessary since the psychot ic dreams are generally 
numinous and highly impressive and their imagery ofte n contains motifs analogous or identical to those 
of religion or mythology the principal ailment is cons idered mental or psychic in which the normal 
thought processes are weakened abaissement concen tration and attention are relaxed and the value of 
associations decreases and become s relaxed as a result thoughts and fractions or flashes of ideas 
become manifest in the conscious weakened mind  interrupting thematic continuity and producing 
illogical ima ges this process and the source of its ima ges requires thorou gh stud y and understandin g

comments on  years experience in observing schi zophrenia contain impre ssions from experimental 
investigations of the distintegrati on of ideas prevalent in the diseas e similarity to dreams and dream 
content is observed in that ideas and images a ppear in random abrupt absurd grotesque and 
fragmentary confusion latent and pot ential psychoses among neurotics ar e estimated to run as high as 
 obsessional impulses typical of neuroses are converted to audito ry and visual hallucinations 
common to psychoses in such cases the psychosis still has not undermined the compensating activity o f 
consciousness therapeutic interven tion aims at restoring conscious awareness by changes in methods 
by inducing concentration on reality an d by engaging the patient in activ ities that lure him away from 
the unconscious this may be accomplished by having him draw or paint his visions a process by which 
the terrifying images become commonpl ace to him and the applied colors draw his feelings into the 
picture causing the chaotic situation to be visualized and objectified and thus depriving it of its power to 
terrify rather than applying numer ous therapeutic methods the therapists personal devotion to the 
patient and his problems are more  effective however excessi ve personal involvement unless 
adequately controlled may produce an induced psychosis in the ther apist in a summary statement 
outlining the nature and ment al mechanics of schizophrenia it is ad mitted that no true etiology for the 
disease has so far been discovered a shift of an older opinion now holds that  an entire psychogenic 
complex dominates schizophrenia and that the weaken ing of the ego personality formerly thought to be 
causal and primary is but a secondary manifestati on of the feeling toned complex furthermore a 
psychogenic causation is considered more probable than toxic causes previously hypothesized as

in a letter to the chairman of the symposium on chemical concepts of psychosis held at the second 
international congress for psychiat ry in zurich september  th e etiology of schizophrenia is 
considered to be both chemical and psychological it is hypothesized that the emotions that are the initial 
cause of metabolic changes are accompanied by chem ical processes that cause temporary or chronic 
mental disturbances
