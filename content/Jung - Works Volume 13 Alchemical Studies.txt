the text of the secret of  the golden flower a taoist text and an alchemi cal treatise is cited as the 
major source of the discovery of the connecting link between gnosis and th e collective unconscious a 
link that had been impossible to establish due to the absence of a history of ps ychic experience certain 
misunderstandings concerning the use of this text are corrected it is ne ither a recipe for happiness nor is 
the commentary on it a description of jungian psychot herapeutic method instead it  is stressed that the 
idea of the collective unconscious is  an empirical concept to be put  alongside the concept of libido

eastern and western approaches to the understandi ng of life are compared and contrasted without 
disparaging the western reliance on science a nd its necessary dependence on intellect it is 
acknowledged that eastern knowledge has been grounded in the awareness of psychic processes and the 
experiences of life for thousands of years in order for the west to advanc e to a higher state of life it is 
necessary to balance intellect and psychic knowledge hence the turning to ward the east in search of a 
way in which to achieve this balance western man is cautioned not to mistake imitation for true 
understanding and growth it will be only in combining the insights gained from the east with the highly 
developed intellectual function of the western psyc he that the full understanding of the human psyche 
will be achieved

clinical observations of patients opened a new appro ach to the concepts of chinese philosophy which is 
explained in terms of the theory of the collect ive unconscious a common substratum in the human 
psyche transcending all differences in culture an d consciousness the contents of the collective 
unconscious are expressed in archetype s that come into the consciousne ss in the form of symbols the 
dependence of conscious ideation and action on thes e common instincts is expl ored and attention is 
given to the neuroses that appear whenever the uncons cious has been repressed to the point where it is 
completely out of touch with the primordial images the unconscious appears to be in full revolt against 
the consciousness and the unity of the personality seems to  have disappeared it is at this point that one 
is encouraged to turn to the chinese philosophy fo r a way to resolve the conflict certain insights 
concerning this conflict gained from clinical obser vation are discussed and three observations are made 
 that patients do not solve the problem but outgrow it iearrive at  a new level of consciousness  
that a new potential was discovered stemming either from an outer happening or inner experience  
that this new potential was uncovered only by letting things happen ieahowing the fantansy function 
free reign so that the conscious mind can develop a new attitude towards the activity of the unconscious 
western man is again cautioned to avoid denying his ow n heritage in favor of the eastern solution or 
turning back to the medievalism of the christian chur ch the search is directed  to discovering oribs 
inner integrity

the circular movement and the center in jun g c collected works of c g jun g vol  
princeton university press   p p   
the psychological meanings of th e concept of tao and the mandala symbols are discussed tao is 
explained as a conscious way of uniting opposites a reunion of life and consci ousness that can only be 
accomplished by realizati on of the unconscious law of being this  union of opposites is neither rational 
nor relational but a process of psychic developm ent mandala symbols pr oduced by fantasies are 
examined and the frequent recurrence of the symbol  of the circle is documented by reference to 
medieval christian buddhist americ an indian and eastern mandalas such as the cross flower and 
wheel the golden flower the taoist mandala that e xpresses the secret of the tao is analyzed as a 
symbol of the beginning of life where everything is as one in studying the mandala as it appears in the 
drawings of patients it is  noted that the very expr ession of the symbol also produces a unifying effect 
bringing the patient back to the inner unconsciousne ss that is the source and goal of the psyche the 
circular characteristic of the mandala is examined and the texts from the writings of chivard maitland 
and hildegard of bingen are cited as  examples illustrating this charact eristic it is concluded that 
symbols are the key to the unconscious and hence th at the individuation process can never be obtained 
without the symbol   references

disintegration of consciousness  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  princeton 
university press   p p   
the dangers inherent in th e meeting between the cons cious and the collective unconscious are due to the 
autonomous psychic contents of th e latter it was the recognition of this danger that produced the 
symbolic figure of the protecting circle at the outset  these fragmentary systems are seen as affects as 
they grow more complicated they assume the characte r of personalities and are encountered as such in 
cases of psychologic splitting of the personalit y in mediumistic phenomena and in the phenomenology 
of religion thus it can be said th at the activated unconscious psychic c ontents first appear as projections 
but are gradually assimilated into  consciousness reshaped into conscious ideas the denial of the 
existence of the unconscious is seen as particularly dangerous not only to this individual in whom this 
denial leads to neurosis but also to nations where the collective delusions take  the form of destructive 
mass psychoses insanity is defined as possession by an unconscious content th at cannot be assimilated 
into consciousness since the very existence of th e former is denied western man is counseled to 
acknowledge the existence of these dissociative tendenc ies and to consciously detach himself from their 
power in order to free himself from subservience to them  reference

p p   
the figures of animus and anima as they appear in the secret of the golden flower are analyzed and 
compared to the present concepts of these terms animus hun is the masculine principle yang a 
higher breath soul that rises after death to the position of spirit or god shen arrima po is a feminine 
principle yin that descends to the earth afte r death and becomes a demon kuei the chinese 
philosphy recognized these two princi ples as distinguishable psychic factors united in the one human 
nature the psychologist recognizes the anima as an autonomous unconscious principle identifiable with 
the affective side of the masculine psyche and the archetype of all the experiences of man with woman 
the term logos is preferred to that of animus in defining the clarity of cons ciousness and rationality of 
the masculine psyche since these characteristics are uni versal not personal and are in sharp contrast to 
the personal anima in discussing the psychology of wome n the term animus is retained to indicate the 
quasiintellectual factor in the femi nine psyche consisting of inferior judgments or opinions animus is 
seen as an inferior lo gos just as anima in masculine psycholo gy is best described as an inferior eros 
the characteristics of logos  are defined as differentiation clarif ication discriminati on and detachment 
those of eros as interweaving and relatedness aninia  is further defined as a personification of the 
unconscious in general a bridge between the cons cious and the unconscious eastern and western views 
of the source of consciousness are contrasted the former sees cons ciousness as an effect of anima 
whereas the latter sees the unconscious as a deriva tive of consciousness fantasies ad their place in 
eastern and western thought are also  examined both reject fantasies  the former because they have 
already extracted their essence and c ondensed it in their teaching the latter because they have not even 
allowed themselves to experience these fantasies  references

the process of differentiating c onscious and unconscious subject a nd object unconscious and world is 
reviewed the primitive mentalit y is characterized by nondifferenti ation between subject and object 
referred to by levybruhl as participation my stique civilized  man retains his own form of 
nondifferentiation as is evident in an extended identification with pare nts affects or prejudices the 
resolution of this state of nondiffe rentiation is seen to require a recognition that both the unconscious 
and the conscious are determining f actors in ones psyche and that th e demands of both must be taken 
into account the center of gravit y of the total personality is then  no longer the ego but the self a 
hypothetical point between conscious  and unconscious the arrival at  this state of consciousness 
detached from the world is viewed as originat ing in middle life and intending to offer a natural 
preparation for death seen as the goal of life in the psychological perspective

the relationship of psychology to  metaphysics and religion is disc ussed eastern philosophers are 
described as symbolical ps ychologists metaphysics is criticized for ignoring the validity of the psyche 
the west neither can nor should deny its religious history in its search  for enlightment there is a vast 
difference in religious experien ce between eastern lack of pers onification and inwardness and the 
western emphasis on the human incarna tion of christ it is suggested however that the eastern belief 
that redemption depends on selfrealization be app lied to the imitation of christ rather than aping 
christs actions one should emulate the courage and se lfsacrifice with which christ arrived at his own 
selfrealization this goal this evaluation of a highe r consciousness is seen to involve a recognition of 
instincts and the unconscious  reference

the basic agreement of psyc hic states and religious symbolism of the east and west is emphasized here 
it is through these analogies that the east can be understood without a denial of the western history and 
heritage in exploring the analogies between east  and west conciousness will be broadened and a 
development in our own psyche will occur this brief conclusion is followed by illust rations of the

to the alchemical art the composit ion of liquids and the art of metals  the images of men being boiled in 
water dismembered or consumed by flames are inte rpreted to refer to the casting off of the body in

zosimos visions are interpreted as  the recording of a single highly si gnificant experience or dream that 
may have occurred during the work and revealed th e nature of the psychic processes in the background 
all the psychic contents th at the alchemists projected into the ch emical process are present in the vision 
especially the emphasis on the miraculous water a qua divina which was extracted from the lapis 
through the torment of fire the importance given to these dreams and alchemical  texts is explained by 
recalling that the symbolism of alch emy has a great deal to do with the structure of the unconscious and 
the biological compensati on produced by dreams  
 the visions of zosimos ii co mmentary  the sacrifical act  in jung c collected works

the numerous symbols in zosimos dream many of which are deta ils of archetypes are examined and 
compared with similar symbols in christian literature as well as in other alchem ical texts the image of 
the sacrificer who is also the sacrificed relates to the concept of christ sacrificing himself and to the 
image of the dragon biting his own tail it is a conti nuous circle of creation and destruction the head is 
a symbolical circle housing the soul  it was thought that by scalping or skinning the head the soul could 
be released from the body the circle consists of two parts outwardly it  is water inwardly it is the 
arcanum the head is the symbolic essence of cons ciousness which must be sacrificed for greater 
consciousness the images of the hermetic vessel and of the divine water are also explained the bowl 
shaped altar represents a wonder working vessel in which immersion takes place and transformation into 
a spiritual being is effected a sym bol of renewal or rebirth the wate r commonly associated with spirit

obvious illusion to the lapis the wholeness to be achieved by integrating the contents of the unconscious

the portion of the zosimos text called the introduction is examined as an example of a conscious 
allegory expressed in alchemical langua ge the abstracted spirits of the metals are pictured as suffering 
human beings a remnant of the prim itive and archaic psychology that pers onified lifeless things because 
of an unconscious identity with them this identificati on is the result of projec tion a process that allows 
the contents of the unconscious to become accessibl e to consciousness by repres enting them as qualities 
apparently belonging to the object  the difference between primitive and modem psychology is said to 
be qualitative as well as one of degree whereas civilized man develops consciousness by the acquisition 
of knowledge and withdrawal of proj ections recognized as psychic conten ts to be integrated into the 
psyche the alchemists personified all of their importa nt ideas thus man is represented as a microcosm

a complementary image of the christ figure a symbol  of the inner christ of god in man an overview 
of the stone symbol as it appeared in primitive societ ies is given it was as an image of the birthplace of 
the gods a container of childrens souls a source of  fertility and healing in a myth originating among 
the navaho indians the stone took the form of a ma triarchal goddess an anima figure representing the 
self particularly the self of a man living in a matriarchal soci ety who is still immersed in his 
unconscious femininity as can be seen even toda y in cases of masculine mother complexes the 
connection with immortality is  also shown to be very ancient the stone is a panacea an alexipharmic a

zosimos the divine water is analyzed as a re presentation of the death rebirth cycle the dialogue 
between christ and nicodemus is referred to as a po ssible parallel with zosimo s vision it is concluded

zosimos dream and its predominant sy mbol of the divine water is seen  as reflecting both an alchemical 
preoccupation and a psychological drama in the image of the divine water one finds the expression of 
the alchemical goal in the punishment torment d eath and transfiguration moti f one discovers how the 
process of change is manifested to human understandi ng it is in the mystical side of alchemy that 
parallels can be drawn to the psychological prob lem of individuation in the projections of the

and he who commands god the former side of his nature was revealed in his spirit uality the latter in 
his use of manticism magic amulets spells and talismans although parcelsus believed that he was at 
one with himself the analysis of his writings both in  their style and their voca bulary is seen to reveal

consisted of a knowledge of the ma teria medica and a chemical proc edure for preparing medicine as 
well as a belief in the possibility of making gold  and engendering the homunculi  it is concluded that

it was his belief in the light of nature that links h im most closely with the aim of alchemy to beget this 
light in the shape of the filius philosophorum this id ea of light coincides with the concept of sapientia 
or scientia although paracelsus is judged to have been unaware of th e ultimate insidiousness of this 
doctrine in which man takes the pl ace of god andthe forces of na ture serve man as never before

differences im plicit in his views in realit y he can be considered th e forerunner of the new reli gion of 
nature that was not only chemical and physical but also psychical  as  a physician he is credited with 
recognizing the important role that ps ychic occurrences play in diseases  and in their cures the goal of 
paracelsus and of all the philosophical alchemists is se en as an attempt to grasp the nature of the soul

diseases unlike the church with it s attempts to exorcise and banish demons the alchemists sought to

transformation of death and rebirt h unifying the opposites rather than denying the validty of one of 
them it is considered appropriate that paracelsus a nd the alchemists expressed themselves in parables

the functions of consciousness scaiolae and the role  of the anima melusina  the figure of melusina

recounted she appears at the moment of catastrophe as  a vision or dream to guide the adept out of the 
darkness of notknowing ma ny qualities attributed to her were al so characteristic of the alchemical 
mercurial serpent or the wise old man and mercur ius it is the inner man guided by the conscious 
functions and in search of the self that gives rise to the fantasy images of melusina the adept however 
must apply critical judgment to the visions and acts of  melusina anima in order to extract wisdom from 
the deceptive phantasms she presents  references

the process of reuniting the conscious and unconscious  in order to produce the one man is presented as 
it appears in paracelsus writings melusina the anima must not remain  in the projected state but must 
become integrated into the conscious mind of the ad ept thus producing the l onged after coniunctio of 
conscious and unconscious this union is defined as an  experience that cannot be stated in words but 
that is accompanied by a sense of eternity or timelessness allusion is made to the paracelsan 
description of the characters of venus and a comp arison is drawn between the union with the feminine 
personification of the unconscious an d the sacred marriage of the la mb and the virgin found in the

the reasons for parcelsus choice of the pagan imag es of venus and mars to describe the union of the 
conscious and the unconscious are discus sed despite the fact th at paracelsus lived in a christian age he 
chose pagan symbols to express his thoughts it is propos ed that in an era that neglected the natural spirit 
and expressed everything in the light of culture or reason nature was making her own demands 
paracelsus is credited with having r ecognized the light of nature and with  raising it to a principle in 
which the workings of the unconscious can be obser ved the importance of atte nding to the unconscious 
is stressed it is an autonomous entity capable of extending beyond consciousness and with its symbols 
anticipates future consciousness it  is capable also of correcting th e biases and aberrations of the 
conscious attitude  reference  paracelsus as a spiritual phenomenon  the commentar y of

paracelsus work is assessed in term s of its relation to christianity as an alchemist his language is seen 
to be an expression of renewed archetypal experience resulting fr om the projections of his own 
unconscious despite the fact that the procedure he  was describing was clearly intended to attain 
immortality his belief in the light of  nature enabled him to  express himself in terms of venus and amor 
rather than in the christian language of the s acraments of the church nevertheless though an 
alchemical philoso pher he is judged to be a christian who saw his art as a means of brin ging the divine

have neglected paracelsus the christian and physician  they have not denied that in paracelsus the 
christian and primitive pagan lived t ogether to form a conflicting whol e despite the conflict paracelsus 
is seen to have been spared the split between faith and knowledge that was to afflict later generations in

relation to the teachings of the alchemists in the ta le certain spontaneous stat ements of the unconscious

the still unconscious core of the personality it is concluded that the hero of the tale is profoundly 
unaware of his self the key to the personality of the hero is buried and imprisoned against its will 
several of the symbols are interprete d as references to the alchemical concepts of the four elements the 
spiritus vegetativus the alchemist magician who has imprisoned me rcurius the fact that mercurius 
iethe principle of individuation ha s been confined against his will is  taken as an indication that this 
principle was considered to be a source of evil a view held by schopenhauer and buddhist philosophy 
as well as by the christian doctrine of original sin however in that the spir it is only contained not 
banished it is concluded that the intent was to isol ate the spirit from the surrounding medium insofar as 
the spirit is called by the alchemic name mercuriu s identical with the german wotan it is concluded 
that the tale was of alchemical origin interpre ting the evil spirit as a pagan god forced into the 
underworld by christianity a nd morally disqualified in this sense  identification is established between

phenomena contained in alchemy the philologist reitzenstein is cred ited with having discovered the 
mythological and gnostic ideas imbedded in alchemy pa rticularly the doctrine of the anthropos with its 
redemptive role through pr actical experience and observation with the projections of patients it was 
possible to understand the primitive state of identity be tween subject and object or in the case of the 
alchemists the projections of the collective unconsci ous on metals the original sources for this study 
are fourfold the texts by ancient authors especially  greek and arabic texts dating from first to eighth 
centuries and edited by berthelot latin texts transl ated from arabic or hebr ew dating from the ninth

knowledge a kinsman of the ancient hermes alth ough not ungodly by nature the mercurial fire was 
believed to contain the fires of hell  which was considered to be a co mponent of the deity since god was 
a coincidence of opposites the locus of this mercuria l fire was thought to be the center of the earth 
where the heavenly spiritual powers are rearranged in the chthonic world of matter therefore this evil 
hell fire was considered to be identical in substance with its spiritual counterpart mercurius of course

nature of quicksilver under heat is examined and ex plained as an indication of the highly specialized 
projection of psychic content since the alchemists themselves identified this arcane substance as spirit

at length mercurius is presented as a symbol of all conceivable opposit es as a process of 
transformation as a dual goddevil im age and as a representation of the self the individuation process 
and the collective unconscious both christ and merc urius are viewed as archetypes the former of 
consciousness the latter of the unconscious bot h are preconscious autonomous images from which 
knowledge of psychic conditions can be  derived since the development of the christ image resulted in a 
strengthening of consciousness and a neglect of th e unconscious the compensatory tendencies of the 
latter created the figure of mercuriu s who stands in compensatory rela tion to christ and whose object is 
to bridge the abyss separating the conscious from the unconscious it is this new knowledge springing 
from the unconscious that mu st be integrated into consciousness in  order to complete the individuation 
process allow the emergence of the self and reveal th e collective nature of the self the evil dark side 
of mercurius is not to be interpreted as an image of the christian devil but of the shadow side of the self

the quotations from several alchemi cal texts are examined and the dang ers of practicing the alchemical 
art arc explored death either physi cal or spiritual and demonic agen ts are cited among the dangers for 
those who lacked spiritual unders tanding since the mystery of the stone pervades alchemy and was 
considered by the alchemists as a miracle it was consequently associated with a fear of mental 
disturbance a econd century chinese alchemists warnings of the dire consequences of making 
mistakes during the opus are described both in th eir physiological and psychic manifestations the 
alchemist was involved in the development of his ow n individuation in a diff icult process of unifying 
consciousness with the shadow and the anima he wa s exposed to the dangers of the demands made on 
both his intelligence and moral qualities  references

understanding as a means of defence  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  princeton 
university press   p p   
the need to defend against the power of the philoso phical stone was recognized by the alchemists they 
realized that the stone was stronge r than they and sought to try to understand it by attempting to guess 
the secret name the alchemists sought to gain power of  the dangerous force this process is seen to have 
its parallel in psychotherapy neurotic sympto ms can often be rendered harmless by conscious 
understanding and experience of thei r contents however it is important to remember the autonomous 
nature of these contents and recognize them as th e source of individuation just as the alchemists 
attempted to use the symbols produced by the uncons cious as spellbinding names so does modem man 
use intellectual concepts for the purpose of denyi ng the unconscious hopeful that reason and intellect 
can destroy its reality  reference

  p p   
the ambiguous meaning of torment in alchemical work is explore d it afflicts both the body and the 
soul the raw materials and the arcane substance of th e alchemists in their most  important discovery the 
alchemists projected their own ps ychic processes into chemical s ubstances therefore it is not 
surprising that suffering and sadness should have b een associated with the christs cross and its 
connection with the tree quaternity the symbol of the cross also applies to  the tree wherein four 
elements are united the analogies of the sword on th e tree and the serpent on the cross in mythological 
and christian tradition are discussed the snake repr esents two apsects of the unconscious its cold and 
ruthless instinctuality and its qualit y of natural wisdom in the snake symbolism christ personifies the 
unconscious hun g on the tree in sacrifice a sacrifice in which the unconscious is overcome

relation of suffering to the coniunctio  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  princeton

the relation of suffering to union  coniunctio  is examined a ccording to gnostic tradition the 
feminine figure of wisdom not pr imordial man was cast out into darkness the masculine element 
thereby escaped the danger of being swallowed up by the dark powers and from the sufferings of 
wisdom arose the entire created world this creation myth is interpreted as psychological representation 
of the separation of the female anima from the masc uline spiritually oriented consciousness which is 
seeking the victory of the spirit over the world of the senses wisdoms unconscious state its 
formlessness and darkness characterizes the anima of man who identifies himself absolutely with his 
reason and spirituality by his sepa ration from the aninia he risks th e loss of the comp ensating powers of 
the unconscious in such a case the latter makes itself  felt with violent emot ions and man loses touch 
with reality in the language of myth christ  the principle of masculine spirituality  perceives the 
suffering of wisdom the psyche  and thereby gives her form a nd existence she is however left to 
suffer in a parallel with masculine neuroses a ma n can perceive psychic suffering but may not become 
conscious of its reasons in the unc onscious masculine spirituality wit hdraws into the light and shuts out 
the darkness wisdom will not give up her dark emotions with the result that original unity is split into 
irreconcilable halves in this symbolism the qua ternity of two pairs of opposites again appears

tree as man  in jung c collected works of c g j ung vol  princeton university press  
 p p   
a concern with the conceptual relationship of tree to man has recurred throughout history the tree is 
seen as an intermediate form of man since on th e one hand it springs from primordial man and on the 
other grows into a man the feminine tree numen is an  accurate symbol of the self for women but for 
the alchemists it represented a projection of the anima figure when the anima mans femininity or the 
animus womans masculinity is not  sufficiently differentiated and integrated into consciousness the 
self is only potentially present the spontaneous pr oducts of the unconscious in modern man depict the 
archetype of the tree and the histor ical parallels not th e biblical associations  instead the tree image 
seems to portray an inner process of development independent of cons ciousness or will  references

the origins and treatment of psychic disturbances are reviewed treatmen t of such disturbances involves 
the integration of contents which have become disso ciated from consciousness  the more negative the 
conscious attitude the more aggressive the dissociat ed content becomes to be effective the therapy 
must establish communication with the splitoff part  in attempting to interpret a complex dream in 
an eagle reappeared recurrently it was discovered that the eagle was associated with the patients 
experiences in a concentration camp and with his basic beliefs since neur oses are symptoms of 
maladjustment the neurotic regression into an infant ile state can be analyzed by means of the symbols 
produced by the unconscious to compensate this  regression when thes e symbols are understood 
objectively a change in attitude occurs whereby the dissociation between man as he is and man as he 
ought to be is bridged the psyche needs to know the meaning of its existence of the images and ideas 
originating in the unconscious the conscious psyche is of a personal nature but it  is not the whole of the 
psyche dream symbols have a reality that rev eals unknown factors of the unconscious when their 
meaning is understood the unconscious can be integr ated and the dissociation overcome the study of 
the alchemical laborator y experiences of the theories and the  philoso phic tree is considered 
important because of the relevance of these di scoveries to the modem psychological study of the 
unconscious
