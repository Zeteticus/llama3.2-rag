 the role of the unconscious  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  nd ed 
princeton university pre ss   p p  
 the unconscious is discussed not as a mere psychologi cal construct but rather as  an integral part of 
mans psyche histo ry and world view the term unconscious was at first spurned by experimental 
psychologists who believed that ev erything psychic was conscious me dical men treating severe forms 
of psychopathology however found the unconscious to be a useful construct on the basis of empirical 
findings the concept of the unconscious as the sum tota l of all repressed desire s and forgotten memories 
gradually took form although freuds observation that most of the represssed content of consciousness 
has to do with sexuality is accepted his theory that sexuality is the fundamental  instinct and activating 
principle of the psyche is rejected as an anti quated reductionist single forced approach to an 
explanation of the unconscious  it is suggested that such theories  should be replaced by the view that 
psychological processes derive from a libidinal energy s ource that simply is the psyche is held to be 
no more explainable than life the unconscious is  divided into the personal and the collective 
unconscious the personal unconscious c onsists entirely of material ac quired during the individuals life 
whereas the collective unconscious is the psychic equiva lent of the inherited br ain structure not only 
does the unconscious store repressed ma terial but it also has a compen satory function any complex of 
experience systematically denied by  consciousness will build up in th e unconscious and eventually force 
its way into consciousness thus compensating fo r any onesidedness of conscious material the 
unconscious is also seen to have a symbol creating f unction in that it is the wellspring of instinct and 
intuition evidence of the working of these two f unctions compensation and symbol creation are seen 
not only in the individual but in societies and nati ons the french revolution and the decline of rome 
are used as examples of their oc currence on the national level  
  mind and earth  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  nd ed princeton 
university press   p p   
 the influence of the earth on mans mind is e xplored with the mind understood as a system of 
adaptation determined by the conditions of an earthy existence both the conscious and the unconscious 
parts of the mind are considered and the latter is seen  as the larger and more chthonic part the contents 
of the unconscious the archetypes are considered to be the hidden foundation s of the conscious mind 
they are inherited with the brain stru cture and reveal the link with the ea rth as well as wi th the ancestral 
past containing memories of experiences that ha ve occurred over and over again the suggestion is 
made that every psychic reaction that is out of  proportion to its precip itating cause should be 
investigated in order to determine if it has been conditioned by an archetype the investigation of a 
childs unreasonable fears leads to a discussion of fair ytale motifs and childish fears as examples of the 
way in which the psyche expresses the biogeneti c law that ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny the same 
example is also used to illustrate the differences be tween the freudian and jungian views of the origin o f 
neurosis in children the former puts the onus on th e childs sexual instincts while the latter sees the 
childs mind as a psychic appendage of the parents  the universal experience of the mother and the 
father is considered to be the most basic archetype and the sec ond most influential one is that of the 
opposite sex as man has perceived and experienced wo man throughout the ages and viceversa so too 
will the individual man expect to encounter wo man a discussion of the animus in woman and the 
in man clarifies this theory the colonization of nort h america is used to illu strate the way in which 
primitive archetypes have influenced  the development of a specific cult ure and civilization  reference  
  archaic man  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  nd ed princeton 
universit y press   p p    
 the psychology of primitive man is studied and his prelogical state compared to the conscious outlook 
of civilized man from personal obser vations of primitive societies it is concluded that primitive men 
think feel and perceive in the same manner as civiliz ed men but differ from them in the way in which 
they account for events the primary assumptions of  primitive men place them  in a different world 
primitives do not see things differently than we do it is their pr esuppositions that are different for the 
civilized man all events can be e xplained by natural or perceptible causality for the primitive man 
events are explained in terms of i nvisible arbitrary supernatural pow ers primitive man is so strongly 
impressed by and adapted to things as they are that a transgression of the laws of his world frighten him 
and demand a better explanation than that afforded by mere happenstance or na tural causality primitive 
mans belief in arbitrary supernatural powers is c onsidered to be based in part on his psychological 
tendency to project his own unconscious psychic cont ents onto the physical world so completely that 
they cannot be distinguished from objective physica l events thus through what levybruhl has termed 
the participation mystique primitive man is cont ained physically and psychi cally in his world in 
constrast civilized man believes that  he is separate from nature and in  possession of an individual soul 
thus modem man must deprive nature of psychic real ity and in order to see his world objectively deny 
all his archiac projections in considering primitives  belief in the supernatural magic and mana one is 
forced to ask if the psyche the s oul of the unconscious originated in  man or if in early stages of 
conscious evolution it existed in itself and was gra dually embodied in what is called the human psyche 
if the premise is granted that psychic contents once existed independently it is possible to conclude that 
human individuality is the accidental product of forces contained in the objective environment  
  the spiritual prob lem of modern man  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  
nd ed princeton university press   p p   
the spiritual crisis of post world war i europe evid ent in the widespread public interest in psychology 
and eastern thought is recognized a nd analyzed the recent emergence of the new science of psychology 
is explained as the result of the loss of a structure or external form to express the yearnings and hopes of 
the soul in the past a living religion provided this fo rm consequently the psyche could appear to exist 
outside of man and psychological problems reduced to a minimum world war i however not only 
shattered the europeans illusion that the christian millennium of peace and harmony could be attained 
and that psycic forces could be c ontained but it also destroyed his fa ith in himself the confrontation 
with unconscious psychic forces resulted in a quest  for knowledge that led to a rediscovery of 
parapsychology spiritualism easter n thought and astrology most impor tantly it has stimulated an 
interest in psychology as a science that can assist man in dealing with the spiritual crisis that besets him 
other sociological signs of the ps ychological situation of modem man such as the rediscovery of the 
body and the ideal of internationalism are viewed as  symptoms along with his fascination with psyche 
that will lead to a reassessment of fundamental human nature and a high le vel of consciousness  
  the love problem of a student  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  nd ed 
princeton university press   p p   
 the numerous forms of love relationships and the va rious solutions to the problem of sex and love are 
surveyed these questions are evaluated in terms of  their contribution to th e students psychological 
development marriage the most commonly accepted form of expressi on has traditionally been denied 
to the student for a number of reasons the most immediate being that the student cannot support a 
family the recent increase in student marriages is at tributed to psychological changes in contemporary 
man and to the increased use of contraceptives the psychological changes ar e traced to spiritual 
upheavals that resulted in a profo und change in mans selfconcept now viewing himself as part of 
nature and therefore subject to sc ientific scrutiny modem man has a ccepted the finding of analytic 
psychology that sexuality plays a major role in  human psychology the problems surrounding student 
marria ges are discussed with em phasis placed on the sexual and psycholo gical differences between 
young men and women the importance of integrating th e sexual complex into th e whole personality is 
also noted other forms of relations hips between the sexes during the student years are also examined 
the psychological value of such liaisons is believ ed to depend on the existence of love along with 
sexuality whereas their transitoriness is seen as inhibiting the development of mature sexuality the 
advantages and disadvantages of homosexual relations are discussed the possible educative value of 
such a relationship between an older man and younger one if accompanied with loyalty and 
steadfastness is acknowledged lesbian relationships are viewed as valuable in terms of affectivity and 
intimacy but dangerous to psychologi cal development in reinforcing ma sculine traits liaisons between 
a young male student and an olde r woman are briefly commented on as are platonic relationships 
abstinence and masturbation the utopian solutions of  free love and trial ma rriage are dismissed as 
wishful fantasies it is observed that true love se eks commitments and sacrifices the illusion that other 
possibilities exist  
  woman in europe  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  nd ed princeton 
university press   p p   
 the psychological change in post world war i eur opean woman and its societal ramifications are 
examined modern woman is seen to be in a state of  transition the european psyche torn to shreds by 
the war is seeking to establish a new balance between the conscious and the unconscious the modem 
womans ego conditioned over the ages by the sexual pa ttern to be submissive  is stimulated by the 
animus unconscious masculine traits in the female psyche to assert it self this is manifested in the 
dramatic increase in the number of women pursui ng masculine careers the conscious reaction to the 
unconscious influence of the animus is a psychologi cal need for a relationship traditional marriage 
however is too restrictive for modern woman and hence the marriage problem arises the surplus of 
marriageable women the spread of contraceptives a nd the increasing demand by women to be free have 
all contributed to the weakening of the instituti on of marriage what th e future psychological 
relationship between the sexes will  be is the fundamental question of the marriage problem eros 
psychic relatedness characterizes the feminine ps yche logos objective interest characterizes the 
mans each however has elements of the other in  him which previously unconscious are now coming 
to the fore though harmful to the psychological deve lopment of the individual this constitutes an 
evolutionary step for the species modem woman is t hus seen as weakening marriage in order to change 
it the woman who follows the law of her being and takes up this task of tr ansforming society will find 
herself caught between two univers als historic inertia and th e divine urge to create  
  the meaning of psychology for modern man  in jung c collected works of c g jung 
vol  nd ed princeton universi ty press   p p   
popular misconceptions about psycholo gy are discussed as a prelude to an exposition of the basic tenets 
of psychology the common assumption th at everyones psychology is the sa me contradicted by clinical 
experience led to an investigation of the basis for this belief it was discove red that primitive man is 
characterized by a group psychology though modern man ha s learned to differenti ate himself from this 
group mentality individual consciousness still must develop out of the collective unconscious with 
individual consciousness however came discontent this discontent is seen as an unconscious reaction 
to the stress produced by differentiation it is an ax iom of psychology that ev ery psychic phenomenon is 
compensated for by another thus the discontent of th e present age can be seen as the tension produced 
by evolution through the synthesis of opposites the problem modern man has with psychology is that 
he refuses to admit its basic tenet that the ps yche transcends man and is ultimately unknowable 
instead of demanding from psychology a cure for his discon en  modem man is better advised to look 
within himself for th germ of unity dreams the spont aneous products of the psyche that compensate for 
the onesidedness of the conscious mind are guides to  the workings of the unconscious their correct 
interpretation is an invaluable aid in the assimilation of unconscious contents b y the conscious mind 
the art of dream inte rpretation is discussed it is concluded that no one method for interpretation is 
applicable to all dreams  reference  
  the state of psychotherapy today  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  nd 
ed princeton university pr ess   p p   
an overview of earlier psychotherape utic techniques is provided and ps ychotherapists are challenged to 
reassess and change their methods of  treatment in order to do full justice to the human psyche warring 
schools of psychology with their multiplicity of tec hniques are testimony to the multifaceted nature of 
psychology and the evils of the onesided doctrinaire  approach to psychothe rapy it is considered 
impossible for psychotherapeutic techniques to be uniformly applied to indi viduals the fundamental 
rule of therapy is to c onsider each case as new and unique to do this the therapist must be free of 
restrictive theoretical presuppositio ns reductionist theories concerni ng the nature of the unconscious 
and its role in neurosis egfreudi an adlerian are criticized in that  they view neurosis only as an 
aberration thus depriving the patient of the compen satory function of the unconscious effected through 
neurosis the art of the analyst lies in the ability to  lead the patient to an understanding of his neurosis 
thus allowing him to assimilate th e appropriate contents from his unconscious re ligions are seen as 
psychoanalytic systems that express the whole range of psychic problem s in mighty images they are the 
avowal and recognition of the soul th e revelation of the souls nature th is view of religion is contrasted 
with the view found in freud s future of an illusion

 in a preface to a series of essays on contemporary events the psychotherapists need to come to grips 
with world situations is explained in terms of the effects of social and political upheaval on the psychic 
life of the individual in response  to that need these essays contai n reflections on and reactions to the 
historical events and situations of the years between  and  misunderstandings that arose over 
these essays are answered in an epilogue that co llects fragments from other writings dealing with the 
same themes  
  wotan  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  nd ed princeton university 
press   p p   
 the national socialist nazi move ment in germany is explained in terms of the reawakening of the 
psychic forces symbolized by the ancient german  god wotan although it is ad mitted that political 
economic and psychological factors each explain certain facets of th e movement quite well it is 
maintained that the movement is best understood in te rms of the repossession of the german soul by the 
archetype wotan this prechristia n god of the german people was repr esented as a restless wanderer 
an unleasher of passions and lust fo r battle a magicians vessel in the occult a god of storm and frenzy 
the effects of such an archetypal autonomous factor are examined in the collective life of a people 
several fragments from nietzsches writings are viewed as an anticipat ion of wotans return extensive 
references to books by martin nick and wilhelm haue r dealing respectively with the myth of wotan 
and the german faith movement are used to e xplicate wotans origins and his impact on modem 
german religion members of the german faith m ovement were urged to recognize that wotan not 
christ is the true god of the german people hitler is  seen as an agent of wotan as a possessed man 
who has infected a nation thus the german people are seen to be victims rather  than active agents of 
evil it is predicted that wotan in time will show the other side of his nature   the ecstatic mantic side 
 and that the national socialist move ment will not be the last word  
  after the catastrophe  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  nd ed princeton 
university press   p p   
 in an attempt to explain the psychological factors re sponsible for the horrors of nazi germany it is 
argued that europe produced germa ny that germany was but the crys tallizing point for social and 
spiritual upheavals permeating all of europe and that  all of europe shares germanys guilt certain 
social conditions eg mass unemploym ent urbanization and dependence on the state are seen to have 
exacerbated the german predisposition to feelings  of inferiority this inferiority complex was 
manifested in overcompensation and in a whole nexus of pathological features that were flagrantly 
displayed in the person of adolf hitler hitler is described as the incarnation of the average german 
the german people saw in hitler the reflected image of their collective hysteria by hysteria is meant 
that the opposites inherent in every psyche are furt her apart than normal resulting in a higher energic 
tension and a disposition towards inne r disharmonies goethes faust is ci ted as a perfect example of this 
side of the german nature germanys pact with th e devil is said to lie in her abandonment of the 
spiritual for the material with niet zsches proclamation that god is d ead the projected psychic image of 
god returned to its origin and produc ed a feeling of god almightiness  that led the german people to 
disaster the moral problem facing europe is defined as a need to  discover new sanctions for goodness 
and justice now that they can no longer be found in the metaphysics of religion it is concluded that 
europe must understandand accept its co llective guilt and learn to live with the dark shadow that has 
been uncovered in its collective psyche  reference  
  the fight with the shadow  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  nd ed 
princeton university press   p p   
 the historical events in germany from  to   are explained in terms of mass psychology and 
compensation the former is viewed as the magnifie d psychology of the individual and is established as 
the starting point for this explanati on the latter the concept of compensation is then evoked to explain 
the disturbances that were noted in the unconscious of every single german patient from as early as 
 the images of violence noted in the dreams of  these patients are explained as an unconscious 
reflection of the many ills of ge rman social life eg mass une mployment national humiliation 
urbamzation etc as the dark images of the uncons cious broke into consciousness archetypes of order 
were formed in the unconscious as compensation it is predicted that this desire  for order was exploited 
by national socialism and that hitlers attraction resi ded in the fact that he symbolized something from 
everybodys unconscious he represented the shadow th e inferior part of everyones personality the 
germans did not recognize the incarna tion of their shadow in hitler since they denied its existence 
altogether to avoid falling victim to  the exteriorized shadow of th e inner psyche in the form of 
demagoguery it is considered esse ntial to recognize ones own shadow and to fight against its 
overwhelming power drive for both so ciety and state derive their qualit y from the mental condition of 
the individual

 p p   
 the threats to the individual in modern society ar e examined as coming from two sources the latent 
psychosis of a subver sive minority and scientific rationalism the former are subject to collective 
excitement and are ruled by wish fantasies the la tter reduces all individual events including man to a 
con ceptual average the normal persons unconscious that broad area of psychic activity that is 
immune to conscious control and cr iticism i is open to the influe nce of the subversive minority via 
unconscious psychic infection the psychol ogical effect of the sc ientific statis tical world view is that the 
in dividual is replaced by conceptual units that are  in turn lumped into mass forms the state is an 
abstract entity con structed to represent the sum tota l of these forms in the at tempt to compensate for 
the chaotic formlessness of society an infalliable le ader is produced who then becomes a victim of his 
own inflated ego consciousness this sequence of events  is inevitable once the individual combines with 
the mass and suppresses the development of selfhood or individual uniqueness

 the true nature of religion as an  expression of an interpersonal relationship with an authority higher 
than that of the state is examined this belief is  seen as a thrust to ma ss mindedness and explains the 
attempts of totalitarian sociopol itical movements to supplant religion evidence for the function of 
religion as a counterbalance to ma ss mindedness is found in the atte mpts of all so cialpolitical 
movements to supplant religion the state robs the individual of his dignity by depriving him of the 
metaphysical grounds for his existence the individual  through awareness of a reciprocal relationship 
between man and an extramundane authority receives the foundati on for his freedom and autonomy 
parallels are drawn between the workings of the soviet  regime and established re ligions to illustrate how 
the state takes over religious functions in general terms the state attempts to convert the masses from 
extramundane beliefs and goals to worldly ones

  p   
 the totalitarianism of the communist state is ex amined in terms of individual development and is 
judged to be antithetical to such development the main threat posed to the west by the communist 
countries is considered to be that of psychi c infection the ideological  fanaticism displayed by 
communists is compared to religious  fanaticism and in fact is seen as a substitute for religious faith 
idealism and reason are powerless in the face of such conviction it is suggested that an equally potent 
faith is needed to check the spread of communism a fa ith antithetical to materialism such a faith must 
be derived from inner experience in order to with stand critical examination modern christianitys 
tendency to crumble under marxist attack is seen as resulting from the uncriti cal acceptance by so many 
christians of the literal inter pretation of its m ytholo gy a symbolic understandin g of these m yths 
corroborated by experience and feel ing would enable christianity to withstand the collision with 
rationalism unreflected belief and unqua lified faith be they in a reli gion or the state are viewed as 
diminishing the individuals freedom and increasing his vulnerability to external controls the west is 
seen as having nothing to offer modern man as a brace against materialism america with its 
educational system that places a premium on the sc ientific world view the  necessary precondition for 
materialism and with its rootless population is particularly vulnerable to  communism europe though 
possessing an historic and humanisti c type of education uses it to  her own undoing in the form of 
nationalistic egoism and para lyzing skepticism it is concluded that both need an idea that will reinstate

 the difficulties that man encounters in trying to understand himself are exam ined and the role of 
psychology in facilitating selfknow ledge is assessed si nce man is a unique phenomenon with nothing 
to which he can compare himself it is understandable that he knows so little of  his true worth the task 
then of explaining man to himsel f has fallen to psychology two misc onceptions about the psyche stand 
in need of correction before psychology can fulfill it s purpose it must be understood that the psyche is 
not merely a biochemical epiphe nomenon nor an entirely persona l phenomenon an understanding of 
the psyche in its only apparent ma nifestation the individual is the prime goal of psychology obstacles 
to this understanding of the indivi dual are seen to spring from both church and science the former 
demands adherence to certain coll ective beliefs the latter require s uniformity thus making it more 
difficult to arrive at a correct appreciation of th e human psyche the greatest obstacle however is 
considered to be the individuals fear of discove ring himself particularly in the realm of the 
unconscious this fear is evident in the founder of  psychoanalysis freud himself who defended the 
petrification of his sexual theory into dogma on the grounds that it was the sole bulwark of reason 
against a possible eruption of th e black flood of occultism that might result from the complete 
investigation of the unconscious modem man cannot affo rd to avert his eyes from the unconscious if he 
is to discover the truth about hi mself and thus meet the spiritual challenge of his day medical 
psychology is seen as a means by which the individual in his uniqueness is able to arrive at knowledge 
and understanding of his impulses hi s unconscious contents his instincts and his inner experiences it is 
necessary to take into account the archetypal elements of the individua l psyche if medical psychology is 
to achieve its aim of revealing man to himself

 the gap between faith and knowledge religion a nd philosophy the conscious and the unconscious is 
viewed as symptomatic of the split consciousness in modem society and explanatory of the search for a 
new life philosophy the question of a philosophy of life only arises when conditions of existence 
change so rapidly that a tension between outer situations and inner beli efs is created neither 
denominational religions nor the increasingly rationalistic modern philosophy serves to resolve the 
tension it is the psychologist who is faced with  the task of uniting the opposites of readapting the 
primordial images that maintain the flow of in stinctive energy modern man preoccupied with his 
conscious at the expense of his unconscious is judged to  have become estranged fr om his instincts this 
separation from instinct leads to conflicts between the conscious  and the unconscious spirit and nature 
faith and knowledge as a result of this rift between  faith arid knowledge with in the individual psyche 
most men suppress one or the other in order to establish a conscious harm ony by artificial means 
creatin g fanatical alliance to political ideolo gy on the one hand and blind adherence to the literal 
interpretation of religious mythology on the other th e unconscious is viewed as a counterbalance to the 
conscious it is a second psychic authority that may very well provide the individual with the religious 
experience that would justify the religious attitude and release modern rationalistic man from 
domination by the ego

medium in which one can experience god underes timating the psychological factor is considered 
harmful for the future of man not only will ignoran ce of the unconscious depriv e him of the religious 
experience it will also blind him to his capacity for evil hence making it possible for this evil to be 
projected and depriving him of his capacity to deal with  it these reflections lead to the realization of the 
psychological duality of human nature  it is considered essential that  he recognize the shadow side in 
order to promote real human relati onships between individuals and inne r cohesion within society it is

renewal accompanying this metamorphosis is evident in  modem art a symptom and a symbol of the age 
as growth in selfknowledge has s hown the shadow or the inferior pa rt of the psyche contains great 
potentialities whether the irruption of these forces into the conscious mind will result in growth or 
catastrophe is seen to depend entirely upon the prep aredness of the conscious mind to assimilate these 
forces the task of the individual is to prepare hims elf for the acceptance of hi s totality only a genuine 
transformation of the individual wi ll produce meaningful changes in the race since the individual who

edition introductory  in jung c collected works of c  g jung vol  ne ed princeton 
university press   p p   
 the rumors of unidentified flying objects ufos and their po ssible existence are seen to be events of 
such profound significance that an examination of their possible psychic consequences is deemed 
necessary the publics prolonged uncertainty over th e nature of ufos is seen to have provoked 
conscious and unconscious fantasies it is noted that it is hard to determine whether a primary perception 
is followed by phantasma or whether conversel y a primary fantasy originating in the unconscious 
invades the conscious mind with il lusions and visions in addition to these two causal relationships 
there is the third hypothesis that ufos are a sync hronistic phenomenon ie an acausal meaningful 
coincidence the work is not intended as an au thoritative pronouncement on the physical reality of 
ufos but rather an exploration of the psychic concomitants of this phenomenon the question of why 
most men would prefer to believe that uf os exist will be especially examined  
  flying saucers a modern myth of things  seen in the skies  ufos as rumours  in jung 
c collected works of c g jun g vol  nd ed princeton universit y press   p p 
  
 flying saucers are treated and anal yzed as products of th e psyche rumors for the purposes of this 
chapter it is assumed that ufo reports are mistaken  observations into which the observer has projected 
his own unconscious background since a psychic projection presupposes a psychic cause it is deduced 
that the world wide occurrence of ufo sightings point s to a universal psychic motive for the creation of 
the ufo rumor this motive is held to be the extr eme degree of emotional te nsion that all mankind feels 
as a result of todays precarious world situation the principles of dream interpretation are applied to 
analyzing the details of the ufo rumor it is conc luded that ufos represent a combination of mans 
archetypal images of both god and himself it is  then hypothesized that the world situation which 
threatens mans survival as a species has create d a desire for a heavenly salvation modern mans 
rationalism will not allow him to  voice this desire consciously and therefore has necessitated the 
projection of this unconscious mate rial the desire for supramundane salvation is expressed somewhat 
literally in the rumors of ufos th ese have just the tight technological veneer to make them palatable to 
the mind of modem man it is concluded  then th at ufos are modem myths as such they are 
essentially products of an unconsci ous archetype and therefore sy mbols that require psychological 
interpretation  reference  
  flying saucers a modern myth of things  seen in the skies  ufos in dreams  in jung c 
collected works of c g jung vol  nd ed princeton university press   p p   
 seven dreams involving ufos are presented and analyz ed the premise for this undertaking is that the 
analysis of dreams reveals the image in its unconscious  associative context and t hus aids in determining 
the meaning of the psychic phenome non of the ufo myth both freuds observations on the role of the 
sexual instinct in dreams and adlers theories concerning the will to pow er are used in the analyses the 
significance of the dreams is never reduced to the level of mere illu sions begotten by repressed sexuality 
or an overcompensated inferiority complex each dream is interpreted in relation to the life situation of 
the dreamer many of the dream images reveal simi larities to alchemical and religious symbols or 
contain instinctual and ar chetypal material the dreams of all but one individual were observed to 
manifest some aspect of the spiritual crisis of our ag e the lone exception is included to illustrate that 
symbols cannot be interpreted in a uniform way  generally the appearance of ufos in dreams 
symbolizes some content of the collective unconscious trying to break into consciousness to compensate 
for a onesidedness that has developed there it is c oncluded that the message th at the ufo brings to the 
dreamer is a reminder of his own soul and his own wholeness a response to modern mass mindedness

 three modern paintings plates of which are included in  the text are analyzed in  order to further clarify 
the psychic nature of the ufo phenomenon paintings we re chosen for this investigation because they 
have traditionally given visible shape to the dominant trends of their age the fragmentation of objects 
and loss of beauty in modern pain tings for example are interpreted as the artists response to the 
destructive forces at play in our age it is suggested  that these apocalyptic forces are the cause of modern 
mans desire for a heavenly intervention symbolical ly expressed in the ufo myth the central symbol 
of the second picture of a series the fire sower by e jacoby resembles the fiery ball of ufo reports 
it is interpreted as a uniting symbol that brings togeth er the desire for salvation and the fear of disaster 
in the third picture p birkhausers the fourth dimension the unconscious arrangement of the elements 
suggests that ufos are subliminal contents or ar chetypal figures that have become visible the 
abstraction of the fourth picture an untitled paintin g by yves tan guy is seen to have a psycholo gical 
effect akin to that of a rorschach test by cutti ng off an objective understanding of the picture the artist 
has forced the viewer to fall back on his subjective  feelings about it the powers of the unconscious to 
which the picture appeals are thus  strengthened as though by chance there appear in the chaos of 
possibilities unexpected ordering prin ciples that have the closest affi nities with the timeless psychic 
dominants of the unconscious

  p p   
 a cursory survey of preth century references to ufos is presented along with an interpretive 
summary of the dreams and pictures of the two pre ceding chapters four illust rative plates reproducing 
two th century broadsheets a th century woodc ut and a th century ma nuscript illustration are 
included in the text they all depict  unusual celestial happe nings taken as historical precedents for the 
modem ufo phenomenon from these plates the dream ex amples and paintings presented earlier it is 
concluded that the unconscious in order to portray its  contents makes use of certain fantasy elements 
that resemble ufo phenomena thei r careful scrutiny reveals a meani ngful content described as an 
epiphany these epiphanies are expressed in symbols that  unite antithetical pairs five such pairs that 
appear repeatedly in the examples of these three chapters are discussed reflections on their meaning 
leads to the conjecture that living ma tter has a psychic aspect and that the psyche has a physical aspect 
this hypothesis is said to be in accord with e xperience and to be a welcomed step away from 
psychophysical parallelism towards a model of the worl d that is closer to the idea of unus mundus

psychological light  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  nd ed princeton university 
press   p p   
 the physical reality of ufos is discussed and im plications are drawn for the psychological theories 
advanced in the previous chapters discussing th e phenomena of unidentif ied flying objects from 
information provided by rupplet fo rmer head of the american air forces ufo study group and from 
the failure of professor menzel a ufo sceptic to provide a scientific expl anation for authentic ufo 
sightings it is concluded that ufos have some unknown physical basis this claim does not negate the 
previous theories that assume ufos to be mistaken  observations instead their physical existence is 
understood to afford the opportuni ty for mythological projections the ufo phenomenon is explained 
in terms of its significance in the current histor ical situation political social philosophical and 
religious conflicts of unprecedented pr oportions are seen to have split the consciousness of our age it is 
a psychological fact that between opposites a symbol  of unity and wholene ss arises spontaneously 
when this symbol cannot reach consciousness it will  be projected onto any extraordinary event that 
might occur in the external world the carrier of this symbol is then invested with numinous and 
mythological powers the ufo phenomen on is explained on this basis it is concluded that the psychic 
situation of mankind and the ufo phenomenon as a physical reality bear no recognizable causal 
relationship to one another but that they do seem to coincide in a meaningful manner  
  flying saucers a modern myth of th ings seen in the skies  epilogue  in jung c 
collected works of c g jung vol  nd ed princeton university press   p p   
 three books dealing with ufos a nd published while flyi ng saucers was being written are reviewed 
in the epilogue to a series of articles on flying saucers  the first work the secr et of the saucers is a 
description of orfe o angeluccis personal experiences with extrat errestrial beings the author is said to 
have become a preacher of the gospel of ufos his account describes unint entionally but perfectly 
both the m ystic ex perience associated with ufos and the psychic process of individuation the second 
book the black cloud by astrophysicist fred hoyle is admittedly a science fiction yarn viewed 
psychologically it is a description of fantasy conten t whose symbols demonstrate their origin in the 
unconscious interpreted symbolically its plot depict s the struggle of unconscious contents to become 
conscious its denouement is faithful to the psychological truth that fail ure to assimilate the contents of 
the unconscious into the conscious mind results in a return to ones former state both books though 
totally different in their viewpoints and style are judged to be activated by the same unconscious factor 
and to make use essentially of the same symbol ism the third novel is john wynhams the midwich 
cuckoos also a science fiction stor y in which mans reaction to the di scovery of superior humanoids is 
portrayed these more advanced beings are credited with increased knowledge without a 
correspondingly advanced higher level of feeling or morality paradoxi cally these more highly evolved 
people exhibit the primitive particip ation mystique this lack of indi viduation is seen  to reflect the 
condition of man in the uniform marxist society hen ce the seemingly negative ending may be open to 
positive interpretation  reference  
  a psychological view of conscience  in jung c colllected works of c g jung vol  
nd ed princeton university press   p p   
 the concept of conscience  is explored in terms of  its relation to the moral code and to psychological 
reality the etymology of the word conscience suggests a special kind of consciousness a knowledge of 
the emotional value judgement attached  to actions however it is sugge sted that it is not the empirical 
subject but an unconscious personality that is the knower and that behaves like a conscious subject 
conscience then is theorized to be an inherite d archetypical behavior pa ttem freuds concept of 
conscience as the unconscious superego uniquely acqui red by each individual is contrasted with this 
hypothesis and judged inadequate freuds superego is seen to be identical with the prevailing moral 
code and though it is admittedly difficult to separate  the two conscience opera tes autonomously and is 
considered to be anterior to the moral code materi al from a case history is pr esented demonstrating that 
the conscience is a function of an autonomous psychi c factor and has a dual nature iea right and a 
wrong conscience coexist showing more clearl y than any other psychic phenomenon the polarity of 
the psyche conscience is explained as the collision of consciousness  with a numinous archeytpe as 
such it is both a moral and an ethi cal manifestation moral when it produces behavior that furrows the 
moral precepts of the community ethi cal when it is in accord with the deepest foundations of the self as 
in the case of conflict of duty  reference  
  good and evil in analytical psychology  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  
nd ed princeton university press   p p   
the question of the meaning of good and evil and their role in psyc hotherapeutic treatment is discussed 
good and evil are defined as principles that are unknow able in their deepest reality and that form the 
basis of our ethical judgments as principles wh en reduced to their ontological roots they are 
considered to be the beginning aspects of god a s upraordinate reality mightier than the individual the 
psychotherapist is required to deal empirically  with good and evil although that does not imply 
relativizing the principles as suc h nevertheless he must  deal with good and evil in terms of the 
individual not as a moral code for the reality of these two concepts can only be perceived and 
apprehended in specific things and situations whereas conventional mo rality like the principles of 
physics is only statistically valid a brief discussion of the eastern attitude to wards good and evil leads 
to the conclusion that the healthy individual is one who is capable of seeing bot h the light and the dark 
side of his nature simultaneously thus be ing freed of the control of the opposites  
  introduction to toni wolffs studies in jungian psychology  in jung c collected 
works of c g jun g vol  nd ed princeton universit y press   p p    
 in the introduction to wolffs studies in jungian psychology several of the problems discussed in the 
book as being endemic to analytic psychology are review ed one such problem is seen to arise from the 
fact that a large part of the therapeutic work in analytic psychology takes place on the collective level 
and thus avoids a discussion of individual difference s another is that the an alyst often uses his own 
prejudice as the criterion for normali ty as president of the psychologi cal club of zuric h wolff noticed 
that it is the nature of groups to entice their memb ers into mutual imitation and dependence she used 
observations of the workings of her own club as the ba sis for several essays that  deal in general with 
group psychology and in particular with how the group reduces indivi dual consciousness  
  the swiss line in the european spectrum  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol 
 nd ed princeton university press   p p   
 count hermann keyserlings book the spectrum of europe is reviewed with special emphasis on 
his assessment of switzerland the chief value of this book is seen to be that it argues against the purely 
rational point of view keys erling advocates a return to a psychol ogical view of the world where nations 
are seen as functions of a great indivisible man this  cosmic view of humanity is judged to be basically 
idealistic not to say i l metaphysical and is indi sputable proof of keyserlings remotness from the 
earth keyserlings criticism of switzerland as the most backward conservative stiffnecked self
righteous smug and churlish of all eu ropean nations is admitted to be essentially cortect however as 
such it is the psychological and geogr aphical center of the european in its connection with the past and 
its neutrality switzerland is called the center of gravity for europe  keyserlings transformation of 
nations into functions destroys thei r fictitious substance and places them into the context of a functional 
system where the needs of the whol e of europe are to be considere d men everywhere are urged not to 
attempt to change the character of their resp ective nations but rather to transcend it  
  the rise of a new world  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  nd ed 
princeton university press   p p   
count hermann keyserlings book america set free is  reviewed and judged to be as concerned with 
europe as it is with america  keyserling sees america with eu ropean prejudices and hence the 
objective accuracy of many of his observations and c onclusions are considered suspect nevertheless 
they are viewed as important refl ections about european sensibility the books subtitle the rise of a 
new world the theme of the work is seen as refe rring not only to america but to the entire western 
world keyserting is considered to be the mouthpiece of the collective spirit his prophecy about the rise 
of a new consciousness a new worl d view is accepted as an accurat e though unintentional assessment 
of the change taking place deep within modem mans unconscious many quotations from the book are 
included in the review to give the flavor and scope of keysertings obs ervations particul ar attention is 
given to keyserlings views that amer ica does not yet have a soul that it  is a land of the overrated child 
that the high living standard is the mainspring of its morality it is suggested that the comments on the 
relation of the sexes on the family and on the de masculization of men and the masculinization of 
women have much to contribute to the european view s of these subjects keyserling is credited with 
having understood that the world is entering into an era that places understanding above faith and 
experience above creeds what  he has to say about the relation of the sexes in america is held to be 
particularly interesting  
  la revolution mondiale  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  nd ed 
princeton university press   p p   
 count hermann keyserlings book la revolution mondiale is reviewed and though written in 
french is judged to be german in spirit chin ese characters with their capacity for vagueness and 
implications of the infini te are seen to be the best medium for ex pressin g the flashes of intuition that are 
typical of his mind the book is considered to be a record of keyserlings reactions to contemporary 
events the spiritual and the telluric are the cont rapuntal poles of the book and modem man is seen to 
be living through a world change effected by their reversal keyser ting proposes that man saves what 
he can of his spiritual heritage by resurrecting the idea of the cultur al monastery he is criticized for 
assuming that everything in the end can be understood the spirit  may have been overcome by the 
telluric in order to be reborn but keyserling must be understood symbolically a nd literally for only then 
can he be recognized as the spokesman of  the zeitgeist of the spiritual man  
  the complications of american psychology  in jung c collected works of c g jung 
vol  nd ed princeton universi ty press   p p   
 explanations for the peculiarities of american ps ychology as they appear to a european observer are 
advanced americans are seen to have a tendenc y toward collectivity se xual promiscuity kinetic 
looseness and emotional expressiveness not only are americans observed to differ psychologically 
from their european ancestry but also anatomically th ese differences are attributed to two factors the 
coexistence of the negro and the caucasian races in america and the influence of the land on its 
inhabitants it is proposed that the temperament of a pr imitive race is highly c ontagious in that it 
appeals to the unconscious of the more advanced  race and thus spreads through temperamental and 
mimetic infection the negros infl uence is seen in the american style of laughter love of noisy 
sociality looseness of movement da ncing and music it is noted that  certain very primitive peoples 
believe that it is not possible to  usurp territory since the childre n bom there would inherit the wrong 
ancestral spirits parallels are drawn between the east s influence on ancient rome and the influence of 
the indian on america the anatomical differences  between americans and europeans particularly 
noticeable in the shift from the europ ean facial structure towards that of  the indian are c ited as concrete 
examples of this phenomenon as a resu lt of  years work with americ an patients it is concluded that 
the guiding principle of the american spirit is the hero ic ideal an attitude t ypically characteristic of a 
sporty primitive society it is in this heroic attitude that the influence of the historical indian spirit is 
considered to be most apparent the maxim that the conqueror overcomes the body but succumbs to the 
spirits is applied to america alt hough no conclusions are drawn about the value of these influences it is 
simply pointed out as an interesting fact that am erica has the most complicated psychology of all the 
nations  
  the dreamlike world of india  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  nd ed 
princeton university press   p p   
impressions of india formed during the course of a si x week tour are recorded india is seen to possess a 
certain immutable core upon which all other events whether they i nvolve an individual life or the 
culture of a conquering civilization unfold as if on f ilm indian life is unimagi nably rich in color and 
detail but it seems essentially transi tory dreamlike like a multicolored veil of maya it is observed that 
in india one feels the presence of gr eat age but recognizes tittle histor y history is seen as meaningless 
in india for everything that exists there has exis ted a thousand times before  even the unique gautama 
buddha who is but one of a succe ssion of many buddhas the west is likened to a directional vector 
india to that same vector extended infinitely until it  returns to its origin the differences between the 
moslem and the hindu temperament are noted as expressed even in thei r respective modes of dress the 
one is active warlike and the other passive s ubmissive the impression of softness that the hindu 
displays indicates a predominance of the feminine el ement in the family family life and the relationship 
between the sexes in india are compared to their e xpression in the west and found to be superior in 
several regards it is concluded that the indian s have found a degree of dom estic belonging that we 
cannot attain  
 what india can teach us  in jun g c collected works of c g jun g vol  nd ed 
princeton university press   p p   
the indian mode of thought is compared to that of the west and found to be superior in certain respects 
indians are observed not to think as western man thinks but rather to perceive their thoughts this 
mode of cognition is seen as similar to the prim itive thought process and a natural deve opment in a 
civilization that has existed unbr oken from primitive times in th e west however primitive man was 
confronted by an invasion of a psychology and spirit uality that belonged to a much higher level of 
civilization this invasion is seen to result in  the fragmentation of western mans psyche into a 
hyperdeveloped conscious mind and a suppressed primitive unconscious it is felt that western man 
needs to realize this unconscious darkness if he is to survive india on the other hand is an example of a 
civilization that brought every esse ntial trace of primitivit y with it indias civilization and psychology 
are symbolized in the carvings that decorate her temp les with graphic depictions  of man at his best and 
worst it seems dreamlike to the western observer pr ecisely because its daily lif e gives expression to the 
unconscious world that we deny i ndia is seen to represent the ot her way of civilizing man without 
suppression violence or rationalism the indian way of thinking typically results in an increase of 
vision as oppossed to the wests tendency to scrutini ze the details of nature which results in the 
formulation of isolated fa cts it is concluded that the indian is capable of transforming his gods into 
thoughts since the concept of god is  ultimately based on instinctual thought patterns thus the indian 
unlike western man has been able to re scue his gods and live with them  
  editorial remarks on psychotherapy  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol 
 nd ed princeton university press   p p   
 general remarks on the course of psychotherapy are made in an addres s to the general medical society 
for psychotherapy it is noted that psychotherapy like current politics  is marked by a confusion of 
conflicting doctrines onesided and mutually exclus ive methods of observation are deplored and an 
impartial appreciation of all objective  contributions to psychotherapy is  urged as the ideal it is hoped 
that future theorists will go beyond the grounds of the pathological and the personal in constructing 
theories that will do justice to the whole psyche  
  a rejoinder to dr bally def ense of political position  in jung c collected works of c

 a rejoinder to dr bally has the twin purposes of  explaining how jungs name became attached to a 
nazi political manifesto and to rebut the charge of antisemitism which followed the manifestos 
circulation the manifesto was inte nded to appear in a special edition of the zentralblatt fur 
psychotherapie the journal of the international so ciety for psychotherapy which was to be circulated 
only in germany it consisted of a loyalty oath to  the german government and a pledge to practice 
germanic psychotherapy on the part of the germ an section of the society these promises were 
demanded of the german section unde r threat of disbandment agains t jungs wishes the article was 
printed in the regular edition of th e zentralbiatt and as acting president of the society jungs name 
appeared above it it is remarked that while it is easy to ridicule germanic psychotherapy it is quite 
anothermatter entirely to deal with the demands of politics in an attempt to save medicine for the sake 
of humanity it is not the role of doctors to oppose na tional socialism as if it were a political party but 
rather to heal the sick even if they are the enemy the jewish question is raised in jungs early work but 
such discussions on sensitive subjects are defe nded as the province of the psychotherapist all 
psychological theories should be examined for their s ubjective premises as thes e are identical with the 
individuals psychic idiosyncrasy which is conditi oned by the family nation race locality and history 
it is to be expected that the et hnic background of the individual theorist will color his theories this 
natural bias is said to be the basi s of jungian criticism of freuds a nd adlers theories for their jewish 
prejudice it is pointed out that this question was first discussed in  and that it is onl y now bein g 
exploited for political ends

 a circular letter is reproduced in which all psychothe rapists regardless of creed are invited to join the 
international general medical society for psychotherapy it  is pointed out that the society is divided into 
national groups but that membership in the society is not contingent upon affi liation with a national 
group  
  editorial psychotherapy and philosophy in jung c  collected works of c g jung vol 
 nd ed princeton iyniversity press   p p   
 the accusation that modem psychotherapy is too c oncerned with philosophical problems and too little 
with the minutiae of case histories is rebutted it is  maintained that therapy consists of helping the 
individual to adapt to both his in terior and exterior situation and th erefore must take into account the 
political economic philosophical a nd religious forces of the day psychotherapy cannot artificially 
separate its proper subject  the si ck psyche  from its wider back ground the human psyche in general 
as a result of this numerous theori es concerning the nature of the psyc he have sprung up as adjuncts to 
psychotherapy the premises of these theories must in turn be critically examined in order to determine 
if they have been tainted by the subjective prejudices  of the theoretician it is pointed out that all 
sciences must criticize their assumptions critical discussion of general assu mptions is held to be 
particularly important for the present phase of psychot herapy since it brings to  light assumptions that 
exist tacitly and are therefore all the more dangerous  
  editorial note internation al aspects of psychology  in jung c collected works of c g

 the inclusion of three articles by nonswiss authors in  the swiss issue of the zentralblatt is lauded as 
symbolizing the swiss cultural charact eristic of promoting international collaboration it is noted that the 
greatest danger that threatens psychology is the one sidedness of a single viewpoint and that these 
articles contribute to the enrichment of the swiss out look by contrasting it with  those of other nations  
  presidential address to the th general medical cong ress for psychotherapy bad 
nauheim   in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  nd ed princeton university 
press   p p   
 two difficulties that have reta rded the growth of the internati onal medical society for psychotherapy 
are discussed the first problem is that psyc hotherapy is a young science and has not yet gotten 
completely out of the shadow cast by its two older si sters psychiatry and ne urology as a rule it has 
existed only marginally under their auspices it is maintained however that psychotherapy has 
advanced to the stage where its correct implementa tion requires a specialist a nd not a psychiatrist or 
neurologist the second difficulty re sults from the doctrinairian approa ch to theory observed in some 
psychotherapists who hold their theories to be indisput able with a conviction that is likened to religious 
faith this opinion makes objective discussion am ong professionals deemed  necessary for the 
advancement of any science impossible it is conc luded that in the face of these difficulties the 
intemational society must maintain psychotherapy as  an independent branch of medicine and that 
scientific truths cannot be  substantiated by uncritical and onesided convictions

 the reasons for jungs acceptance of the presidency  of the international society the difficulties 
involved with that post and views on the future of  psychotherapy are presented it is stated that 
presidency was accepted in order to bolster the posit ion of psychotherapy in germany and to help it 
maintain its international contacts  it is observed that from the fi rst opponents of the society have 
attempted to render impossible objective discussion  considered the goal and pur pose of the society  
by sowing seeds of political suspicion and sectar ian discord having overcome these problems the 
society is now seen to be strong enough to assume its social responsibilitie s it is warned that 
psychological problems are more deeply rooted in the public than is generally acknowledged 
psychotherapists are urged to accept lay assistants as medical doctors have done in order to multiply 
their own effectiveness

 the importance of cultivating a viewpoint that allo ws the psychotherapist to free himself from the

every professional opinion will be allowed expression and that as ma ny nations as possible will make 
their contribution to the total pi cture of the european psyche  
  presidential address to the th intern ational medical congress for psychotherapy 
oxford   in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  nd ed princeton university 
press   p p   
 the chief obstacle to collaboration in the field of ps ychotherapy is seen to be the doctrinairian disputes 
over theory which have divided psychologists into  sectarian schools since the greater part of 
psychotherapy is not dependent on a particular theore tical base for its implementation it is suggested 
that these warring schools stop debating the essence of the psyche and attempt to seek common ground 
in the areas of psychotherapeutic technique the sw iss committee of psychotherapy which was able to 
unite the various factions to aggr eement is advanced as a model for how to go about reaching a working 
harmony in psychology
