general description of the types  
a introduction  
in the following pages i shall attempt a general description of the types and my first concern 
must be with the two general types i have termed introverted and extraverted but in addition i 
shall also try to give a certain characterizati on of those special types whose particularity is due to 
the fact that his most differentiated function plays the principal role in an individuals adaptation 
or orientation to life the former i would term general attitude types since they are distinguish ed 
by the direction of general interest or libido movement while the latter i would call  function 
types   
the general attitude types as i have pointed out more than once are differentiated by their 
particular attitude to the object the introverts atti tude to the object is an abstracting one at 
bottom he is always facing the problem of how libido can be withdrawn from the object as 
though an attempted ascendancy on the part of the object had to be continually frustrated the 
extravert on the contra ry maintains a positive relation to the object to such an extent does he 
affirm its importance that his subjective attitude is continually being orientated by and related to 
the object an fond the object can never have sufficient value for him there fore its importance 
must always be paramount  
the two types are so essentially different presenting so striking a contrast that their existence 
even to the p  uninitiated in psychological matters becomes an obvious fact when once 
attention has been drawn to it who does not know those taciturn impenetrable often shy 
natures who form such a vivid contrast to these other open sociable serene maybe or at least 
friendly and accessible characters who are on good terms with all the world or e ven when 
disagreeing with it still hold a relation to it by which they and it are mutually affected  
naturally at first one is inclined to regard such differences as mere individual idiosyncrasies 
but anyone with the opportunity of gaining a fundament al knowledge of many men will soon 
discover that such a far reaching contrast does not merely concern the individual case but is a 
question of typical attitudes with a universality far greater than a limited psychological 
experience would at first assume  in reality as the preceding chapters will have shown it is a 
question of a fundamental opposition at times clear and at times obscure but always emerging 
whenever we are dealing with individuals whose personality is in any way pronounced such 
men ar e found not only among the educated classes but in every rank of society with equal 
distinctness therefore our types can be demonstrated among labourers and peasants as among

the most differentiated members of a nation furthermore these types over ride the distinctions 
of sex since one finds the same contrasts amongst women of all classes such a universal 
distribution could hardly arise at the instigation of consciousness ie as the result of a conscious 
and deliberate choice of attitude if this w ere the case a definite level of society linked together 
by a similar education and environment and therefore correspondingly localized would surely 
have a majority representation of such an attitude but the actual facts are just the reverse for the  
types have apparently quite a random distribution p  in the same family one child is 
introverted and another extraverted  
since in the light of these facts the attitude type regarded as a general phenomenon having an 
apparent random distribut ion can be no affair of conscious judgment or intention its existence 
must be due to some unconscious instinctive cause the contrast of types therefore as a 
universal psychological phenomenon must in some way or other have its biological precursor   
the relation between subject and object considered biologically is always a relation of 
adaptation since every relation between subject and object presupposes mutually modifying 
effects from either side these modifications constitute the adaptation the typical attitudes to 
the object therefore are adaptation processes nature knows two fundamentally different ways 
of adaptation which determine the further existence of the living organism the one is by 
increased fertility accompanied by a relative ly small degree of defensive power and individual 
conservation the other is by individual equipment of manifold means of self protection coupled 
with a relatively insignificant fertility this biological contrast seems not merely to be the 
analogue but also the general foundation of our two psychological modes of adaptation at this 
point a mere general indication must suffice on the one hand i need only point to the peculiarity 
of the extravert which constantly urges him to spend and propagate himsel f in every way and 
on the other to the tendency of the introvert to defend himself against external claims to 
conserve himself from any expenditure of energy directly related to the object thus consolidating 
for himself the most secure and impregnable  position  
blakes intuition did not err when he described the two forms as the prolific and the 
devouring   as is p  shown by the general biological example both forms are current 
and successful after their kind  this is equally true of the typical attitudes what the one brings 
about by a multiplicity of relations the other gains by monopoly  
the fact that often in their earliest years children display an unmistakable ty pical attitude forces 
us to assume that it cannot possibly be the struggle for existence as it is generally understood 
which constitutes the compelling factor in favour of a definite attitude we might however 
demur and indeed with cogency that even the tiny infant the very babe at the breast has 
already an unconscious psychological adaptation to perform inasmuch as the special character of 
the maternal influence leads to specific reactions in the child this argument though appealing to 
incontest able facts has none the less to yield before the equally unarguable fact that two children 
of the same mother may at a very early age exhibit opposite types without the smallest 
accompanying change in the attitude of the mother although nothing would in duce me to 
underestimate the well nigh incalculable importance of parental influence this experience 
compels me to conclude that the decisive factor must be looked for in the disposition of the child 
the fact that in spite of the greatest possible simil arity of external conditions one child will

assume this type while another that must of course in the last resort he ascribed to individual 
disposition naturally in saying this i only refer to those cases which occur under normal 
conditions under abn ormal conditions ie when there is an extreme and therefore abnormal 
attitude in the mother the children can also be coerced into a relatively similar attitude but this 
entails a violation of their individual disposition which quite possibly would h ave assumed 
another type if no abnormal and disturbing external influence had intervened as a rule 
whenever such a falsification of type takes place as a result of external p  influence the 
individual becomes neurotic later and a cur can successf ully be sought only in a development of 
that attitude which corresponds with the individuals natural way  
as regards the particular disposition i know not what to say except that there are clearly 
individuals who have either a greater readiness and cap acity for one way or for whom it is more 
congenial to adapt to that way rather than the other in the last analysis it may well be that 
physiological causes inaccessible to our knowledge play a part in this that this may be the case 
seems to me not imp robable in view of ones experience that a reversal of type often proves 
exceedingly harmful to the physiological well being of the organism often provoking an acute 
state of exhaustion  
b the extraverted type  
in our descriptions of this and the follow ing type it will be necessary in the interest of lucid and 
comprehensive presentation to discriminate between the conscious and unconscious psychology 
let us first lend our minds to a description of the  phenomena of consciousness   
the general attitu de of consciousness  
everyone is admittedly orientated by the data with which the outer world provides him  yet we 
see that this may be the case in a way that is only relatively decisive because it is cold out of 
doors one man is persuaded to wear his overcoat another from a desire to become hardened 
finds this unnecessary one man admires the new tenor because all the world admires him 
another withholds his approbation not because he dislikes him but because in his view the 
subject of general admirat ion is not thereby proved to be admirable one submits to p  a 
given state of affairs because his experience argues nothing else to be possible another is 
convinced that although it has repeated itself a thousand times in the same way the thousand  
and first will be different the former is orientated by the objective data the latter reserves a 
view which is as it were interposed between himself and the objective fact now when the 
orientation to the object and to objective facts is so predomin ant that the most frequent and 
essential decisions and actions are determined not by subjective values but by objective 
relations one speaks of an extraverted attitude when this is habitual one speaks of an 
extraverted type if a man so thinks feels and acts in a word so lives as to correspond directly 
with objective conditions and their claims whether in a good sense or ill he is extraverted his 
life makes it perfectly clear that it is the objective rather than the subjective value which plays 
the greater role as the determining factor of his consciousness he naturally has subjective 
values but their determining power has less importance than the external objective conditions 
never therefore does he expect to find any absolute factors in his  own inner life since the only 
ones he knows are outside himself epimetheus like his inner life succumbs to the external

necessity not of course without a struggle which however always ends in favour of the 
objective determinant his entire consciou sness looks outwards to the world because the 
important and decisive determination always comes to him from without but it comes to him 
from without only because that is where he expects it all the distinguishing characteristics of 
his psychology in s o far as they do not arise from the priority of one definite psychological 
function or from individual peculiarities have their origin in this basic attitude interest and 
attention follow objective happenings and primarily those of the immediate enviro nment not 
p  only persons but things seize and rivet his interest his actions therefore are also 
governed by the influence of persons and things they are directly related to objective data and 
determinations and are as it were exhaustively explainable on these grounds extraverted action 
is recognizably related to objective conditions in so far it is not purely reactive to environmental 
stimuli it character is constantly applicable to the actual circumstances and it finds adequate and 
appropriate play within the limits of the objective situation it has no serious tendency to 
transcend these bounds the same holdsgood for interest objective occurrences have a well nigh 
inexhaustible charm so that in the normal course the extraverts inte rest makes no other claims  
the moral laws which govern his action coincide with the corresponding claims of society ie 
with the generally valid moral view point if the generally valid view were different the 
subjective moral guiding line would also be different without the general psychological habitus 
being in any way changed it might almost seem although it is by no means the case that this 
rigid determination by objective factors would involve an altogether ideal and complete 
adaptation to ge neral conditions of life an accommodation to objective data such as we have 
described must of course seem a complete adaptation to the extraverted view since from this 
standpoint no other criterion exists but from a higher point of view it is by no  means granted 
that the standpoint of objectively given facts is the normal one under all circumstances 
objective conditions may be either temporarily or locally abnormal an individual who is 
accommodated to such con certainly conforms to the abnormal s tyle of his surroundings but in 
relation to the universally valid laws of life he is in common with his milieu in an abnormal 
position the individual may however thrive in such surroundings p  but only to the point 
when he together with his whole milieu is destroyed for transgressing the universal laws of life 
he must inevitably participate in this downfall with the same completeness as he was previously 
adjusted to the objectively valid situation he is adjusted but not adapted since ada ptation 
demands more than a mere frictionless participation in the momentary conditions of the 
immediate environment once more i would point to spittelers epimetheus adaptation 
demands an observance of laws far more universal in their application than  purely local and 
temporary conditions mere adjustment is the limitation of the normal extraverted type on the 
one hand the extravert owes his normality to his ability to fit into existing conditions with 
relative ease he naturally pretends to nothing more than the satisfaction of existing objective 
possibilities applying himself for instance to the calling which offers sound prospective 
possibilities in the actual situation in time and place he tries to do or to make just what his 
milieu momentaril y needs and expects from him and abstains from every innovation that is not 
entirely obvious or that in any way exceeds the expectation of those around him but on the 
other hand his normality must also depend essentially upon whether the extravert take s into 
account the actuality of his subjective needs and requirements and this is just his weak point for 
the tendency of his type has such a strong outward direction that even the most obvious of all 
subjective facts namely the condition of his own bod y may quite easily receive inadequate 
psychological types

consideration the body is not sufficiently objective or external so that the satisfaction of 
simple elementary requirements which are indispensable to physical well being are no longer 
given their place the body accordingly suffers to say nothing of the soul although as a rule 
the extravert takes small note of p  this latter circumstance his intimate domestic circle 
perceives it all the more keenly his loss of equilibrium is perceived by himself only w hen 
abnormal bodily sensations make themselves felt  
these tangible facts he cannot ignore it is natural he should regard them as concrete and 
objective since for his mentality there exists only this and nothing more  in himself in others 
he at onc e sees imagination at work a too extraverted attitude may actually become so 
regardless of the subject that the latter is entirely sacrificed to so called objective claims to the 
demands for instance of a continually extending business because order s lie claiming ones 
attention or because profitable possibilities are constantly being opened up which must instantly 
be seized  
this is the extraverts danger he becomes caught up in objects wholly losing himself in their 
toils the functional nervou s or actual physical disorders which result from this state have a 
compensatory significance forcing the subject to an involuntary self restriction should the 
symptoms be functional their peculiar formation may symbolically express the psychological 
situation a singer for instance whose fame quickly reaches a dangerous pitch tempting him to a 
disproportionate outlay of energy is suddenly robbed of his high tones by a nervous inhibition 
a man of very modest beginnings rapidly reaches a social positi on of great influence and wide 
prospects when suddenly he is overtaken by a psychogenic state with all the symptoms of 
mountain sickness again a man on the point of marrying an idolized woman of doubtful 
character whose value he extravagantly over estimates is seized with a spasm of the 
oesophagus which forces him to a regimen of two cups of milk in the day demanding his three 
hourly attention all visits to his fiance are thus effectually stopped and no choice is left to him 
p  but to busy himself with his bodily nourishment a man who through his own energy 
and enterprise has built up a vast business entailing an intolerable burden of work is afflicted by 
nervous attacks of thirst as a result of which he speedily falls a victim to hyster ical alcoholism  
hysteria is in my view by far the most frequent neurosis with the extraverted type the classical 
example of hysteria is always characterized by an exaggerated rapport with the members of his 
circle and a frankly imitatory accommodatio n to surrounding conditions a constant tendency to 
appeal for interest and to produce impressions upon his milieu is a basic trait of the hysterical 
nature a correlate to this is his proverbial suggestibility his pliability to another persons 
influence  unmistakable extraversion comes out in the communicativeness of the hysteric which 
occasionally leads to the divulging of purely phantastic contents whence arises the reproach of 
the hysterical lie  
to begin with the hysterical character is an exag geration of the normal attitude it is then 
complicated by compensatory reactions from the side of the unconscious which manifests its 
opposition to the extravagant extraversion in the form of physical disorders whereupon an 
introversion of psychic energ y becomes unavoidable through this reaction of the unconscious 
another category of symptoms arises which have a more introverted character a morbid 
intensification of phantasy activity belongs primarily to this category from this general

characterizati on of the extraverted attitude let us now turn to a description of the modifications 
which the basic psychological functions undergo as a result of this attitude p   
ii the attitude of the unconscious  
it may perhaps seem odd that i should speak of attitude of the unconscious as i have already 
sufficiently indicated i regard the relation of the unconscious to the conscious as compensatory 
the unconscious according to this view has as good a claim to an i attitude as the conscious  
in the foregoing section i emphasized the tendency to a certain one sidedness in the extraverted 
attitude due to the controlling power of the objective factor in the course of psychic events the 
extraverted type is constantly tempted to give himself away appa rently in favour of the object 
and to assimilate his subject to the object   i have referred in detail to the ultimate consequences 
of this exaggeration of the extraverted attitude viz to the injurious suppression of the subjective 
factor it is only to be expected therefore that a psychic compensation of the conscious 
extraverted attitude will lay especial weight upon the subjective factor ie we shall have to 
prove a strong egocentric tendency in the unconscious practical experience actually fur nishes 
this proof i do not wish to enter into a casuistical survey at this point so must refer my readers 
to the ensuing sections where i shall attempt to present the characteristic attitude of the 
unconscious from the angle of each function type in th is section we are merely concerned with 
the compensation of a general extraverted attitude i shall therefore confine myself to an equally 
general characterization of the compensating attitude of the unconscious  
the attitude of the unconscious as an ef fective complement to the conscious extraverted attitude 
has a definitely introverting character it focusses libido upon the subjective factor ie all those 
needs and claims which are stifled or repressed by a too extraverted conscious p  attitude  
it may be readily gathered from what has been said in the previous section that a purely objective 
orientation does violence to a multitude of subjective emotions intentions needs and desires 
since it robs them of the energy which is their natural ri ght man is not a machine that one can 
reconstruct as occasion demands upon other lines and for quite other ends in the hope that it 
will then proceed to function in a totally different way just as normally as before man bears his 
agelong history wi th him   in his very structure is written the history of mankind  
the historical factor represents a vital need to which a wise economy must respond somehow 
the past must become vocal and participate in the present complete assimilation to the object 
therefore encounters the protest of the suppressed minority elements belonging to the past and 
existing from the beginning from this quite general consideration it may be understood why it is 
that the unconscious claims of the extraverted type have an e ssentially primitive infantile and 
egoistical character when freud says that the unconscious is only able to wish this 
observation contains a large measure of truth for the unconscious of the extraverted type 
adjustment and assimilation to objective  data prevent inadequate subjective impulses from 
reaching consciousness these tendencies thoughts wishes affects needs feelings etc take on 
a regressive character corresponding with the degree of their repression ie the less they are 
recognized  the more infantile and archaic they become the conscious attitude robs them of 
their relatively disposable energycharge only leaving them the energy of which it cannot deprive 
them this remainder which still possesses a potency not to be under estima ted can be

described only as primeval instinct instinct can never be rooted out from an individual by any 
arbitrary measures it requires p  the slow organic transformation of many generations to 
effect a radical change for instinct is the energi c sic expression of a definite organic 
foundation  
thus with every repressed tendency a considerable sum of energy ultimately remains this sum 
corresponds with the potency of the instinct and guards its effectiveness notwithstanding the 
deprivation of  energy which made it unconscious the measure of extraversion in the conscious 
attitude entails a like degree of infantilism and archaism in the attitude of the unconscious the 
egoism which so often characterizes the extraverts unconscious attitude goes  far beyond mere 
childish selfishness it even verges upon the wicked and brutal it is here we find in fullest bloom 
that incest wish described by freud it is self evident that these things are entirely unconscious 
remaining altogether hidden from the e yes of the uninitiated observer so long as the extraversion 
of the conscious attitude does not reach an extreme stage but wherever an exaggeration of the 
conscious standpoint takes place the unconscious also comes to light in a symptomatic form ie 
the unconscious egoism infantilism and archaism lose their original compensatory characters 
and appear in more or less open opposition to the conscious attitude this process begins in the 
form of an absurd exaggeration of the conscious standpoint which i s aimed at a further 
repression of the unconscious but usually ends in a reductio ad absurdum of the conscious 
attitude ie a collapse the catastrophe may be an objective one since the objective aims 
gradually become falsified by the subjective i rem ember the case of a printer who starting as a 
mere employ worked his way up through two decades of hard struggle till at last he was the 
independent possessor of a very extensive business the more the business extended the more it 
increased its hold upon him until gradually every other interest p  was allowed to become 
merged in it at length he was completely enmeshed in its toils and as we shall soon see this 
surrender eventually proved his ruin as a sort of compensation to his exclusive interest in the 
business certain memories of his childhood came to life as a child he had taken great delight in 
painting and drawing but instead of renewing this capacity for its own sake as a balancing side 
interest he canalized it into his business  and began to conceive artistic elaborations of his 
products his phantasies unfortunately materialized he actually began to produce after his own 
primitive and infantile taste with the result that after a very few years his business went to 
pieces he  acted in obedience to one of our civilized ideals which enjoins the energetic man to 
concentrate everything upon the one end in view but he went too far and merely fell a victim to 
the power of his subjective infantile claims  
but the catastrophic s olution may also be subjective ie in the form of a nervous collapse such 
a solution always comes about as a result of the unconscious counterinfluence which can 
ultimately paralyse conscious action in which case the claims of the unconscious force 
themselves categorically upon consciousness thus creating a calamitous cleavage which 
generally reveals itself in two ways either the subject no longer knows what he really wants and 
nothing any longer interests him or he wants too much at once and has to o keen an interest but 
in impossible things the suppression of infantile and primitive claims which is often necessary 
on civilized grounds easily leads to neurosis or to the misuse of narcotics such as alcohol 
morphine cocaine etc in more extrem e cases the cleavage ends in suicide

it is a salient peculiarity of unconscious tendencies that just in so far as they are deprived of 
their energy by a lack of conscious recognition they assume a correspond  p  ingly 
destructive character and a s soon as this happen their compensatory function ceases they cease 
to have a compensatory effect as soon as they reach a depth or stratum that corresponds with a 
level of culture absolutely incompatible with our own from this moment the unconscious 
tendencies form a block which is opposed to the conscious attitude in every respect  such a bloc 
inevitably leads to open conflict  
in a general way the compensating attitude of the unconscious finds expression in the process of 
psychic equilibrium a norm al extraverted attitude does not of course mean that the individual 
behaves invariably in accordance with the extraverted schema even in the same individual many 
psychological happenings may be observed in which the mechanism of introversion is 
concern ed a habitus can be called extraverted only when the mechanism of extraversion 
predominates in such a case the most highly differentiated function has a constantly extraverted 
application while the inferior functions are found in the service of introver sion ie the more 
valued function because the more conscious is more completely subordinated to conscious 
control and purpose whilst the less conscious in other words the partly unconscious inferior 
functions are subjected to conscious free choice i n a much smaller degree  
the superior function is always the expression of the conscious personality its aim its will and 
its achievement whilst the inferior functions belong to the things that happen to one not that 
they merely beget blunders eg lapsus linguae or lapsus calami but they may also breed half or 
threequarter resolves since the inferior functions also possess a slight degree of consciousness 
the extraverted feeling type is a classical example of this for he enjoys an excellent fee ling 
rapport with his entourage yet occasionally opinions of an incomparable tactlessness p  
will just happen to him these opinions have their source in his inferior and subconscious 
thinking which is only partly subject to control and is insuffic iently related to the object  to a 
large extent therefore it can operate without consideration or responsibility  
in the extraverted attitude the inferior functions always reveal a highly subjective determination 
with pronounced egocentricity and perso nal bias thus demonstrating their close connection with 
the unconscious through their agency the unconscious is continually coming to light on no 
account should we imagine that the unconscious lies permanently buried under so many 
overlying strata that it can only be uncovered so to speak by a laborious process of excavation 
on the contrary there is a constant influx of the unconscious into the conscious psychological 
process at times this reaches such a pitch that the observer can decide only with difficulty which 
character traits are to be ascribed to the conscious and which to the unconscious personality 
this difficulty occurs mainly with persons whose habit of expression errs rather on the side of 
profuseness naturally it depends very largely also upon the attitude of the observer whether he 
lays hold of the conscious or the unconscious character of a personality speaking generally a 
judging observer will tend to seize the conscious character while a perceptive observer will be 
influenced mo re by the unconscious character since judgement is chiefly interested in the 
conscious motivation of the psychic process while perception tends to register the mere 
happening but in so far as we apply perception and judgment in equal measure it may eas ily 
happen that a personality appears to us as both introverted and extraverted so that we cannot at 
once decide to which attitude the superior function belongs in such cases only a thorough

analysis of the function qualities can help us to a sound opini on during the analysis we must 
observe which p  function is placed under the control and motivation of consciousness and 
which functions have an accidental and spontaneous character the former is always more highly 
differentiated than the latter which also possess many infantile and primitive qualities 
occasionally the former function gives the impression of normality while the latter have 
something abnormal or pathological about them  
iii the peculiarities of the basic psychological function s in the 
extraverted attitude   
 thinking  
as a result of the general attitude of extraversion thinking is orientated by the object and 
objective data this orientation of thinking produces a noticeable peculiarity  
thinking in general is fed from two so urces firstly from subjective and in the last resort 
unconscious roots and secondly from objective data transmitted through sense perceptions  
extraverted thinking is conditioned in a larger measure by these latter factors than by the former 
judgment a lways presupposes a criterion  for the extraverted judgment the valid and 
determining criterion is the standard taken from objective conditions no matter whether this be 
directly represented by an objectively perceptible fact or expressed in an objecti ve idea  for an 
objective idea even when subjectively sanctioned is equally external and objective in origin 
extraverted thinking therefore need not necessarily be a merely concretistic thinking it may 
equally well be a purely ideal thinking if for  instance it can be shown that the ideas with which 
it is engaged are to a great extent borrowed from without ie are transmitted by tradition and 
education the criterion of judgment therefore as to whether or no a thinking is extraverted 
hangs dire ctly upon the question by p  which standard is its judgment governed  is it 
furnished from without or is its origin subjective a further criterion is afforded by the direction 
of the thinkers conclusion namely whether or no the thinking has a  preferential direction 
outwards it is no proof of its extraverted nature that it is preoccupied with concrete objects 
since i may be engaging my thoughts with a concrete object either because i am abstracting my 
thought from it or because i am concreti zing my thought with it even if i engage my thinking 
with concrete things and to that extent could be described as extraverted it yet remains both 
questionable and characteristic as regards the direction my thinking will take namely whether in 
its fur ther course it leads back again to objective data external facts and generally accepted 
ideas or not so far as the practical thinking of the merchant the engineer or the natural science 
pioneer is concerned the objective direction is at once manifes t but in the case of a philosopher 
it is open to doubt whenever the course of his thinking is directed towards ideas in such a case 
before deciding we must further enquire whether these ideas are mere abstractions from 
objective experience in which c ase they would merely represent higher collective concepts 
comprising a sum of objective facts  or whether if they are clearly not abstractions from 
immediate experience they may not be derived from tradition or borrowed from the intellectual 
atmospher e of the time in the latter event such ideas must also belong to the category of 
objective data in which case this thinking should also be called extraverted

although i do not propose to present the nature of introverted thinking at this point reserv ing it 
for a later section it is however essential that i should make a few statements about it before 
going further for if one considers strictly what i have just said concerning p  extraverted 
thinking one might easily conclude that such a sta tement includes everything that is generally 
understood as thinking it might indeed be argued that a thinking whose aim is concerned neither 
with objective facts nor with general ideas scarcely merits the name thinking i am fully aware 
of the fact that  the thought of our age in common with its most eminent representatives knows 
and acknowledges only the extraverted type of thinking this is partly due to the fact that all 
thinking which attains visible form upon the worlds surface whether as science  philosophy or 
even art either proceeds direct from objects or flows into general ideas on either ground 
although not always completely evident it at least appears essentially intelligible and therefore 
relatively valid in this sense it might be sai d that the extraverted intellect ie the mind that is 
orientated by objective data is actually the only one recognized  
there is also however  and now i come to the question of the introverted intellect  an entirely 
different kind of thinking to which the term i thinking can hardly be denied it is a kind that is 
neither orientated by the immediate objective experience nor is it concerned with general and 
objectively derived ideas i reach this other kind of thinking in the following way when m y 
thoughts are engaged with a concrete object or general idea in such a way that the course of my 
thinking eventually leads me back again to my object this intellectual process is not the only 
psychic proceeding taking place in me at the moment i will di sregard all those possible 
sensations and feelings which become noticeable as a more or less disturbing accompaniment to 
my train of thought merely emphasizing the fact that this very thinking process which proceeds 
from objective data and strives again t owards the object stands also in a constant relation to the 
subject this relation is a condition sine qua non without which no think  p  ing process 
whatsoever could take place even though my thinking process is directed as far as possible 
towar ds objective data nevertheless it is my subjective process and it can neither escape the 
subjective admixture nor yet dispense with it although i try my utmost to give a completely 
objective direction to my train of thought even then i cannot exclude t he parallel subjective 
process with its all embracing participation without extinguishing the very spark of life from my 
thought this parallel subjective process has a natural tendency only relatively avoidable to 
subjectify objective facts ie to assimilate them to the subject  
whenever the chief value is given to the subjective process that other kind of thinking arises 
which stands opposed to extraverted thinking namely that purely subjective orientation of 
thought which i have termed introvert ed a thinking arises from this other orientation that is 
neither determined by objective facts nor directed towards objective data  a thinking therefore 
that proceeds from subjective data and is directed towards subjective ideas or facts of a 
subjecti ve character i do not wish to enter more fully into this kind of thinking here i have 
merely established its existence for the purpose of giving a necessary complement to the 
extraverted thinking process whose nature is thus brought to a clearer focus  
when the objective orientation receives a certain predominance the thinking is extraverted this 
circumstance changes nothing as regards the logic of thought  it merely determines that 
difference between thinkers which james regards as a matter of temp erament the orientation 
towards the object as already explained makes no essential change in the thinking function

only its appearance is altered since it is governed by objective data it has the appearance of 
being captivated by the object as thoug h without the external orientation it simply could not p 
 exist almost it seems as though it were a sequence of external facts or as though it could 
reach its highest point only when chiming in with some generally valid idea it seems constantly 
to be affected by objective data drawing only those conclusions which substantially agree with 
these thus it gives one the impression of a certain lack of freedom of occasional short 
sightedness in spite of every kind of adroitness within the objectively  circumscribed area what 
i am now describing is merely the impression this sort of thinking makes upon the observer who 
must himself already have a different standpoint or it would be quite impossible for him to 
observe the phenomenon of extraverted thi nking as a result of his different standpoint he 
merely sees its aspect not its nature whereas the man who himself possesses this type of 
thinking is able to seize its nature while its aspect escapes him judgment made upon appearance 
only cannot be fa ir to the essence of the thing hence the result is depreciatory but essentially 
this thinking is no less fruitful and creative than introverted thinking only its powers are in the 
service of other ends this difference is perceived most clearly when extr averted thinking is 
engaged upon material which is specifically an object of the subjectively orientated thinking 
this happens for instance when a subjective conviction is interpreted analytically from 
objective facts or is regarded as a product or der ivative of objective ideas but for our 
scientifically orientated consciousness the difference between the two modes of thinking 
becomes still more obvious when the subjectively orientated thinking makes an attempt to bring 
objective data into connecti ons not objectively given ie to subordinate them to a subjective 
idea either senses the other as an encroachment and hence a sort of shadow effect is produced 
wherein either type reveals to the other its least favourable aspect the subjectively orie ntated 
thinking then appears p  quite arbitrary while the extraverted thinking seems to have an 
incommensurability that is altogether dull and banal thus the two standpoints are incessantly at 
war  
such a conflict we might think could be easily adjusted if only we clearly discriminated objects 
of a subjective from those of an objective nature unfortunately however such a discrimination 
is a matter of impossibility although not a few have attempted it even if such a separation were 
possible it would be a very disastrous proceeding since in themselves both orientations are one 
sided with a definitely restricted validity hence they both require this mutual correction 
thought is at once sterilized whenever thinking is brought to any great extent under the 
influence of objective data since it becomes degraded into a mere appendage of objective facts 
in which case it is no longer able to free itself from objective data for the purpose of establishing 
an abstract idea the process of thoug ht is reduced to mere reflection not in the sense of 
meditation but in the sense of a mere imitation that makes no essential affirmation beyond what 
was already visibly and immediately present in the objective data such a thinking process leads 
naturally and directly back to the objective fact but never beyond it  not once therefore can it 
lead to the coupling of experience with an objective idea and vice versa when this thinking has 
an objective idea for its object it is quite unable to gras p the practical individual experience but 
persists in a more or less tautological position the materialistic mentality presents a magnificent 
example of this  
when as the result of a reinforced objective determination extraverted thinking is subordina ted 
to objective data it entirely loses itself on the one hand in the individual experience and

proceeds to amass an accumulation of undigested empirical material the oppressive mass of 
more or less disconnected individual experiences p  produce s a state of intellectual 
dissociation which on the other hand usually demands a psychological compensation this 
must consist in an idea just as simple as it is universal which shall give coherence to the 
heaped up but intrinsically disconnected whol e or at least it should provide an inkling of such a 
connection such ideas as matter or energy are suitable for this purpose but whenever 
thinking primarily depends not so much upon external facts as upon an accepted or second hand 
idea the very p overty of the idea provokes a compensation in the form of a still more impressive 
accumulation of facts which assume a one sided grouping in keeping with the relatively 
restricted and sterile point of view whereupon many valuable and sensible aspects of things 
automatically go by the board the vertiginous abundance of the socalled scientific literature of 
today owes a deplorably high percentage of its existence to this misorientation  
 the extraverted thinking type  
it is a fact of experience that all  the basic psychological functions seldom or never have the same 
strength or grade of development in one and the same individual as a rule one or other function 
predominates in both strength and development when supremacy among the psychological 
functi ons is given to thinking  ie when the life of an individual is mainly ruled by reflective 
thinking so that every important action proceeds from intellectually considered motives or when 
there is at least a tendency to conform to such motives we may fai rly call this a thinking type 
such a type can be either introverted or extraverted we will first discuss the extraverted thinking 
type   
in accordance with his definition we must picture a man whose constant aim  in so far of 
course as he is a p  pure type  is to bring his total life activities into relation with 
intellectual conclusions which in the last resort are always orientated by objective data whether 
objective facts or generally valid ideas this type of man gives the deciding voi cenot merely for 
himself alone but also on behalf of his entourage either to the actual objective reality or to its 
objectively orientated intellectual formula by this formula are good and evil measured and 
beauty and ugliness determined all is right that corresponds with this formula all is wrong that 
contradicts it and everything that is neutral to it is purely accidental because this formula seems 
to correspond with the meaning of the world it also becomes a world law whose realization must 
be achieved at all times and seasons both individually and collectively just as the extraverted 
thinking type subordinates himself to his formula so for its own good must his entourage also 
obey it since the man who refuses to obey is wrong  he is resi sting the world law and is 
therefore unreasonable immoral and without a conscience his moral code forbids him to 
tolerate exceptions his ideal must under all circumstances be realized for in his eyes it is the 
purest conceivable formulation of ob jective reality and therefore must also be generally valid 
truth quite indispensable for the salvation of man this is not from any great love for his 
neighbour but from a higher standpoint of justice and truth everything in his own nature that 
appea rs to invalidate this formula is mere imperfection an accidental miss fire something to be 
eliminated on the next occasion or in the event of further failure then clearly a sickness  
if tolerance for the sick the suffering or the deranged should ch ance to be an ingredient in the 
formula special provisions will be devised for humane societies hospitals prisons colonies

etc or at least extensive plans for such projects for the actual execution of these schemes the 
p  motives of justice a nd truth do not as a rule suffice still devolve upon real christian 
charity which i to do with feeling than with any intellectual one really should or i one must 
figure largely in this programme if the formula is wide enough it may play a very use ful rle in 
social life with a reformer or a ventilator of public wrongs or a purifier of the public conscience 
or as the propagator of important innovations but the more rigid the formula the more does he 
develop into a grumbler a crafty reasoner a nd a self righteous critic who would like to impress 
both himself and others into one schema  
we have now outlined two extreme figures between which terminals the majority of these types 
may be graduated  
in accordance with the nature of the extraverte d attitude the influence and activities of such 
personalities are all the more favourable and beneficent the further one goes from the centre 
their best aspect is to be found at the periphery of their sphere of influence the further we 
penetrate into t heir own province the more do the unfavourable results of their tyranny impress 
us another life still pulses at the periphery where the truth of the formula can be sensed as an 
estimable adjunct to the rest but the further we probe into the special sph ere where the formula 
operates the more do we find life ebbing away from all that fails to coincide with its dictates 
usually it is the nearest relatives who have to taste the most disagreeable results of an 
extraverted formula since they are the first to be unmercifully blessed with it but above all the 
subject himself is the one who suffers most  which brings us to the other side of the psychology 
of this type  
the fact that an intellectual formula never has been and never will be discovered which could 
embrace the p  abundant possibilities of life in a fitting expression must lead  where such 
a formula is accepted  to an inhibition or total exclusion of other highly important forms and 
activities of life in the first place all those v ital forms dependent upon feeling will become 
repressed in such a type as for instance aesthetic activities taste artistic sense the art of 
friendship etc irrational forms such as religious experiences passions and the like are often 
obliterated  even to the point of complete unconsciousness these conditionally quite important 
forms of life have to support an existence that is largely unconscious doubtless there are 
exceptional men who are able to sacrifice their entire life to one definite fo rmula but for most of 
us a permanent life of such exclusiveness is impossible sooner or later  in accordance with 
outer circumstances and inner gifts  the forms of life repressed by the intellectual attitude 
become indirectly perceptible through a g radual disturbance of the conscious conduct of life 
whenever disturbances of this kind reach a definite intensity one speaks of a neurosis in most 
cases however it does not go so far because the individual instinctively allows himself some 
preventive  extenuations of his formula worded of course in a suitable and reasonable way in 
this way a safety valve is created  
the relative or total unconsciousness of such tendencies or functions as are excluded from any 
participation in the conscious attitud e keeps them in a relatively undeveloped state as compared 
with the conscious function they are inferior to the extent that they are unconscious they 
become merged with the remaining contents of the unconscious from which they acquire a

bizarre charact er to the extent that they are conscious they only play a secondary rle although 
one of considerable importance for the whole psychological picture  
since feelings are the first to oppose and contradict p  the rigid intellectual formula they 
are affected first this conscious inhibition and upon them the most intense repression falls no 
function can be entirely eliminated  it can only be greatly distorted in so far as feelings allow 
themselves to be arbitrarily shaped and subordinated they have to support the intellectual 
conscious attitude and adapt themselves to its aims only to a certain degree however is this 
possible a part of the feeling remains insubordinate and therefore must be repressed should the 
repression succeed it disap pears from consciousness and proceeds to unfold a subconscious 
activity which runs counter to conscious aims even producing effects whose causation is a 
complete enigma to the individual for example conscious altruism often of an extremely high 
order  may be crossed by a secret self seeking of which the individual is wholly unaware and 
which impresses intrinsically unselfish actions with the stamp of selfishness purely ethical aims 
may lead the individual into critical situations which sometimes ha ve more than a semblance of 
being decided by quite other than ethical motives there are guardians of public morals or 
voluntary rescue workers who suddenly find themselves in deplorably compromising situations 
or in dire need of rescue their resolve to save often leads them to employ means which only 
tend to precipitate what they most desire to avoid there are extraverted idealists whose desire 
to advance the salvation of man is so consuming that they will not shrink from any lying and 
dishonest means in the pursuit of their ideal there are a few painful examples in science where 
investigators of the highest esteem from a profound conviction of the truth and general validity 
of their formula have not scrupled to falsify evidence in favour of their id eal this is sanctioned 
by the formula the end justifieth the means only an inferior feeling function operating 
seductively p  and unconsciously could bring about such aberrations in otherwise 
reputable men  
the inferiority of feeling in this ty pe manifests itself also in other ways in so far as it 
corresponds with the dominating positive formula the conscious attitude becomes more or less 
impersonal often indeed to such a degree that a very considerable wrong is done to personal 
interests when the conscious attitude is extreme all personal considerations recede from view 
even those which concern the individuals own person his health is neglected his social position 
deteriorates often the most vital interests of his family are violated   they are wronged morally 
and financially even their bodily health is made to suffer  all in the service of the ideal at all 
events personal sympathy with others must be impaired unless they too chance to be in the 
service of the same formula henc e it not infrequently happens that his immediate family circle 
his own children for instance only know such a father as a cruel tyrant whilst the outer world 
resounds with the fame of his humanity not so much in spite of as because of the highly 
impers onal character of the conscious attitude the unconscious feelings are highly personal and 
oversensitive giving rise to certain secret prejudices as for instance a decided readiness to 
misconstrue any objective opposition to his formula as personal ill will or a constant tendency to 
make negative suppositions regarding the qualities of others in order to invalidate their 
arguments beforehand in defence naturally of his own susceptibility as a result of this 
unconscious sensitiveness his expression and tone frequently becomes sharp pointed 
aggressive and insinuations multiply the feelings have an untimely and halting character 
which is always a mark of the inferior function hence arises a pronounced tendency to

resentment however generous the individual sacrifice p  to the intellectual goal may be 
the feelings are correspondingly petty suspicious crossgrained and conservative everything 
new that is not already contained formula is viewed through a veil of unconscious and is judged 
accordingly it happened only in middle of last century that a certain physician famed his 
humanitarianism threatened to dismiss an assistant for daring to use a thermometer because the 
formula decreed that fever shall be recognized by the pulse there ar e of course a host of 
similar examples  
thinking which in other respects may be altogether blameless becomes all the more subtly and 
prejudicially affected the more feelings are repressed an intellectual standpoint which 
perhaps on account of its a ctual intrinsic value might justifiably claim general recognition 
undergoes a characteristic alteration through the influence of this unconscious personal 
sensitiveness it becomes rigidly dogmatic the personal self assertion is transferred to the 
intellectual standpoint truth is no longer left to work her natural effect but through an 
identification with the subject she is treated like a sensitive darling whom an evil minded critic 
has wronged the critic is demolished if possible with personal invec tive and no argument is 
too gross to be used against him truth must be trotted out until finally it begins to dawn upon 
the public that it is not so much really a question of truth as of her personal procreator  
the dogmatism of the intellectual standp oint however occasionally undergoes still further 
peculiar modifications from the unconscious admixture of unconscious personal feelings these 
changes are less a question of feeling in the stricter sense than of contamination from other 
unconscious fa ctors which become blended with the repressed feeling in the unconscious 
although reason itself offers proof that every intellectual formula can be no more than p  a 
partial truth and can never lay claim therefore to autocratic authority in pra ctice the formula 
obtains so great an ascendancy that beside it every other standpoint and possibility recedes into 
the background it replaces all the more general less defined hence the more modest and 
truthful views of life it even takes the plac e of that general view of life which we call religion 
thus the formula becomes a religion although in essentials it has not the smallest connection 
with anything religious therewith it also gains the essentially religious character of 
absoluteness it b ecomes as it were an intellectual superstition but now all those psychological 
tendencies that suffer under its repression become grouped together in the unconscious and form 
a counter position giving rise to paroxysms of doubt as a defence against d oubt the conscious 
attitude grows fanatical for fanaticism after all is merely overcompensated doubt ultimately 
this development leads to an exaggerated defence of the conscious position and to the gradual 
formation of an absolutely antithetic uncons cious position for example an extreme irrationality 
develops in opposition to the conscious rationalism or it becomes highly archaic and 
superstitious in opposition to a conscious standpoint imbued with modern science this fatal 
opposition is the sou rce of those narrow minded and ridiculous views familiar to the historians 
of science into which many praiseworthy pioneers have ultimately blundered it not infrequently 
happens in a man of this type that the side of the unconscious becomes embodied in a woman  
in my experience this type which is doubtless familiar to my readers is chiefly found among 
men since thinking tends to be a much more dominant function in men than in women as a 
rule when thinking achieves the mastery in women it is in m y experience a kind of thinking 
which results from a prevailingly intuitive activity of mind p

the thought of the extraverted thinking type is positive ie it produces it either leads to new 
facts or to general conceptions of disparate experi mental material its judgment is generally 
synthetic even when it analyses it constructs because it is always advancing beyond the 
analysis to a new combination a further conception which reunites the analysed material in a 
new way or adds some thin g further to the given material in general therefore we may 
describe this kind of judgment as predicative in any case characteristic that it is never 
absolutely depreciatory or destructive but always substitutes a fresh value for one that is 
demolish ed this quality is due to the fact that thought is the main channel into which a thinking 
types energy flows life steadily advancing shows itself in the mans thinking so that his ideas 
maintain a progressive creative character his thinking neither s tagnates nor is it in the least 
regressive such qualities cling only to a thinking that is not given priority in consciousness in 
this event it is relatively unimportant and also lacks the character of a positive vital activity it 
follows in the wake of other functions it becomes epimethean it has an esprit de lescalier 
quality contenting itself with constant ponderings and broodings upon things past and gone in 
an effort to analyse and digest them where the creative element as in this case i nhabits another 
function thinking no longer progresses it stagnates its judgment takes on a decided inherency 
character ie it entirely confines itself to the range of the given material nowhere overstepping 
it it is contented with a more or less abs tract statement and fails to impart any value to the 
experimental material that was not already there  
the inherency judgment of such extraverted thinking is objectively orientated ie its conclusion 
always expresses the objective importance of experie nce hence not only does it remain under 
the orientating influence of objective p   
data but it actually rests within the charmed circle of the individual experience about which it 
affirms nothing that was not already given by it we may easily ob serve this thinking in those 
people who cannot refrain from tacking on to an impression or experience some rational and 
doubtless very valid remark which however in no way adventures beyond the given orbit of the 
experience at bottom such a remark mer ely says i have understood it  i can reconstruct it 
but there the matter also ends at its very highest such a judgment signifies merely the placing 
of an experience in an objective setting whereby the experience is at once recognized as 
belonging t o the frame  
but whenever a function other than thinking possesses priority in consciousness to any marked 
degree in so far as thinking is conscious at all and not directly dependent upon the dominant 
function it assumes a negative character in so far as it is subordinated to the dominant function 
it may actually wear a positive aspect but a narrower scrutiny will easily prove that it simply 
mimics the dominant function supporting it with arguments that unmistakably contradict the 
laws of logic prope r to thinking such a thinking therefore ceases to have any interest for our 
present discussion our concern is rather with the constitution of that thinking which cannot be 
subordinated to the dominance of another function but remains true to its own p rinciple to 
observe and investigate this thinking in itself is not easy since in the concrete case it is more or 
less constantly repressed by the conscious attitude hence in the majority of cases it first must 
be retrieved from the background of con sciousness unless in some unguarded moment it should 
chance to come accidentally to the surface as a rule it must be enticed with some such 
questions as now what do you really  think or again what is your private view p  about

the matter or  perhaps one may even use a little cunning framing the question something this 
what do you imagine then that i really think about the matter this latter form should be 
chosen when the real thinking is unconscious and therefore projected the thinki ng that is 
enticed to the surface this way has characteristic qualities it was these i had in mind just now 
when i described it as negative it habitual mode is best characterized by the two words nothing 
but goethe personified this thinking in the fig ure of mephistopheles it shows a most distinctive 
tendency to trace back the object of its judgment to some banality or other thus stripping it of its 
own independent significance this happens simply because it is represented as being dependent 
upon som e other commonplace thing wherever a conflict apparently essential in nature arises 
between two men negative thinking mutters cherchez la femme when a man champions or 
advocates a cause negative thinking makes no inquiry as to the importance of the  thing but 
merely asks how much does he make by it the dictum ascribed to moleschott der mensch 
ist was er isst  man is what he eats  also belongs to this collection as do many more 
aphorisms and opinions which i need not enumerate  
the destr uctive quality of this thinking as well as its occasional and limited usefulness hardly 
need further elucidation but there still exists another form of negative thinking which at first 
glance perhaps would scarcely be recognized as such i refer to the theosophical thinking which 
is today rapidly spreading in every quarter of the globe presumably as a reaction phenomenon 
to the materialism of the epoch now receding theosophical thinking has an air that is not in the 
least reductive since it exalts eve rything to transcendental and world embracing ideas a dream 
for instance is no p  longer a modest dream but an experience upon another plane the 
hitherto inexplicable fact of telepathy is very simply explained by vibrations which pass from 
one man to another an ordinary nervous trouble is quite simply accounted for by the fact that 
something has collided with the astral body certain anthropological peculiarities of the dwellers 
on the atlantic seaboard are easily explained by the submergin g of atlantis and so on we have 
merely to open a theosophical book to be overwhelmed by the realization that everything is 
already explained and that spiritual science has left no enigmas of life unsolved but 
fundamentally this sort of thinking is just as negative as materialistic thinking when the latter 
conceives psychology as chemical changes taking place in the cell ganglia or as the extrusion 
and withdrawal of cell processes or as an internal secretion in essence this is just as 
superstitio us as theosophy the only difference lies in the fact that materialism reduces all 
phenomena to our current physiological notions while theosophy brings everything into the 
concepts of indian metaphysics when we trace the dream to an overloaded stomach the dream 
is not thereby explained and when we explain telepathy as vibrations we have said just as little 
since what are vibrations not only are both methods of explanation quite impotent  they are 
actually destructive because by interposing t heir seeming explanations they withdraw interest 
from the problem diverting it in the former case to the stomach and in the latter to imaginary 
vibrations thus preventing any serious investigation of the problem either kind of thinking is 
both sterile and sterilizing their negative quality consists in this it is a method of thought that is 
indescribably cheap there is a real poverty of productive and creative energy it is a thinking 
taken in tow by other functions p   
 feeling

feeling in the extraverted attitude is orientated by objective data ie the object is the 
indispensable determinant of the kind of feeling it agrees with objective values if one has 
always known feeling as a subjective fact the nature of extraverted feeling will not  immediately 
be understood since it has freed itself as fully as possible from the subjective factor and has 
instead become wholly subordinated to the influence of the object even where it seems to show 
a certain independence of the quality of the con crete object it is none the less under the spell of 
traditional or generally valid standards of some sort i may feel constrained for instance to use 
the predicate beautiful or good not because i find the object beautiful or good from my own 
subjective feeling but because it is fitting and politic so to do and fitting it certainly is 
inasmuch as a contrary opinion would disturb the general feeling situation a feeling judgment 
such as this is in no way a simulation or a lie  it is merely a n act of accommodation a picture 
for instance may be termed beautiful because a picture that is hung in a drawing room and 
bearing a well known signature is generally assumed to be beautiful or because the predicate 
ugly might offend the family of t he fortunate possessor or because there is a benevolent 
intention on the part of the visitor to create a pleasant feeling atmosphere to which end 
everything must be felt as agreeable such feelings are governed by the standard of the objective 
determinan ts as such they are genuine and represent the total visible feeling function  
in precisely the same way as extraverted thinking strives to rid itself of subjective influences 
extraverted feeling has also to undergo a certain process of differentiation  before it is finally 
denuded of every subjective p  trimming the valuations resulting from the act of feeling 
either correspond directly with objective values or at least chime in with certain traditional and 
generally known standards of value thi s kind of feeling is very largely responsible for the fact 
that so many people flock to the theatre to concerts or to church and what is more with 
correctly adjusted positive feelings fashions too owe their existence to it and what is far more 
valuable the whole positive and wide spread support of social philanthropic and such like 
cultural enterprises in such matters extraverted feeling proves itself a creative factor without 
this feeling for instance a beautiful and harmonious sociability  would be unthinkable so far 
extraverted feeling is just as beneficent and rationally effective as extraverted thinking but this 
salutary effect is lost as soon as the object gains an exaggerated influence for when this 
happens extraverted feeling dra ws the personality too much into the object ie the object 
assimilates the person whereupon the personal character of the feeling which constitutes its 
principal charm is lost feeling then becomes cold material untrustworthy it betrays a secret 
aim or at least arouses the suspicion of it in an impartial observer no longer does it make that 
welcome and refreshing impression the invariable accompaniment of genuine feeling instead 
one scents a pose or affectation although the egocentric motive ma y be entirely unconscious  
such overstressed extraverted feeling certainly fulfils sthetic expectations but no longer does 
it speak to the heart it merely appeals to the senses or  worse still  to the reason doubtless it 
can provide sthetic pad ding for a situation but there it stops and beyond that its effect is nil it 
has become sterile should this process go further a strangely contradictory dissociation of 
feeling develops every object is seized upon with feeling  p  valuations a nd numerous 
relationships are made which are inherently and mutually incompatible since such aberrations 
would be quite impossible if a sufficiently emphasized subject were present the last vestige of a 
real personal standpoint also becomes suppressed t he subject becomes so swallowed up in 
individual feeling processes that to the observer it seems as though there were no longer a subject 
psychological types

of feeling but merely a feeling process in such a condition feeling has entirely forfeited its 
original human warmth  it gives an impression of pose inconstancy unreliability and in the 
worst cases appears definitely hysterical  
 the extraverted feeling type  
in so far as feeling is incontestably a more obvious peculiarity of feminine psychology than 
thinking the  most pronounced feeling types are also to be found among women when 
extraverted feeling possesses the priority we speak of an extraverted feeling type examples of 
this type that i can call to mind are almost without exception women she is a woman who  
follows the guiding line of her feeling as the result of education her feeling has become 
developed into an adjusted function subject to conscious control except in extreme cases 
feeling has a personal character in spite of the fact that the subjecti ve factor may be already to a 
large extent repressed the personality appears to be adjusted in relation to objective conditions 
her feelings correspond with objective situations and general values nowhere is this more 
clearly revealed than in the so called love choice the suitable man is loved not another one he 
is suitable not so much because he fully accords with the fundamental character of the woman  
as a rule she is quite uninformed about this  but because p  he meticulously corre sponds 
in standing age capacity height and family respectability with every reasonable requirement 
such a formulation might of course be easily rejected as ironical or depreciatory were i not 
fully convinced that the love feeling of this type of wo man completely corresponds with her 
choice it is genuine and not merely intelligently manufactured such reasonable marriages 
exist without number and they are by no means the worst such women are good comrades to 
their husbands and excellent mothers  so long as husbands or children possess the conventional 
psychic constitution one can feel correctly however only when feeling is disturbed by nothing 
else but nothing disturbs feeling so much as thinking it is at once intelligible therefore tha t 
this type should repress thinking as much as possible this does not mean to say that such a 
woman does not think at all on the contrary she may even think a great deal and very ably but 
her thinking is never sui generis it is in fact an epimethean  appendage to her feeling what she 
cannot feel she cannot consciously think but i cant think what i dont feel such a type said to 
me once in indignant tones as far as feeling permits she can think very well but every 
conclusion however logical  that might lead to a disturbance of feeling is rejected from the 
outset it is simply not thought and thus everything that corresponds with objective valuations is 
good these things are loved or treasured the rest seems merely to exist in a world apart   
but a change comes over the picture when the importance of the object reaches a still higher 
level as already explained above such an assimilation of subject to object then occurs as almost 
completely to engulf the subject of feeling feeling loses it s personal character  it becomes 
feeling per se it almost seems as though the p  personality were wholly dissolved in the 
feeling of the moment now since in actual life situations constantly and successively alternate 
in which the feeling tones  released are not only different but are actually mutually contrasting 
the personality inevitably becomes dissipated in just so many different feelings apparently he is 
this one moment and something completely different the next  apparently i repeat  for in 
reality such a manifold personality is altogether impossible the basis of the ego always remains 
identical with itself and therefore appears definitely opposed to the changing states of feeling 
accordingly the observer senses the display of f eeling not so much as a personal expression of

the feeling subject as an alteration of his ego a mood in other words corresponding with the 
degree of dissociation between the ego and the momentary state of feeling signs of disunion 
with the self will b ecome more or less evident ie the original compensatory attitude of the 
unconscious becomes a manifest opposition this reveals itself in the first instance in 
extravagant demonstrations of feeling in loud and obtrusive feeling predicates which leav e one 
however somewhat incredulous they ring hollow they are not convincing on the contrary 
they at once give one an inkling of a resistance that is being overcompensated and one begins to 
wonder whether such a feeling judgment might not just as wel l be entirely different in fact in a 
very short time it actually is different only a very slight alteration in the situation is needed to 
provoke forthwith an entirely contrary estimation of the selfsame object the result of such an 
experience is that the observer is unable to take either judgment at all seriously he begins to 
reserve his own opinion but since with this type it is a matter of the greatest moment to 
establish an intensive feeling rapport with his environment redoubled efforts are no w required 
p  to overcome this reserve thus in the manner of the circulus vitiosus the situation goes 
from bad to worse the more the feeling relation with the object becomes overstressed the 
nearer the unconscious opposition approaches the surfa ce  
we have already seen that the extraverted feeling type as a rule represses his thinking just 
because thinking is the function most liable to disturb feeling similarly when thinking seeks to 
arrive at pure results of any kind its first act is to exclude feeling since nothing is calculated to 
harass and falsify thinking so much as feeling values thinking therefore in so far as it is an 
independent function is repressed in the extraverted feeling type its repression as i observed 
before is c omplete only in so far as its inexorable logic forces it to conclusions that are 
incompatible with feeling it is suffered to exist as the servant of feeling or more accurately its 
slave its backbone is broken it may not operate on its own account in a ccordance with its own 
laws now since a logic exists producing inexorably right conclusions this must happen 
somewhere although beyond the bounds of consciousness ie in the unconscious pre 
eminently therefore the unconscious content of this type is a particular kind of thinking it is an 
infantile archaic and negative thinking  
so long as conscious feeling preserves the personal character or in other words so long as the 
personality does not become swallowed up by successive states of feelin g this unconscious 
thinking remains compensatory but as soon as the personality is dissociated becoming 
dispersed in mutually contradictory states of feeling the identity of the ego is lost and the 
subject becomes unconscious but because of the subj ects lapse into the unconscious it 
becomes associated with the unconscious thinking  function therewith assisting the 
unconscious p  thought to occasional consciousness the stronger the conscious feeling 
relation and therefore the more deper sonalized it becomes the stronger grows the unconscious 
opposition this reveals itself in the fact that unconscious ideas centre round just the most valued 
objects which are thus pitilessly stripped of their value that thinking which always thinks in  the 
nothing but style is in its right place here since it destroys the ascendancy of the feeling that is 
chained to the object  
unconscious thought reaches the surface in the form of irruptions often of an obsessing nature 
the general character of w hich is always negative and depreciatory women of this type have 
moments when the most hideous thoughts fasten upon the very objects most valued by their

feelings this negative thinking avails itself of every infantile prejudice or parallel that is 
calcu lated to breed doubt in the feeling value and it tows every primitive instinct along with it 
in the effort to make a nothing but interpretation of the feeling at this point it is perhaps in the 
nature of a side remark to observe that the collective u nconscious ie the totality of the 
primordial images also becomes enlisted in the same manner and from the elaboration and 
development of these images there dawns the possibility of a regeneration of the attitude upon 
another basis  
hysteria with the  characteristic infantile sexuality of its unconscious world of ideas is the 
principal form of neurosis with this type  
 recapitulation of extraverted rational types  
i term the two preceding types rational or judging types because they are characterize d by the 
supremacy of the reasoning and the judging functions it is a general distinguishing mark of both 
types that their life is to a p  large extent subordinated to reasoning judgment but we 
must not overlook the point whether by reasoning we are referring to the standpoint of the 
individuals subjective psychology or to the standpoint of the observer who perceives and 
judges from without for such an observer could easily arrive at an opposite judgment especially 
if he has a merely intui tive apprehension of the behaviour of the observed and judges 
accordingly in its totality the life of this type is never dependent upon reasoning judgment 
alone it is influenced in almost equal degree by unconscious irrationality if observation is 
restricted to behaviour without any concern for the domestic interior of the individuals 
consciousness one may get an even stronger impression of the irrational and accidental character 
of certain unconscious manifestations in the individuals behaviour th an of the reasonableness of 
his conscious purposes and motivations i therefore base my judgment upon what the individual 
feels to be his conscious psychology but i am prepared to grant that we may equally well 
entertain a precisely opposite conception of such a psychology and present it accordingly i am 
also convinced that had i myself chanced to possess a different individual psychology i should 
have described the rational types in the reversed way from the standpoint of the unconscious as 
irratio nal therefore this circumstance aggravates the difficulty of a lucid presentation of 
psychological matters to a degree not to be underestimated and immeasurably increases the 
possibility of misunderstandings the discussions which develop from these mis understandings 
are as a rule quite hopeless since the real issue is never joined each side speaking as it were 
in a different tongue such experience is merely one reason the more for basing my presentation 
upon the subjective conscious psychology of  the individual since there at least one has a 
definite objective footing which completely p  drops away the moment we try to ground 
psychological principles upon the unconscious for the observed in this case could undertake no 
kind of co operation because there is nothing of which he is not more informed than his own 
unconscious the judgment would entirely devolve upon the observer  a certain guarantee that 
its basis would be his own individual psychology which would infallibly be imposed  upon the 
observed to my mind this is the case in the psychologies both of freud and of adler the 
individual is completely at the mercy of the arbitrary discretion of his observing critic  which 
can never be the case when the conscious psychology of t he observed is accepted as the basis 
after all he is the only competent judge since he alone knows his own motives

the reasonableness that characterizes the conscious management of life in both these types 
involves a conscious exclusion of the accide ntal and non rational reasoning judgment in such a 
psychology represents a power that coerces the untidy and accidental things of life into definite 
forms such at least is its aim thus on the one hand a definite choice is made among the 
possibilitie s of life since only the rational choice is consciously accepted but on the other hand 
the independence and influence of those psychic functions which perceive lifes happenings are 
essentially restricted this limitation of sensation and intuition is  of course not absolute these 
functions exist for they are universal but their products are subject to the choice of the 
reasoning judgment it is not the absolute strength of sensation for instance which turns the 
scales in the motivation of action  but judgment thus in a certain sense the perceiving 
functions share the same fate as feeling in the case of the first type or thinking in that of the 
second they are relatively repressed and therefore in an inferior state of differentiation this 
circumstance gives a particular stamp to the unconscious p  of both our types what such 
men do consciously and intentionally accords with reason their reason of course but what 
happens to them corresponds either with infantile primitive sensations  or with similarly archaic 
intuitions i will try to make clear what i mean by these latter concepts in the sections that 
follow at all events that which happens to this type is irrational from their own standpoint of 
course now since there are vast  numbers of men whose lives consist in what happens to them 
more than in actions resulting from reasoned intention it might conceivably happen that such a 
man after careful analysis would describe both our types as irrational we must grant him 
howeve r that only too often a mans unconscious makes a far stronger impression upon one than 
his conscious and that his actions often have considerably more weight and meaning than his 
reasoned motivations  
the rationality of both types is orientated objecti vely and depends upon objective data their 
reasonableness corresponds with what passes as reasonable from the collective standpoint 
subjectively they consider nothing rational save what is generally considered as such but reason 
is also very largely su bjective and individual in our case this share is repressed  increasingly 
so in fact the more the significance of the object is exalted both the subject and subjective 
reason therefore are always threatened with repression and when it descends th ey fall under 
the tyranny of the unconscious which in this case possesses most unpleasant qualities we have 
already spoken of its thinking but in addition there are primitive sensations which reveal 
themselves in compulsive forms as for instance a n abnormal compulsive pleasure seeking in 
every conceivable direction  there are also primitive intuitions which can become a positive 
torture to the individuals concerned not to mention their entourage everything disagreeable and 
painful everything d isgusting p  ugly and evil is scented out or suspected and these as a 
rule only correspond with half truths than which nothing is more calculated to create 
misunderstandings of the most poisonous kind the powerful influence of the opposing 
uncon scious contents necessarily brings about a frequent interruption of the rational conscious 
government namely a striking subservience to the element of chance so that either by virtue of 
their sensational value or unconscious significance accidental ha ppenings acquire a compelling 
influence  
 sensation

sensation in the extraverted attitude is most definitely conditioned by the object as sense 
perception sensation is naturally dependent upon the object but just as naturally it is also 
dependent  upon the subject hence there is also a subjective sensation which after its kind is 
entirely different from the objective in the extraverted attitude this subjective share of sensation 
in so far as its conscious application is concerned is either in hibited or repressed as an 
irrational function sensation is equally repressed whenever a rational function thinking or 
feeling possesses the priority ie it can be said to have a conscious function only in so far as the 
rational attitude of consciou sness permits accidental perceptions to become conscious contents 
in short realizes them the function of sense is of course absolute in the stricter sense for 
example everything is seen or heard to the farthest physiological possibility but not eve rything 
attains that threshold value which a perception must possess in order to be also apperceived it is 
a different matter when sensation itself possesses priority instead of merely seconding another 
function in this case no element of objective sen sation is excluded and nothing repressed with 
the exception of the subjective share p  already mentioned sensation has a preferential 
objective determination and those objects which release the strongest sensation are decisive for 
the individual s psychology the result of this is a pronounced sensuous hold to the object 
sensation therefore is a vital function equipped with the potentest sic vital instinct in so far 
as objects release sensations they matter and in so far as it lies withi n the power of sensation 
they are also fully accepted into consciousness whether compatible with reasoned judgment or 
not as a function its sole criterion of value is the strength of the sensation as conditioned by its 
objective qualities accordingly all objective processes in so far as they release sensations at all 
make their appearance in consciousness it is however only concrete sensuously perceived 
objects or processes which excite sensations in the extraverted attitude exclusively those i n fact 
which everyone in all times and places would sense as concrete hence the orientation of such 
an individual corresponds with purely concrete reality the judging rational functions are 
subordinated to the concrete facts of sensation and accordi ngly possess the qualities of inferior 
differentiation ie they are marked by a certain negativity with infantile and archaic tendencies 
the function most affected by the repression is naturally the one standing opposite to 
sensation viz intuitio n the function of unconscious perception  
 the extraverted sensation type  
no other human type can equal the extraverted sensation type in realism his sense for objective 
facts is extraordinarily developed his life is an accumulation of actual experie nce with concrete 
objects and the more pronounced he is the less use does he make of his experience in certain 
cases the events of his life hardly deserve p  the name experience he knows no better use 
for this sensed experience than to make i t serve as a guide to fresh sensations anything in the 
least new that comes within his circle of interest is forthwith turned to a sensational account and 
is made to serve this end in so far as one is disposed to regard a highly developed sense for 
sheer actuality as very reasonable will such men be esteemed rational in reality however this is 
by no means the case since they are equally subject to the sensation of irrational chance 
happenings as they are to rational behaviour  
such a type  the majority arc men apparently  does not of course believe himself to be 
subject to sensation he would be much more inclined to ridicule this view as altogether 
inconclusive since from his standpoint sensation is the concrete manifestation of life  it is

simply the fulness sic of actual living his aim is concrete enjoyment and his morality is 
similarly orientated for true enjoyment has its own special morality its own moderation and 
lawfulness its own unselfishness and devotedness it by no  means follows that he is just sensual 
or gross for he may differentiate his sensation to the finest pitch of sthetic purity without being 
the least unfaithful even in his most abstract sensations to his principle of objective sensation 
wulfens cicer one des rumlcksichtlosen lebensgenusses is the unvarnished confession of a 
type of this sort from this point of view the book seems to me worth reading  
upon the lower levels this is the man of tangible reality with little tendency either for reflecti on 
or commanding purpose to sense the object to have and if possible to enjoy sensations is his 
constant motive he is by no means unlovable on the contrary he frequently has a charming and 
lively capacity for enjoyment he is sometimes a jolly fellow  and often a refined sthete p 
  
in the former case the great problems of life hinge upon a good or indifferent dinner in the 
latter they are questions of good taste when he senses everything essential has been said and 
done nothing can be more than concrete and actual conjectures that transcend or go beyond the 
concrete are only permitted on condition that they enhance sensation this need not be in any 
way a pleasurable reinforcement since this type is not a common voluptuary he merely desires 
the strongest sensation and this by his very nature he can receive only from without what 
comes from within seems to him morbid and objectionable in so far as lie thinks and feels he 
always reduces down to objective foundations ie to influ ences coming from the object quite 
unperturbed by the most violent departures from logic tangible reality under any conditions 
makes him breathe again in this respect he is unexpectedly credulous he will without 
hesitation relate an obvious psychog enic symptom to the falling barometer while the existence 
of a psychic conflict seems to him a fantastic abnormality his love is incontestably rooted in the 
manifest attractions of the object in so far as he is normal he is conspicuously adjusted to 
positive reality  conspicuously because his adjustment is always visible his ideal is the actual 
in this respect he is considerate he has no ideals related to ideas  he has therefore no sort of 
ground for maintaining a hostile attitude towards the reality of things and facts this expresses 
itself in all the externals of his life he dresses well according to his circumstances  he keeps a 
good table for his friends who are either made comfortable or at least given to understand that 
his fastidiou s taste is obliged to impose certain claims upon his entourage he even convinces 
one that certain sacrifices are decidedly worth while for the sake of style  
but the more sensation predominates so that the p  sensing subject disappears behind the 
sensation the more unsatisfactory does this type become either he develops into a crude 
pleasure seeker or he becomes an unscrupulous designing sybarite although the object is 
entirely indispensable to him yet as something existing in and through its elf it is none the less 
depreciated it is ruthlessly violated and essentially ignored since now its sole use is to stimulate 
sensation the hold upon the object is pushed to the utmost limit the unconscious is 
accordingly forced out of its meaccent tier as a compensatory function and driven into open 
opposition but above all the repressed intuitions begin to assert themselves in the form of 
projections upon the object the strangest conjectures arise in the case of a sexual object 
jealous phanta sies and anxiety states play a great role more acute cases develop every sort of 
phobia and especially compulsive symptoms the pathological contents have a remarkable air of

unreality with a frequent moral or religious colouring a pettifogging captiou sness often 
develops or an absurdly scrupulous morality coupled with a primitive superstitious and 
magical religiosity harking back to abstruse rites all these things have their source in the 
repressed inferior functions which in such cases stand in harsh opposition to the conscious 
standpoint they wear in fact an aspect that is all the more striking because they appear to rest 
upon the most absurd suppositions in complete contrast to the conscious sense of reality the 
whole culture of thought  and feeling seems in this second personality to be twisted into a 
morbid primitiveness reason is hair splitting sophistry  morality is dreary moralizing and 
palpable pharisaism  religion is absurd superstition  intuition the noblest of human gif ts is a 
mere personal subtlety a sniffing into every corner instead of searching the horizon it recedes 
to the narrowest gauge of human meanness p   
the specially compulsive character of the neurotic symptoms represent the unconscious 
counterwei ght to the laisser aller morality of a purely sensational attitude which from the 
standpoint of rational judgment accepts without discrimination everything that happens 
although this lack of basic principles in the sensation type does not argue an abs olute 
lawlessness and lack of restraint it at least deprives him of the quite essential restraining power 
of judgment rational judgment represents a conscious coercion which the rational type appears 
to impose upon himself of his own free will this com pulsion overtakes the sensation type from 
the unconscious moreover the rational types link to the object from the very existence of a 
judgment never means such an unconditioned relation as that which the sensation type has with 
the object when his at titude reaches an abnormal one sidedness he is in danger of falling just as 
deeply into the arms of the unconscious as he consciously clings to the object when he becomes 
neurotic he is much harder to treat in the rational way because the functions to which the 
physician must appeal are in a relatively undifferentiated state hence little or no trust can be 
placed in them special means of bringing emotional pressure to bear are often needed to make 
him at all conscious  
 intuition  
intuition as the f unction of unconscious perception is wholly directed upon outer objects in the 
extraverted attitude because in the main intuition is an unconscious process the conscious 
apprehension of its nature is a very difficult matter in consciousness the intui tive function is 
represented by a certain attitude of expectation a perceptive and penetrating vision wherein only 
the subsequent result can prove in every case how much was p  perceived into and how 
much actually lay in the object  
just as s ensation when given the priority is not a mere reactive process of no further importance 
for the object but is almost an action which seizes and shapes the object so it is with intuition 
which is by no means a mere perception or awareness but an act ive creative process that builds 
into the object just as much as it takes out but because this process extracts the perception 
unconsciously it also produces an unconscious effect in the object the primary function of 
intuition is to transmit mere ima ges or perceptions of relations and conditions which could be 
gained by the other functions either not at all or only by very roundabout ways such images 
have the value of definite discernments and have a decisive bearing upon action whenever 
intuition is given the chief weight in which case psychic adaptation is based almost exclusively

upon intuition thinking feeling and sensation are relatively repressed of these sensation is the 
one principally affected because as the conscious function of sense it offers the greatest 
obstacle to intuition sensation disturbs intuitions clear unbiassed naumlautive awareness 
with its importunate sensuous stimuli for these direct the glance upon the physical superficies 
hence upon the very things ro und and beyond which intuition tries to peer but since intuition in 
the extraverted attitude has a prevailingly objective orientation it actually comes very near to 
sensation indeed the expectant attitude towards outer objects may with almost equal 
probability avail itself of sensation hence for intuition really to become paramount sensation 
must to a large extent be suppressed i am now speaking of sensation as the simple and direct 
sense reaction an almost definite physiological and psychic da tum this must be expressly 
established beforehand because if i ask the intuitive how he is p  orientated he will speak 
of things which are quite indistinguishable from sense perceptions frequently he will even make 
use of the term sensation h e actually has sensations but he is not guided by them per se 
merely using them as directing points for his distant vision they are selected by unconscious 
expectation not the strongest sensation in the physiological sense obtains the crucial value but 
any sensation whatsoever whose value happens to become considerably enhanced by reason of 
the intuitives unconscious attitude in this way it may eventually attain the leading position 
appearing to the intuitives consciousness indistinguishable from  a pure sensation but actually it 
is not so  
just as extraverted sensation strives to reach the highest pitch of actuality because only thus can 
the appearance of a complete life be created so intuition tries to encompass the greatest 
possibilities since only through the awareness of possibilities is intuition fullysatisfied intuition 
seeks to discover possibilities in the objective situation hence as a mere tributary function viz 
when not in the position of priority it is also the instrument whic h in the presence of a 
hopelessly blocked situation works automatically towards the issue which no other function 
could discover where intuition has the priority every ordinary situation in life seems like a 
closed room which intuition has to open i t is constantly seeking outlets and fresh possibilities in 
external life in a very short time every actual situation becomes a prison to the intuitive it 
burdens him like a chain prompting a compelling need for solution at times objects would 
seem to h ave an almost exaggerated value should they chance to represent the idea of a 
severance or release that might lead to the discovery of a new possibility yet no sooner have 
they performed their office serving intuition as a ladder or a bridge than they p  appear to 
have no further value and are discarded as mere burdensome appendages a fact is 
acknowledged only in so far as it opens up fresh possibilities of advancing beyond it and of 
releasing the individual from its operation emerging possibil ities are compelling motives from 
which intuition cannot escape and to which all else must be sacrificed  
 the extraverted intuitive type  
whenever intuition predominates a particular and unmistakable psychology presents itself 
because intuition is ori entated by the object a decided dependence upon external situations is 
discernible but it has an altogether different character from the dependence of the sensational 
type the intuitive is never to be found among the generally recognized reality values  but he is 
always present where possibilities exist he has a keen nose for things in the bud pregnant with 
future promise he can never exist in stable long established conditions of generally 
psychological types

acknowledged though limited value because his eye is constan tly ranging for new possibilities 
stable conditions have an air of impending suffocation he seizes hold of new objects and new 
ways with eager intensity sometimes with extraordinary enthusiasm only to abandon them cold 
bloodedly without regard and app arently without remembrance as soon as their range becomes 
clearly defined and a promise of any considerable future development no longer clings to them 
as long as a possibility exists the intuitive is bound to it with thongs of fate it is as though hi s 
whole life went out into the new situation one gets the impression which he himself shares that 
he has just reached the definitive turning point in his life and that from now on nothing else can 
seriously engage his thought and feeling how  p   ever reasonable and opportune it may 
be and although every conceivable argument speaks in favour of stability a day will come when 
nothing will deter him from regarding as a prison the self same situation that seemed to promise 
him freedom and delivera nce and from acting accordingly neither reason nor feeling can 
restrain or discourage him from a new possibility even though it may run counter to convictions 
hitherto unquestioned thinking and feeling the indispensable components of conviction are 
with him inferior functions possessing no decisive weight hence they lack the power to offer 
any lasting resistance to the force of intuition and yet these are the only functions that are 
capable of creating any effectual compensation to the supremacy  of intuition since they can 
provide the intuitive with that judgment in which his type is altogether lacking the morality of 
the intuitive is governed neither by intellect nor by feeling he has his own characteristic 
morality which consists in a loyal ty to his intuitive view of things and a voluntary submission to 
its authority consideration for the welfare of his neighbours is weak no solid argument hinges 
upon their well being any more than upon his own neither can we detect in him any great 
respe ct for his neighbours convictions and customs in fact he is not infrequently put down as an 
immoral and ruthless adventurer since his intuition is largely concerned with outer objects 
scenting out external possibilities he readily applies himself to callings wherein he may expand 
his abilities in many directions merchants contractors speculators agents politicians etc 
commonly belong to this type  
apparently this type is more prone to favour women than men in which case however the 
intuiti ve activity reveals itself not so much in the professional as in the social sphere such 
women understand the art of utilizing every social opportunity they establish right social con  
p  nections they seek out lovers with possibilities only to aba ndon everything again for the 
sake of a new possibility  
it is at once clear both from the standpoint of political economy and on grounds of general 
culture that such a type is uncommonly important if well intentioned with an orientation to life 
not p urely egoistical he may render exceptional service as the promoter if not the initiator of 
every kind of promising enterprise he is the natural advocate of every minority that holds the 
seed of future promise because of his capacity when orientated mo re towards men than things 
to make an intuitive diagnosis of their abilities and range of usefulness he can also make men 
his capacity to inspire his fellow men with courage or to kindle enthusiasm for something new 
is unrivalled although he may ha ve forsworn it by the morrow the more powerful and vivid his 
intuition the more is his subject fused and blended with the divined possibility he animates it 
he presents it in plastic shape and with convincing fire he almost embodies it it is not a me re 
histrionic display but a fate

this attitude has immense dangers  all too easily the intuitive may squander his life he spends 
himself animating men and things spreading around him an abundance of life  a life however 
which others live not he  were he able to rest with the actual thing he would gather the fruit of 
his labours yet all too soon must he be running after some fresh possibility quitting his newly 
planted field while others reap the harvest in the end he goes empty away but wh en the 
intuitive lets things reach such a pitch he also has the unconscious against him the unconscious 
of the intuitive has a certain similarity with that of the sensation type thinking and feeling 
being relatively repressed produce infantile and arc haic thoughts and feelings in the 
unconscious which may be compared p  with those of the countertype they likewise 
come to the surface in the form of intensive projections and are just as absurd as those of the 
sensation type only to my mind they  lack the others mystical character they are chiefly 
concerned with quasi actual things in the nature of sexual financial and other hazards as for 
instance suspicions of approaching illness this difference appears to be due to a repression of 
the sensations of actual things these latter usually command attention in the shape of a sudden 
entanglement with a most unsuitable woman or in the case of a woman with a thoroughly 
unsuitable man and this is simply the result of their unwitting contact w ith the sphere of archaic 
sensations but its consequence is an unconsciously compelling tie to an object of incontestable 
futility such an event is already a compulsive symptom which is also thoroughly characteristic 
of this type in common with the sen sation type he claims a similar freedom and exemption 
from all restraint since he suffers no submission of his decisions to rational judgment relying 
entirely upon the perception of chance possibilities he rids himself of the restrictions of reason 
only to fall a victim to unconscious neurotic compulsions in the form of oversubtle negative 
reasoning hair splitting dialectics and a compulsive tie to the sensation of the object his 
conscious attitude both to the sensation and the sensed object is one of sovereign superiority 
and disregard not that he means to be inconsiderate or superior  he simply does not see the 
object that everyone else sees his oblivion is similar to that of the sensation type  only with 
the latter the soul of the obje ct is missed for this oblivion the object sooner or later takes 
revenge in the form of hypochondriacal compulsive ideas phobias and every imaginable kind 
of absurd bodily sensation p   
 recapitulation of extraverted irrational types  
i call th e two preceding types irrational for reasons already referred to namely because their 
commissions and omissions are based not upon reasoned judgment but upon the absolute 
intensity of perception their perception is concerned with simple happenings wher e no 
selection has been exercised by the judgment in this respect both the latter types have a 
considerable superiority over the two judging types the objective occurrence is both law 
determined and accidental in so far as it is law determined it is ac cessible to reason in so far as 
it is accidental it is not one might reverse it and say that we apply the term law determined to 
the occurrence appearing so to our reason and where its regularity escapes us we call it 
accidental the postulate of a uni versal lawfulness remains a postulate of reason only in no 
sense is it a postulate of our functions of perception since these are in no way grounded upon 
the principle of reason and its postulates they are of their very nature irrational hence my ter m 
irrational corresponds with the nature of the perception types but merely because they 
subordinate judgment to perception it would be quite incorrect to regard these types as 
unreasonable they are merely in a high degree empirical they are grounded  exclusively upon 
psychological types

experience so exclusively in fact that as a rule their judgment cannot keep pace with their 
experience but the functions of judgment are none the less present although they eke out a 
largely unconscious existence but since the unc onscious in spite of its separation from the 
conscious subject is always reappearing on the scene the actual life of the irrational types 
exhibits striking judgments and acts of choice which take the form of apparent sophistries cold 
hearted criticism s and an apparently purposeful p  selection of persons and situations 
these traits have a rather infantile or even primitive stamp at times they are astonishingly 
naive but at times also inconsiderate crude or outrageous to the rationally or ientated mind the 
real character of such people might well appear rationalistic and purposeful in the bad sense but 
this judgment would be valid only for their unconscious and therefore quite incorrect for their 
conscious psychology which is entirely  orientated by perception and because of its irrational 
nature is quite unintelligible to the rational judgment finally it may even appear to a rationally 
orientated mind that such an assemblage of accidentals hardly deserves the name psychology 
the irrational type balances this contemptuous judgment with an equally poor impression of the 
rational for he sees him as something only half alive whose only aim in life consists in fastening 
the fetters of reason upon everything living and wringing his own neck with criticisms 
naturally these are gross extremes but they occur  
from the standpoint of the rational type the irrational might easily be represented as a rational of 
inferior quality namely when he is apprehended in the light of what happ ens to him for what 
happens to him is not the accidental in that he is master but in its stead he is overtaken by 
rational judgment and rational aims this fact is hardly comprehensible to the rational mind but 
its unthinkableness merely equals the ast onishment of the irrational when he discovers someone 
who can set the ideas of reason above the living and actual event such a thing seems scarcely 
credible to him it is as a rule quite hopeless to look to him for any recognition of principles in 
this direction since a rational understanding is just as unknown and in fact tiresome to him as 
the idea of making a contract without mutual discussion and obligations appears unthinkable to 
the rational type p   
this point brings me to the problem  of the psychic relation between the representatives of the 
different types following the terminology of the french school of hypnotists the psychic 
relation among the more modern psychiatrists is termed i rapport rapport chiefly consists in a 
feeling  of actual accord in spite of recognised differences in fact the recognition of existing 
differences in so far as they are common to both is already a rapport a feeling of accord if we 
make this feeling conscious to a rather high degree in an actual  case we discover that it has not 
merely the quality of a feeling that cannot be analysed further but it also has the nature of an 
insight or cognitional content representing the point of agreement in a conceptual form this 
rational presentation is exc lusively valid for the rational types it by no means applies to the 
irrational whose rapport is based not at all upon judgment but upon the parallelism of actual 
living events his feeling of accord is the common perception of a sensation or intuition t he 
rational would say that rapport with the irrational depends purely upon chance if by some 
accident the objective situations are exactly in tune something like a human relationship takes 
place but nobody can tell what will be either its validity or its duration to the rational type it is 
often a very bitter thought that the relationship will last only just so long as external 
circumstances accidentally produce a mutual interest this does not occur to him as being 
especially human whereas it is pre cisely in this situation that the irrational sees a humanity of

quite singular beauty accordingly each regards the other as a man destitute of relationships 
upon whom no reliance can be placed and with whom one can never get on decent terms such a 
result however is reached only when one consciously tries to make some estimate of the nature 
of ones relationships with ones fellow men although a psychological conscientiousness of p 
 this kind is by no means usual yet it frequently happens that  notwithstanding an absolute 
difference of standpoint a kind of rapport does take place and in the following way the one 
assumes with unspoken projection that the other is in all essential points of the same opinion as 
himself while the other divines  or senses an objective community of interest of which however 
the former has no conscious inkling and whose existence he would at once dispute just as it 
would never occur to the latter that his relationship must rest upon a common point ofview a 
rapport of this kind is by far the most frequent it rests upon projection which is the source of 
many subsequent misunderstandings  
psychic relationship in the extraverted attitude is always regulated by objective factors and 
outer determinants what a man is within has never any decisive significance for our present 
day culture the extraverted attitude is the governing principle in the problem of human 
relationship naturally the introverted principle occurs but it is still the exception and has to 
appeal to the tolerance of the age  
c the introverted type   
i the general attitude of consciousness  
as i have already explained in section a  of the present chapter the introverted is 
distinguished from the extraverted type by the fact that unlike  the latter who is prevailingly 
orientated by the object and objective data he is governed by subjective factors in the section 
alluded to i mentioned inter alia that the introvert interposes a subjective view between the 
perception of the object and his own action which prevents the action from assuming a character 
that corresponds with the objective situation naturally this is a special case mentioned by way 
of p  example and merely intended to serve as a simple illustration but now we mu st go 
in quest of more general formulations  
introverted consciousness doubtless views the external conditions but it selects the subjective 
determinants as the decisive ones the type is guided therefore by that factor of perception and 
cognition whic h represents the receiving subjective disposition to the sense stimulus two 
persons for example see the same object but they never see it in such a way as to receive two 
identically similar images of it quite apart from the differences in the personal  equation and 
mere organic acuteness there often exists a radical difference both in kind and degree in the 
psychic assimilation of the perceived image whereas the extraverted type refers pre eminently 
to that which reaches him from the object the int rovert principally relies upon that which the 
outer impression constellates  sic in the subject in an individual case of apperception the 
difference may of course be very delicate but in the total psychological economy it is 
extremely noticeable esp ecially in the form of a reservation of the ego although it is 
anticipating somewhat i consider that point of view which inclines with weininger to describe 
this attitude as philautic or with other writers as autoerotic egocentric subjective or eg oistic to

of the extraverted attitude against the nature of the introvert we must not forget although 
extraverted opinion is only too prone to do so that all  perception and cognition is not purely 
objective it is also subjectively conditioned the world exists not merely in itself but also as it 
appears to me indeed at bottom we have absolutely no criterion that could help us to form a 
judgment of a world  whose nature was unassimilable by the subject if we were to ignore the 
subjective factor it p  would mean a complete denial of the great doubt as to the possibility 
of absolute cognition and this would mean a rechute into that stale and hollow po sitivism which 
disfigured the beginning of our epoch  an attitude of intellectual arrogance that is invariably 
accompanied by a crudeness of feeling and an essential violation of life as stupid as it is 
presumptuous through an overvaluation of the obj ective powers of cognition we repress the 
importance of the subjective factor which simply means the denial of the subject but what is the 
subject the subject is man  we are the subject only a sick mind could forget that cognition 
must have a subjec t for there exists no knowledge and therefore for us no world where i know 
has not been said although with this statement one has already expressed the subjective 
limitation of all knowledge  
the same holds good for all the psychic functions they have a subject which is just as 
indispensable as the object it is characteristic of our present extraverted valuation that the word 
subjective occasionally rings almost like a reproach or blemish but in every case the epithet 
merely subjective means a dangerous weapon of offence destined for that daring head that is 
not unceasingly convinced of the unconditioned superiority of the object we must therefore be 
quite clear as to what meaning the term subjective carries in this investigation as th e subjective 
factor then i understand that psychological action or reaction which when merged with the 
effect of the object makes a new psychic fact now in so far as the subjective factor since 
oldest times and among all peoples remains in a very l arge measure identical with itself  since 
elementary perceptions and cognitions are almost universally the same  it is a reality that is just 
as firmly established as the outer object if this were not so any sort of permanent and essentially 
changele ss reality p  would be altogether inconceivable and any understanding with 
posterity would be a matter of impossibility thus far therefore the subjective factor is 
something that is just as much a fact as the extent of the sea and the radius of t he earth thus far 
also the subjective factor claims the whole value of a world determining power which can never 
under any circumstances be excluded from our calculations it is the other world law and the 
man who is based upon it has a foundation ju st as secure permanent and valid as the man who 
relies upon the object but just as the object and objective data remain by no means always the 
same inasmuch as they are both perishable and subject to chance the subjective factor is 
similarly liable t o variability and individual hazard hence its value is also merely relative the 
excessive development of the introverted standpoint in consciousness for instance does not lead 
to a better or sounder application of the subjective factor but to an artif icial subjectification of 
consciousness which can hardly escape the reproach merely subjective for as a 
countertendency to this morbid subjectification there ensues a desubjectification of 
consciousness in the form of an exaggerated extraverted attit ude which richly deserves 
weiningers description misautic inasmuch as the introverted attitude is based upon a 
universally present extremely real and absolutely indispensable condition of psychological 
adaptation such expressions as philautic eg ocentric and the like are both objectionable and 
out of place since they foster the prejudice that it is invariably a question of the beloved ego 
nothing could be more absurd than such an assumption yet one is continually meeting it when

examining the  judgments of the extravert upon the introvert not of course that i wish to ascribe 
such an error to individual extraverts it is rather the present generally accepted extraverted view 
which is by no means restricted to the extraverted p  type fo r it finds just as many 
representatives in the ranks of the other type albeit very much against its own interest the 
reproach of being untrue to his own kind is justly levelled at the latter whereas this at least can 
never be charged against the form er  
the introverted attitude is normally governed by the psychological structure theoretically 
determined by heredity but which to the subject is an ever present subjective factor this must 
not be assumed however to be simply identical with the subje cts ego an assumption that is 
certainly implied in the above mentioned designations of weininger it is rather the 
psychological structure of the subject that precedes any development of the ego the really 
fundamental subject the self is far more comp rehensive than the ego because the former also 
embraces the unconscious while the latter is essentially the focal point of consciousness were 
the ego identical with the self it would be unthinkable that we should be able to appear in 
dreams in entirely  different forms and with entirely different meanings but it is a characteristic 
peculiarity of the introvert which moreover is as much in keeping with his own inclination as 
with the general bias that he tends to confuse his ego with the self and to  exalt his ego to the 
position of subject of the psychological process thus effecting that morbid subjectification of 
consciousness mentioned above which so alienates him from the object  
the psychological structure is the same semon has termed it mn eme  whereas i call it the 
collective unconscious the individual self is a portion or excerpt or representative of 
something universally present in all living creatures and th erefore a correspondingly graduated 
kind of psychological process which is born anew in every creature since earliest times the 
inborn manner of acting p  has been called instinct and for this manner of psychic 
apprehension of the object i have proposed the term archetype i may assume that what is 
understood by instinct is familiar to everyone it is another matter with the archetype this term 
embraces the same idea as is contained in primordial image an expression borrowed from 
jakob burckh ardt and as such i have described it in chapter xi of this book i must here refer 
the reader to that chapter in particular to the definition of image  
the archetype is a symbolical formula which always begins to function whenever there are no 
consc ious ideas present or when such as are present are impossible upon intrinsic or extrinsic 
grounds the contents of the collective unconscious are represented in consciousness in the form 
of pronounced tendencies or definite ways of looking at things the y are generally regarded by 
the individual as being determined by the object incorrectly at bottom since they have their 
source in the unconscious structure of the psyche and are only released by the operation of the 
object these subjective tendencies a nd ideas are stronger than the objective influence because 
their psychic value is higher they are superimposed upon all impressions thus just as it seems 
incomprehensible to the introvert that the object should always be decisive it remains just as 
enigmatic to the extravert how a subjective standpoint can be superior to the objective situation 
he reaches the unavoidable conclusion that the introvert is either a conceited egoist or a fantastic 
doctrinaire recently he seems to have reached the conclus ion that the introvert is constantly 
influenced by an unconscious power complex the introvert unquestionably exposes himself to 
this prejudice for it cannot be denied that his definite and highly generalized mode of 
psychological types

expression which apparently excludes every other view from the outset lends a certain 
countenance to p  this extraverted opinion furthermore the very decisiveness and 
inflexibility of the subjective judgment which is superordinated to all objective data is alone 
sufficient to creat e the impression of a strong egocentricity the introvert usually lacks the right 
argument in presence of this prejudice for he is just as unaware of the unconscious though 
thoroughly sound presuppositions of his subjective judgment as he is of his subj ective 
perceptions in harmony with the style of the times he looks without instead of behind his own 
consciousness for the answer should he become neurotic it is the sign of a more or less 
complete unconscious identity of the ego with the self whereu pon the importance of the self is 
reduced to nil while the ego becomes inflated beyond reason the undeniable world 
determining power of the subjective factor then becomes concentrated in the ego developing an 
immoderate power claim and a downright fool ish egocentricity every psychology which reduces 
the nature of man to unconscious power instinct springs from this foundation for example 
nietzsches many faults in taste owe their existence to this subjectification of consciousness  
ii the unconscio us attitude  
the superior position of the subjective factor in consciousness involves an inferiority of the 
objective factor the object is not given that importance which should really belong to it just as 
it plays too great a role in the extraverted atti tude it has too little to say in the introverted to the 
extent that the introverts consciousness is subjectified thus bestowing undue importance upon 
the ego the object is placed in a position which in time becomes quite untenable the object is a 
factor of undeniable power while the ego is something very restricted p  and transitory it 
would be a very different matter if the self opposed the object self and world are 
commensurable factors hence a normal introverted attitude is just as valid  and has as good a 
right to existence as a normal extraverted attitude but if the ego has usurped the claims of the 
subject a compensation naturally develops under the guise of an unconscious reinforcement of 
the influence of the object such a change eventually commands attention for often in spite of a 
positively convulsive attempt to ensure the superiority of the ego the object and objective data 
develop an overwhelming influence which is all the more invincible because it seizes upon the 
individ ual unawares thus effecting an irresistible invasion of consciousness as a result of the 
egos defective relation to the object  for a will to command is not adaptation  a compensatory 
relation to the object develops in the unconscious which makes i tself felt in consciousness as an 
unconditional and irrepressible tie to the object the more the ego seeks to secure every possible 
liberty independence superiority and freedom from obligations the deeper does it fall into the 
slavery of objective fac ts the subjects freedom of mind is chained to an ignominious financial 
dependence his unconcernedness of action suffers now and again a distressing collapse in the 
face of public opinion his moral superiority gets swamped in inferior relationships an d his 
desire to dominate ends in a pitiful craving to be loved the chief concern of the unconscious in 
such a case is the relation to the object and it affects this in a way that is calculated to bring both 
the power illusion and the superiority phantasy  to utter ruin the object assumes terrifying 
dimensions in spite of conscious depreciation detachment from and command of the object 
are in consequence pursued by the ego still more violently finally the ego surrounds itself by a 
regular system of  safeguards adler has ably p  depicted these which shall at least 
preserve the illusion of superiority but therewith the introvert severs himself completely from 
the object and either squanders his energy in defensive measures or makes fruitles s attempts to 
psychological types

impose his power upon the object and successfully assert himself but these efforts are 
constantly being frustrated by the overwhelming impressions he receives from the object it 
continually imposes itself upon him against his will it provo kes in him the most disagreeable 
and obstinate affects persecuting him at every step an immense inner struggle is constantly 
required of him in order to keep going hence psychoasthenia is his typical form of neurosis a 
malady which is characterized  on the one hand by an extreme sensitiveness and on the other by 
a great liability to exhaustion and chronic fatigue  
an analysis of the personal unconscious yields an abundance of power phantasies coupled with 
fear of the dangerously animated objects t o which as a matter of fact the introvert easily falls a 
victim for a peculiar cowardliness develops from this fear of the object he shrinks from making 
either himself or his opinion effective always dreading an intensified influence on the part of th e 
object he is terrified of impressive affects in others and is hardly ever free from the dread of 
falling under hostile influence for objects possess terrifying and powerful qualities for him 
qualities which he cannot consciously discern in them but w hich through his unconscious 
perception he cannot choose but believe in since his conscious relation to the object is 
relatively repressed its exit is by way of the unconscious where it becomes loaded with the 
qualities of the unconscious these quali ties are primarily infantile and archaic his relation to 
the object therefore becomes correspondingly primitive taking on all those peculiarities which 
characterize the primitive objectrelationship now it seems as though objects possessed p  
magical powers strange new objects excite fear and distrust as though concealing unknown 
dangers objects long rooted and blessed by tradition are attached to his soul as by invisible 
threads every change has a disturbing if not actually dangerous aspect  since its apparent 
implication is a magical animation of the object a lonely island where only what is permitted to 
move moves becomes an ideal auch einer the novel by f th vischer gives a rich insight into 
this side of the introverts psychology  and at the same time shows the underlying symbolism of 
the collective unconscious which in this description of types i am leaving on one side since it is 
a universal phenomenon with no especial connection with types  
iii peculiarities of the basic ps ychological functions in the 
introverted attitude   
 thinking  
when describing extraverted thinking i gave a brief characterization of introverted thinking to 
which at this stage i must make further reference introverted thinking is primarily orientated  by 
the subjective factor at the least this subjective factor is represented by a subjective feeling of 
direction which in the last resort determines judgment occasionally it is a more or less 
finished image which to some extent serves as a standa rd this thinking may be conceived 
either with concrete or with abstract factors but always at the decisive points it is orientated by 
subjective data hence it does not lead from concrete experience back again into objective 
things but always to the su bjective content external facts are not the aim and origin of this 
thinking although the introvert would often like to make it so appear it begins in the subject 
and returns to the subject although it may p  undertake the widest flights into the  territory 
of the real and the actual hence in the statement of new facts its chief value is indirect because 
new views rather than the perception of new facts are its main concern it formulates questions 
psychological types

and creates theories it opens up prospects an d yields insight but in the presence of facts it 
exhibits a reserved demeanour as illustrative examples they have their value but they must not 
prevail facts are collected as evidence or examples for a theory but never for their own sake 
should this latter ever occur it is done only as a compliment to the extraverted style for this 
kind of thinking facts are of secondary importance what apparently is of absolutely paramount 
importance is the development and presentation of the subjective idea th at primordial 
symbolical image standing more or less darkly before the inner vision its aim therefore is never 
concerned with an intellectual reconstruction of concrete actuality but with the shaping of that 
dim image into a resplendent idea its desir e is to reach reality its goal is to see how external 
facts fit into and fulfil the framework of the idea its actual creative power is proved by the fact 
that this thinking can also create that idea which though not present in the external facts is y et 
the most suitable abstract expression of them its task is accomplished when the idea it has 
fashioned seems to emerge so inevitably from the external facts that they actually prove its 
validity  
but just as little as it is given to extraverted thinki ng to wrest a really sound inductive idea from 
concrete facts or ever to create new ones does it lie in the power of introverted thinking to 
translate its original image into an idea adequately adapted to the facts for as in the former case 
the purely e mpirical heaping together of facts paralyses thought and smothers their meaning so 
in the latter case introverted thinking shows a dangerous tendency p  to coerce facts into 
the shape of its image or by ignoring them altogether to unfold its phant asy image in freedom 
in such a case it will be impossible for the presented idea to deny its origin from the dim archaic 
image there will cling to it a certain mythological character that we are prone to interpret as 
originality or in more pronounced  cases as mere whimsicality since its archaic character is not 
transparent as such to specialists unfamiliar with mythological motives the subjective force of 
conviction inherent in such an idea is usually very great its power too is the more convincin g 
the less it is influenced by contact with outer facts although to the man who advocates the idea 
it may well seem that his scanty store of facts were the actual ground and source of the truth and 
validity of his idea yet such is not the case for the  idea derives its convincing power from its 
unconscious archetype which as such has universal validity and everlasting truth its truth 
however is so universal and symbolic that it must first enter into the recognized and 
recognizable knowledge of th e time before it can become a practical truth of any real value to 
life what sort of a causality would it be for instance that never became perceptible in practical 
causes and practical results  
this thinking easily loses itself in the immense truth o f the subjective factor it creates theories 
for the sake of theories apparently with a view to real or at least possible facts yet always with a 
distinct tendency to go over from the world of ideas into mere imagery accordingly many 
intuitions of possi bilities appear on the scene none of which however achieve any reality until 
finally images are produced which no longer express anything externally real being merely 
symbols of the simply unknowable it is now merely a mystical thinking and quite as unfruitful 
as that empirical thinking whose sole operation is within the framework of objective facts p 
  
whereas the latter sinks to the level of a mere presentation of facts the former evaporates into a 
representation of the unknowable which is even beyond everything that could be expressed in an 
psychological types  
get any book for free on   wwwabikacom  
image the presentation of facts has a certain incontestable truth because the subjective factor is 
excluded and the facts speak for themselves similarly the representing of the unknowable has 
also an  immediate subjective and convincing power because it is demonstrable from its own 
existence the former says est ergo est it is  therefore it is  while the latter says cogito 
ergo cogito  i think  therefore i think in the last analysi s introverted thinking arrives at the 
evidence of its own subjective being while extraverted thinking is driven to the evidence of its 
complete identity with the objective fact for while the extravert really denies himself in his 
complete dispersion am ong objects the introvert by ridding himself of each and every content 
has to content himself with his mere existence in both cases the further development of life is 
crowded out of the domain of thought into the region of other psychic functions which  had 
hitherto existed in relative unconsciousness the extraordinary impoverishment of introverted 
thinking in relation to objective facts finds compensation in an abundance of unconscious facts 
whenever consciousness wedded to the function of thought c onfines itself within the smallest 
and emptiest circle possible  though seeming to contain the plenitude of divinity  unconscious 
phantasy becomes proportionately enriched by a multitude of archaically formed facts a 
veritable pandemonium of magical a nd irrational factors wearing the particular aspect that 
accords with the nature of that function which shall next relieve the thought function as the 
representative of life if this should be the intuitive function the other side will be viewed with 
the eyes of a kubin or a meyrink if it is the feeling function p  there arise quite unheard 
of and fantastic feeling relations coupled with feeling judgments of a quite contradictory and 
unintelligible character if the sensation function then the  senses discover some new and never 
before experienced possibility both within and without the body a closer investigation of such 
changes can easily demonstrate the reappearance of primitive psychology with all its 
characteristic features naturally th e thing experienced is not merely primitive but also 
symbolic in fact the older and more primeval it appears the more does it represent the future 
truth since everything ancient in our unconscious means the coming possibility  
under ordinary circumsta nces not even the transition to the other side succeeds  still less the 
redeeming journey through the unconscious the passage across is chiefly prevented by 
conscious resistance to any subjection of the ego to the unconscious reality and to the 
deter mining reality of the unconscious object the condition is a dissociation in other words a 
neurosis having the character of an inner wastage with increasing brain exhaustion  a 
psychoasthenia in fact  
 the introverted thinking type  
just as darwin mi ght possibly represent the normal extraverted thinking type so we might point 
to kant as a counter example of the normal introverted thinking type the former speaks with 
facts the latter appeals to the subjective factor darwin ranges over the wide fiel ds of objective 
facts while kant restricts himself to a critique of knowledge in general but suppose a cuvier be 
contrasted with a nietzsche the antithesis becomes even sharper  
the introverted thinking type is characterized by a priority of the thinki ng i have just described 
like his p  extraverted parallel he is decisively influenced by ideas these however have 
their origin not in the objective data but in the subjective foundation like the extravert he too 
will follow his ideas but in the reverse direction inwardly not outwardly intensity is his aim

not extensity in these fundamental characters he differs markedly indeed quite unmistakably 
from his extraverted parallel like every introverted type he is almost completely lacking i n that 
which distinguishes his counter type namely the intensive relatedness to the object in the case 
of a human object the man has a distinct feeling that he matters only in a negative way ie in 
milder instances he is merely conscious of being su perfluous but with a more extreme type he 
feels himself warded off as something definitely disturbing this negative relation to the object 
indifference and even aversion characterizes every introvert it also makes a description of the 
introverted type in general extremely difficult with him everything tends to disappear and get 
concealed his judgment appears cold obstinate arbitrary and inconsiderate simply because he 
is related less to the object than the subject one can feel nothing in it that  might possibly confer 
a higher value upon the object it always seems to go beyond the object leaving behind it a 
flavour of a certain subjective superiority courtesy amiability and friendliness may be present 
but often with a particular quality sugg esting a certain uneasiness which betrays an ulterior aim 
namely the disarming of an opponent who must at all costs be pacified and set at ease lest he 
prove a disturbing  element in no sense of course is he an opponent but if at all sensitive he  
will feel somewhat repelled perhaps even depreciated invariably the object has to submit to a 
certain neglect in worse cases it is even surrounded with quite unnecessary measures of 
precaution thus it happens that this type tends to p   
disappea r behind a cloud of misunderstanding which only thickens the more he attempts to 
assume by way of compensation and with the help of his inferior functions a certain mask of 
urbanity which often presents a most vivid contrast to his real nature althoug h in the extension 
of his world of ideas he shrinks from no risk however daring and never even considers the 
possibility that such a world might also be dangerous revolutionary heretical and wounding to 
feeling he is none the less a prey to the livel iest anxiety should it ever chance to become 
objectively real that goes against the grain when the time comes for him to transplant his ideas 
into the world his is by no means the air of an anxious mother solicitous for her childrens 
welfare he merel y exposes them and is often extremely annoyed when they fail to thrive on 
their own account the decided lack he usually displays in practical ability and his aversion 
from any sort of reaccentclame assist in this attitude if to his eyes his product a ppears 
subjectively correct and true it must also be so in practice and others have simply got to bow to 
its truth hardly ever will he go out of his way to win anyones appreciation of it especially if it 
be anyone of influence and when he brings him self to do so he is usually so extremely 
maladroit that he merely achieves the opposite of his purpose in his own special province there 
are usually awkward experiences with his colleagues since he never knows how to win their 
favour as a rule he only  succeeds in showing them how entirely superfluous they are to him in 
the pursuit of his ideas he is generally stubborn head strong and quite unamenable to influence 
his suggestibility to personal influences is in strange contrast to this an object ha s only to be 
recognized as apparently innocuous for such a type to become extremely accessible to really 
inferior elements they lay hold of him from the p  unconscious he lets himself be 
brutalized and exploited in the most ignominious way if only  he can be left undisturbed in the 
pursuit of his ideas he simply does not see when he is being plundered behind his back and 
wronged in practical ways this is because his relation to the object is such a secondary matter 
that lie is left without a guide  in the purely objective valuation of his product in thinking out his 
problems to the utmost of his ability he also complicates them and constantly becomes 
entangled in every possible scruple however clear to himself the inner structure of his thoughts

may be he is not in the least clear where and how they link up with the world of reality only 
with difficulty can he persuade himself to admit that what is clear to him may not be equally 
clear to everyone his style is usually loaded and complicated by  all sorts of accessories 
qualifications saving clauses doubts etc which spring from his exacting scrupulousness his 
work goes slowly and with difficulty either he is taciturn or he falls among people who cannot 
understand him whereupon he proceed s to gather further proof of the unfathomable stupidity of 
man if he should ever chance to be understood he is credulously liable to overestimate 
ambitious women have only to understand how advantage may be taken of his uncritical attitude 
towards the o bject to make an easy prey of him or he may develop into a misanthropic bachelor 
with a childlike heart then too his outward appearance is often gauche as if he were painfully 
anxious to escape observation or he may show a remarkable unconcern an al most childlike 
naivete in his own particular field of work he provokes violent contradiction with which he has 
no notion how to deal unless by chance he is seduced by his primitive affects into biting and 
fruitless polemics by his wider circle he is co unted inconsiderate and domineering but the p 
 better one knows him the more favourable ones judgment becomes and his nearest friends 
are well aware how to value his intimacy to people who judge him from afar he appears 
prickly inaccessible ha ughty frequently he may even seem soured as a result of his anti social 
prejudices he has little influence as a personal teacher since the mentality of his pupils is 
strange to him besides teaching has at bottom little interest for him except when it 
accidentally provides him with a theoretical problem he is a poor teacher because while 
teaching his thought is engaged with the actual material and will not be satisfied with its mere 
presentation  
with the intensification of his type his convicti ons become all the more rigid and unbending 
foreign influences are eliminated he becomes more unsympathetic to his peripheral world and 
therefore more dependent upon his intimates his expression becomes more personal and 
inconsiderate and his ideas mor e profound but they can no longer be adequately expressed in the 
material at hand this lack is replaced by emotivity and susceptibility the foreign influence 
brusquely declined from without reaches him from within from the side of the unconscious an d 
he is obliged to collect evidence against it and against things in general which to outsiders seems 
quite superfluous through the subjectification of consciousness occasioned by his defective 
relationship to the object what secretly concerns his own person now seems to him of chief 
importance and he begins to confound his subjective truth with his own person not that he will 
attempt to press anyone personally with his convictions but he will break out with venomous 
and personal retorts against every criticism however just thus in every respect his isolation 
gradually increases his originally fertilizing ideas become destructive because poisoned by a 
kind of sediment of bitterness his struggle against the influences emanating p  from the 
unconscious increases with his external isolation until gradually this begins to cripple him a 
still greater isolation must surely protect him from the unconscious influences but as a rule this 
only takes him deeper into the conflict which is destroying hi m within  
the thinking of the introverted type is positive and synthetic in the development of those ideas 
which in ever increasing measure approach the eternal validity of the primordial images but 
when their connection with objective experience begins  to fade they become mythological and 
untrue for the present situation hence this thinking holds value only for its contemporaries just 
so long as it also stands in visible and understandable connection with the known facts of the

time but when thinki ng becomes mythological its irrelevancy grows until finally it gets lost in 
itself the relatively unconscious functions of feeling intuition and sensation which 
counterbalance introverted thinking are inferior in quality and have a primitive extrave rted 
character to which all the troublesome objective influences this type is subject to must be 
ascribed the various measures of self defence the curious protective obstacles with which such 
people are wont to surround themselves are sufficiently fami liar and i may therefore spare 
myself a description of them they all serve as a defence against magical influences a vague 
dread of the other sex also belongs to this category  
 feeling  
introverted feeling is determined principally by the subject ive factor this means that the feeling 
judgment differs quite as essentially from extraverted feeling as does the introversion of thinking 
from extraversion it is unquestionably difficult to give an intellectual presentation of the 
introverted feeling pr ocess or even an approximate p  description of it although the 
peculiar character of this kind of feeling simply stands out as soon as one becomes aware of it at 
all since it is primarily controlled by subjective preconditions and is only seconda rily 
concerned with the object this feeling appears much less upon the surface and is as a rule 
misunderstood it is a feeling which apparently depreciates the object hence it usually becomes 
noticeable in its negative manifestations the existence of a positive feeling can be inferred only 
indirectly as it were its aim is not so much to accommodate to the objective fact as to stand 
above it since its whole unconscious effort is to give reality to the underlying images it is as it 
were continually  seeking an image which has no existence in reality but of which it has had a 
sort of previous vision from objects that can never fit in with its aim it seems to glide 
unheedingly away it strives after an inner intensity to which at the most objects c ontribute only 
an accessory stimulus the depths of this feeling can only be divined  they can never be clearly 
comprehended it makes men silent and difficult of access with the sensitiveness of the mimosa 
it shrinks from the brutality of the object in order to expand into the depths of the subject it puts 
forward negative feeling judgments or assumes an air of profound indifference as a measure of 
selfdefence  
primordial images are of course just as much idea as feeling thus basic ideas such as god 
freedom immortality are just as much feeling values as they are significant as ideas everything 
therefore that has been said of the introverted thinking refers equally to introverted feeling only 
here everything is felt while there it was thou ght but the fact that thoughts can generally be 
expressed more intelligibly than feelings demands a more than ordinary descriptive or artistic 
capacity before the real wealth of this feeling can be even approximately p  presented or 
communicated to the outer world whereas subjective thinking on account of its unrelatedness 
finds great difficulty in arousing an adequate understanding the same though in perhaps even 
higher degree holds good for subjective feeling in order to communicate with oth ers it has to 
find an external form which is not only fitted to absorb the subjective feeling in a satisfying 
expression but which must also convey it to ones fellowman in such a way that a parallel 
process takes place in him thanks to the relatively gr eat internal as well as external similarity 
of the human being this effect can actually be achieved although a form acceptable to feeling is 
extremely difficult to find so long as it is still mainly orientated by the fathomless store of 
primordial ima ges but when it becomes falsified by an egocentric attitude it at once grows 
psychological types

unsympathetic since then its major concern is still with the ego such a case never fails to create 
an impression of sentimental self love with its constant effort to arouse interest and even morbid 
selfadmiration just as the subjectified consciousness of the introverted thinker striving after an 
abstraction of abstractions only attains a supreme intensity of a thought process in itself quite 
empty so the intensification o f egocentric feeling only leads to a contentless passionateness 
which merely feels itself this is the mystical ecstatic stage which prepares the way over into 
the extraverted functions repressed by feeling just as introverted thinking is pitted agains t a 
primitive feeling to which objects attach themselves with magical force so introverted feeling is 
counterbalanced by a primitive thinking whose concretism and slavery to facts passes all 
bounds continually emancipating itself from the relation to t he object this feeling creates a 
freedom both of action and of conscience that is only answerable to the subject and that may 
even renounce all traditional values but so much the more p  does unconscious thinking 
fall a victim to the power of ob jective facts  
 the introverted feeling type  
it is principally among women that i have found the priority of introverted feeling the proverb 
still waters run deep is very true of such women they are mostly silent inaccessible and hard 
to understan d often they hide behind a childish or banal mask and not infrequently their 
temperament is melancholic they neither shine nor reveal themselves since they submit the 
control of their lives to their subjectively orientated feeling their true motives g enerally remain 
concealed their outward demeanour is harmonious and inconspicuous they reveal a delightful 
repose a sympathetic parallelism which has no desire to affect others either to impress 
influence or change them in any way should this outer  side be somewhat emphasized a 
suspicion of neglectfulness and coldness may easily obtrude itself which not seldom increases to 
a real indifference for the comfort and well being of others one distinctly feels the movement of 
feeling away from the objec t with the normal type however such an event only occurs when 
the object has in some way too strong an effect the harmonious feeling atmosphere rules only 
so long as the object moves upon its own way with a moderate feeling intensity and makes no 
attempt to cross the others path there is little effort to accompany the real emotions of the 
object which tend to be damped and rebuffed or to put it more aptly are cooled off by a 
negative feeling judgment although one may find a constant readiness f or a peaceful and 
harmonious companionship the unfamiliar object is shown no touch of amiability no gleam of 
responding warmth but is met by a manner of apparent indifference or repelling coldness p 
  
one may even be made to feel the superfluousn ess of ones own existence in the presence of 
something that might carry one away or arouse enthusiasm this type observes a benevolent 
neutrality tempered with an occasional trace of superiority and criticism that soon takes the wind 
out of the sails of  a sensitive object but a stormy emotion will be brusquely rejected with 
murderous coldness unless it happens to catch the subject from the side of the unconscious ie 
unless through the animation of some primordial image feeling is as it were take n captive in 
which event such a woman simply feels a momentary laming invariably producing in due 
course a still more violent resistance which reaches the object in his most vulnerable spot the 
relation to the object is as far as possible kept in a  secure and tranquil middle state of feeling 
where passion and its intemperateness are resolutely proscribed expression of feeling therefore

remains niggardly and when once aware of it at all the object has a permanent sense of his 
undervaluation su ch however is not always the case since very often the deficit remains 
unconscious whereupon the unconscious feeling claims gradually produce symptoms which 
compel a more serious attention  
a superficial judgment might well be betrayed by a rather co ld and reserved demeanour into 
denying all feeling to this type such a view however would be quite false the truth is her 
feelings are intensive rather than extensive they develop into the depth whereas for instance 
an extensive feeling of sympat hy can express itself in both word and deed at the right place thus 
quickly ridding itself of its impression an intensive sympathy because shut off from every 
means of expression gains a passionate depth that embraces the misery of a world and is simpl y 
benumbed it may possibly make an extravagant irruption leading to some staggering act of an 
almost heroic character to which however neither the object nor p  the subject can find a 
right relation to the outer world or to the blind eyes of t he extravert this sympathy looks like 
coldness for it does nothing visibly and an extraverted consciousness is unable to believe in 
invisible forces  
such misunderstanding is a characteristic occurrence in the life of this type and is commonly 
registe red as a most weighty argument against any deeper feeling relation with the object but 
the underlying real object of this feeling is only dimly divined by the normal type it may 
possibly express its aim and content in a concealed religiosity anxiously s hielded from profane 
eyes or in intimate poetic forms equally safeguarded from surprise not without a secret 
ambition to bring about some superiority over the object by such means women often express 
much of it in their children letting their passiona teness flow secretly into them  
although in the normal type the tendency above alluded to to overpower or coerce the object 
once openly and visibly with the thing secretly felt rarely plays a disturbing role and never leads 
to a serious attempt in th is direction some trace of it none the less leaks through into the 
personal effect upon the object in the form of a domineering influence often difficult to define it 
is sensed as a sort of stifling or oppressive feeling which holds the immediate circ le under a 
spell it gives a woman of this type a certain mysterious power that may prove terribly 
fascinating to the extraverted man for it touches his unconscious this power is derived from the 
deeply felt unconscious images consciousness however r eadily refers it to the ego whereupon 
the influence becomes debased into personal tyranny but wherever the unconscious subject is 
identified with the ego the mysterious power of the intensive feeling is also transformed into 
banal and arrogant ambition  vanity and p  petty tyranny this produces a type of woman 
most regrettably distinguished by her unscrupulous ambition and mischievous cruelty but this 
change in the picture leads also to neurosis  
so long as the ego feels itself housed as it w ere beneath the heights of the unconscious subject 
and feeling reveals something higher and mightier than the ego the type is normal the 
unconscious thinking is certainly archaic yet its reductions may prove extremely helpful in 
compensating the occas ional inclinations to exalt the ego into the subject but whenever this 
does take place by dint of complete suppression of the unconscious reductive thinking products 
the unconscious thinking goes over into opposition and becomes projected into objects 
whereupon the now egocentric subject comes to feel the power and importance of the

depreciated object consciousness begins to feel what others think naturally others are 
thinking all sorts of baseness scheming evil and contriving all sorts of plots  secret intrigues 
etc to prevent this the subject must also begin to carry out preventive intrigues to suspect and 
sound others to make subtle combinations assailed by rumours he must make convulsive 
efforts to convert if possible a threatened in feriority into a superiority innumerable secret 
rivalries develop and in these embittered struggles not only will no base or evil means be 
disdained but even virtues will be misused and tampered with in order to play the trump card 
such a development m ust lead to exhaustion the form of neurosis is neurasthenic rather than 
hysterical in the case of women we often find severe collateral physical states as for instance

 recapitulation of introverted rational types  
both the for egoing types are rational since they are founded upon reasoning judging functions 
reasoning p  judgment is based not merely upon objective but also upon subjective data 
but the predominance of one or other factor conditioned by a psychic dispo sition often existing 
from early youth deflects the reasoning function for a judgment to be really reasonable it 
should have equal reference to both the objective and the subjective factors and be able to do 
justice to both this however would be an i deal case and would presuppose a uniform 
development of both extraversion and introversion but either movement excludes the other and 
so long as this dilemma persists they cannot possibly exist side by side but at the most 
successively under ordina ry circumstances therefore an ideal reason is impossible a rational 
type has always a typical reasonal variation thus the introverted rational types unquestionably 
have a reasoning judgment only it is a judgment whose leading note is subjective the laws of 
logic are not necessarily deflected since its onesidedness lies in the premise the premise is the 
predominance of the subjective factor existing beneath every conclusion and colouring every 
judgment its superior value as compared with the object ive factor is self evident from the 
beginning as already stated it is not just a question of value bestowed but of a natural 
disposition existing before all rational valuation hence to the introvert rational judgment 
necessarily appears to have many n uances which differentiate it from that of the extravert thus 
to the introvert to mention the most general instance that chain of reasoning which leads to the 
subjective factor appears rather more reasonable than that which leads to the object this 
difference which in the individual case is practically insignificant indeed almost unnoticeable 
effects unbridgeable oppositions in the gross these are the more irritating the less we are aware 
of the minimal standpoint displacement produced by the psyc hological premise in the individual 
case a p  capital error regularly creeps in here for one labours to prove a fallacy in the 
conclusion instead of realizing the difference of the psychological premise such a realization is 
a difficult matter fo r every rational type since it undermines the apparent absolute validity of his 
own principle and delivers him over to its antithesis which certainly amounts to a catastrophe  
almost more even than the extraverted is the introverted type subject to mi sunderstanding not so 
much because the extravert is a more merciless or critical adversary than he himself can easily 
be but because the style of the epoch in which he himself participates is against him not in 
relation to the extraverted type but as against our general accidental world philosophy he finds 
himself in the minority not of course numerically but from the evidence of his own feeling in 
so far as he is a convinced participator in the general style he undermines his own foundations 
psychological types

since the present style with its almost exclusive acknowledgment of the visible and the tangible 
is opposed to his principle because of its invisibility he is obliged to depreciate the subjective 
factor and to force himself to join in the extraverted ove rvaluation of the object he himself sets 
the subjective factor at too low a value and his feelings of inferiority are his chastisement for 
this sin little wonder therefore that it is precisely our epoch and particularly those movements 
which are some what ahead of the time that reveal the subjective factor in every kind of 
exaggerated crude and grotesque form of expression i refer to the art of the present day  
the undervaluation of his own principle makes the introvert egotistical and forces upon  him the 
psychology of the oppressed the more egotistical he becomes the stronger his impression 
grows that these others who are apparently able without qualms to conform with the present 
style are the oppressors against whom he must guard and p   protect himself he does not 
usually perceive that he commits his capital mistake in not depending upon the subjective factor 
with that same loyalty and devotion with which the extravert follows the object by the 
undervaluation of his own principle his  penchant towards egoism becomes unavoidable which 
of course richly deserves the prejudice of the extravert were he only to remain true to his own 
principle the judment of egoist would be radically false for the justification of his attitude 
would be established by its general efficacy and all misunderstandings dissipated  
 sensation  
sensation which in obedience to its whole nature is concerned with the object and the objective 
stimulus also undergoes a considerable modification in the introve rted attitude it too has a 
subjective factor for beside the object sensed there stands a sensing subject who contributes his 
subjective disposition to the objective stimulus in the introverted attitude sensation is definitely 
based upon the subjectiv e portion of perception what is meant by this finds its best illustration 
in the reproduction of objects in art when for instance several painters undertake to paint one 
and the same landscape with a sincere attempt to reproduce it faithfully each pa inting will none 
the less differ from the rest not merely by virtue of a more or less developed ability but chiefly 
because of a different vision there will even appear in some of the paintings a decided psychic 
variation both in general mood and in tr eatment of colour and form such qualities betray a more 
or less influential co operation of the subjective factor the subjective factor of sensation is 
essentially the same as in the other functions already spoken of it is an unconscious disposition 
which alters p  the sense perception at its very source thus depriving it of the character of 
a purely objective influence in this case sensation is related primarily to the subject and only 
secondarily to the object how extraordinarily strong the  subjective factor can be is shown most 
clearly in art the ascendancy of the subjective factor occasionally achieves a complete 
suppression of the mere influence of the object but none the less sensation remains sensation 
although it has come to be a pe rception of the subjective factor and the effect of the object has 
sunk to the level of a mere stimulant introverted sensation develops in accordance with this 
subjective direction a true sense perception certainly exists but it always looks as though 
objects were not so much forcing their way into the subject in their own right as that the subject 
were seeing things quite differently or saw quite other things than the rest of mankind as a 
matter of fact the subject perceives the same things as every body else only he never stops at the 
purely objective effect but concerns himself with the subjective perception released by the 
objective stimulus subjective perception differs remarkably from the objective it is either not

found at all in the object  or at most merely suggested by it it can however be similar to the 
sensation of other men although not immediately derived from the objective behaviour of things 
it does not impress one as a mere product of consciousness  it is too genuine for t hat but it 
makes a definite psychic impression since elements of a higher psychic order are perceptible to 
it this order however does not coincide with the contents of consciousness it is concerned 
with presuppositions or dispositions of the collect ive unconscious with mythological images 
with primal possibilities of ideas the character of significance and meaning clings to subjective 
perception it says more than the mere image of the object though naturally only to him for 
whom the p  sub jective factor has some meaning to another a reproduced subjective 
impression seems to suffer from the defect of possessing insufficient similarity with the object it 
seems therefore to have failed in its purpose subjective sensation apprehends the b ackground 
of the physical world rather than its surface the decisive thing is not the reality of the object but 
the reality of the subjective factor ie the primordial images which in their totality represent a 
psychic mirror world it is a mirror ho wever with the peculiar capacity of representing the 
present contents of consciousness not in their known and customary form but in a certain sense 
sub specie aeternitatis somewhat as a million year old consciousness might see them such a 
consciousness would see the becoming and the passing of things beside their present and 
momentary existence and not only that but at the same time it would also see that other which 
was before their becoming and will be after their passing hence to this consciousnes s the 
present moment is improbable this is of course only a simile of which however i had need to 
give some sort of illustration of the peculiar nature of introverted sensation introverted sensation 
conveys an image whose effect is not so much to re produce the object as to throw over it a 
wrapping whose lustre is derived from age old subjective experience and the still unborn future 
event thus mere sense impression develops into the depth of the meaningful while extraverted 
sensation seizes only t he momentary and manifest existence of things  
 the introverted sensation type  
the priority of introverted sensation produces a definite type which is characterized by certain 
peculiarities it is an irrational type inasmuch as its selection among occ urrences is not primarily 
rational but is guided rather p  by what just happens whereas the extraverted sensation 
type is determined by the intensity of the objective influence the introverted type is orientated by 
the intensity of the subjective  sensation constituent released by the objective stimulus 
obviously therefore no sort of proportional relation exists between object and sensation but 
something that is apparently quite irregular and arbitrary judging from without therefore it is 
practically impossible to foretell what will make an impression and what will not if there were 
present a capacity and readiness for expression in any way commensurate with the strength of 
sensation the irrationality of this type would be extremely evident  this is the case for instance 
when the individual is a creative artist but since this is the exception it usually happens that the 
characteristic introverted difficulty of expression also conceals his irrationality on the contrary 
he may actually s tand out by the very calmness and passivity of his demeanour or by his rational 
selfcontrol this peculiarity which often leads the superficial judgment astray is really due to 
his unrelatedness to objects normally the object is not consciously deprec iated in the least but 
its stimulus is removed from it because it is immediately replaced by a subjective reaction 
which is no longer related to the reality of the object this of course has the same effect as a 
depreciation of the object such a type  can easily make one question why one should exist at all 
psychological types

or why objects in general should have any right to existence since everything essential happens 
without the object this doubt may be justified in extreme cases though not in the normal since 
the objective stimulus is indispensable to his sensation only it produces something different 
from what was to be surmised from the external state of affairs considered from without it 
looks as though the effect of the object p  did not obtrude itse lf upon the subject this 
impression is so far correct inasmuch as a subjective content does in fact intervene from the 
unconscious thus snatching away the effect of the object this intervention may be so abrupt 
that the individual appears to shield hi mself directly from any possible influence of the object in 
any aggravated or well marked case such a protective guard is also actually present even with 
only a slight reinforcement of the unconscious the subjective constituent of sensation becomes 
so alive that it almost completely obscures the objective influence the results of this are on the 
one hand a feeling of complete depreciation on the part of the object and on the other an 
illusory conception of reality on the part of the subject which  in morbid cases may even reach 
the point of a complete inability to discriminate between the real object and the subjective 
perception although so vital a distinction vanishes completely only in a practically psychotic 
state yet long before that point i s reached subjective perception may influence thought feeling 
and action to an extreme degree in spite of the fact that the object is clearly seen in its fullest 
reality whenever the objective influence does succeed in forcing its way into the subject  as 
the result of particular circumstances of special intensity or because of a more perfect analogy 
with the unconscious image  even the normal example of this type is induced to act in 
accordance with his unconscious model such action has an illuso ry quality in relation to 
objective reality and therefore has a very odd and strange character it instantly reveals the anti 
real subjectivity of the type but where the influence of the object does not entirely succeed it 
encounters a benevolent neutr ality disclosing little sympathy yet constantly striving to reassure 
and adjust the too low is raised a little the too high is made a little lower the enthusiastic is 
damped the p  extravagant restrained and the unusual brought within the cor rect formula 
all this in order to keep the influence of the object within the necessary bounds thus this type 
becomes an affliction to his circle just in so far as his entire harmlessness is no longer above 
suspicion but if the latter should be the case the individual readily becomes a victim to the 
aggressiveness and ambitions of others such men allow themselves to be abused for which they 
usually take vengeance at the most unsuitable occasions with redoubled stubbornness and 
resistance when the re exists no capacity for artistic expression all impressions sink into the 
inner depths whence they hold consciousness under a spell removing any possibility it might 
have had of mastering the fascinating impression by means of conscious expression re latively 
speaking this type has only archaic possibilities of expression for the disposal of his 
impressions thought and feeling are relatively unconscious and in so far as they have a certain 
consciousness they only serve in the necessary banal eve ryday expressions hence as 
conscious functions they are wholly unfitted to give any adequate rendering of the subjective 
perceptions this type therefore is uncommonly inaccessible to an objective understanding and 
he fares no better in the understand ing of himself  
above all his development estranges him from the reality of the object handing him over to his 
subjective perceptions which orientate his consciousness in accordance with an archaic reality 
although his deficiency in comparative judgme nt keeps him wholly unaware of this fact 
actually he moves in a mythological world where men animals railways houses rivers and 
mountains appear partly as benevolent deities and partly as malevolent demons that thus they

appear to him never enters his mind although their effect upon his judgments and acts can bear 
no other interpretation he judges and acts as p  though he had such powers to deal with 
but this begins to strike him only when he discovers that his sensations are totally differ ent from 
reality if his tendency is to reason objectively he will sense this difference as morbid but if on 
the other hand he remains faithful to his irrationality and is prepared to grant his sensation 
reality value the objective world will appear a mere make belief and a comedy only in extreme 
cases however is this dilemma reached as a rule the individual acquiesces in his isolation and 
in the banality of the reality which however he unconsciously treats archaically  
his unconscious is dis tinguished chiefly by the repression of intuition which thereby acquires an 
extraverted and archaic character whereas true extraverted intuition has a characteristic 
resourcefulness and a good nose for every possibility in objective reality this arch aic 
extraverted intuition has an amazing flair for every ambiguous gloomy dirty and dangerous 
possibility in the background of reality in the presence of this intuition the real and conscious 
intention of the object has no significance it will peer b ehind every possible archaic antecedent 
of such an intention it possesses therefore something dangerous something actually 
undermining which often stands in most vivid contrast to the gentle benevolence of 
consciousness so long as the individual is n ot too aloof from the object the unconscious 
intuition effects a wholesome compensation to the rather fantastic and over credulous attitude of 
consciousness but as soon as the unconscious becomes antagonistic to consciousness such 
intuitions come to the  surface and expand their nefarious influence they force themselves 
compellingly upon the individual releasing compulsive ideas about objects of the most perverse 
kind the neurosis arising from this sequence of events is usually a compulsion neurosis i n 
which the hysterical characters recede and are obscured by symptoms of exhaustion p   
 intuition  
intuition in the introverted attitude is directed upon the inner object a term we might justly 
apply to the elements of the unconscious for the relation of inner objects to consciousness is 
entirely analogous to that of outer objects although theirs is a psychological and not a physical 
reality inner objects appear to the intuitive perception as subjective images of things which 
though not met  with in external experience really determine the contents of the unconscious ie 
the collective unconscious in the last resort naturally in their per se character these contents 
are not accessible to experience a quality which they have in common  with the outer object for 
just as outer objects correspond only relatively with our perceptions of them so the phenomenal 
forms of the inner object are also relative products of their to us inaccessible essence and of 
the peculiar nature of the intui tive function like sensation intuition also has its subjective 
factor which is suppressed to the farthest limit in the extraverted intuition but which becomes 
the decisive factor in the intuition of the introvert although this intuition may receive it s 
impetus from outer objects it is never arrested by the external possibilities but stays with that 
factor which the outer object releases within  
whereas introverted sensation is mainly confined to the perception of particular innervation 
phenomena by way of the unconscious and does not go beyond them intuition represses this 
side of the subjective factor and perceives the image which has really occasioned the innervation 
supposing for instance a man is overtaken by a psychogenic attack of giddines s sensation is

arrested by the peculiar character of this innervationdisturbance perceiving all its qualities its 
intensity its transient course the nature of its origin and disappearance p  in their every 
detail without raising the smallest in quiry concerning the nature of the thing which produced the 
disturbance or advancing anything as to its content intuition on the other hand receives from 
the sensation only the impetus to immediate activity it peers behind the scenes quickly 
perceivi ng the inner image that gave rise to the specific phenomenon ie the attack of vertigo in 
the present case it sees the image of a tottering man pierced through the heart by an arrow this 
image fascinates the intuitive activity it is arrested by it a nd seeks to explore every detail of it it 
holds fast to the vision observing with the liveliest interest how the picture changes unfolds 
further and finally fades in this way introverted intuition perceives all the background processes 
of consciousnes s with almost the same distinctness as extraverted sensation senses outer objects 
for intuition therefore the unconscious images attain to the dignity of things or objects but 
because intuition excludes the co operation of sensation it obtains either  no knowledge at all or 
at the best a very inadequate awareness of the innervation disturbances or of the physical effects 
produced by the unconscious images accordingly the images appear as though detached from 
the subject as though existing in themsel ves without relation to the person  
consequently in the above mentioned example the introverted intuitive when affected by the 
giddiness would not imagine that the perceived image might also in some way refer to himself 
naturally to one who is ratio nally orientated such a thing seems almost unthinkable but it is 
none the less a fact and i have often experienced it in my dealings with this type  
the remarkable indifference of the extraverted intuitive in respect to outer objects is shared by 
the introverted intuitive in relation to the inner objects just as the extraverted intuitive is 
continually scenting out new p  possibilities which he pursues with an equal unconcern 
both for his own welfare and for that of others pressing on quite hee dless of human 
considerations tearing down what has only just been established in his everlasting search for 
change so the introverted intuitive moves from image to image chasing after every possibility in 
the teeming womb of the unconscious without es tablishing any connection between the 
phenomenon and himself   just as the world can never become a moral problem for the man who 
merely senses it so the world of images is never a moral problem to the intuitive to the one just 
as much as to the other i t is an aesthenic problem a question of perception a sensation in 
this way the consciousness of his own bodily existence fades from the introverted intuitives 
view as does its effect upon others the extraverted standpoint would say of him real ity has no 
existence for him he gives himself up to fruitless phantasies a perception of the unconscious 
images produced in such inexhaustible abundance by the creative energy of life is of course 
fruitless from the standpoint of immediate utility bu t since these images represent possible 
ways of viewing life which in given circumstances have the power to provide a new energic 
potential this function which to the outer world is the strangest of all is as indispensable to the 
total psychic economy  as is the corresponding human type to the psychic life of a people had 
this type not existed there would have been no prophets in israel  
introverted intuition apprehends the images which arise from the a priori ie the inherited 
foundations of the u nconscious mind these archetypes whose innermost nature is inaccessible 
to experience represent the precipitate of psychic functioning of the whole ancestral line ie the 
heaped up or pooled experiences of organic existence in general a million tim es repeated and

condensed into types hence in these archetypes all experiences are p  represented which 
since primeval time have happened on this planet their archetypal distinctness is the more 
marked the more frequently and intensely they have  been experienced the archetype would be 
 to borrow from kant  the noumenon of the image which intuition perceives and in 
perceiving creates  
since the unconscious is not just something that lies there like a psychic caput mortuum but is 
somethin g that coexists and experiences inner transformations which are inherently related to 
general events introverted intuition through its perception of inner processes gives certain data 
which may possess supreme importance for the comprehension of general  occurrences it can 
even foresee new possibilities in more or less clear outline as well as the event which later 
actually transpires its prophetic prevision is to be explained from its relation to the archetypes 
which represent the law determined cours e of all experienceable things  
 the introverted intuitive type  
the peculiar nature of introverted intuition when given the priority also produces a peculiar 
type of man viz the mystical dreamer and seer on the one hand or the fantastical crank and  
artist on the other the latter might be regarded as the normal case since there is a general 
tendency of this type to confine himself to the perceptive character of intuition as a rule the 
intuitive stops at perception perception is his principal pro blem and  in the case of a 
productive artist the shaping of perception but the crank contents himself with the intuition by 
which he himself is shaped and determined intensification of intuition naturally often results in 
an extraordinary aloofness of  the individual from tangible reality he may even become a 
complete enigma to his own immediate circle p   
if an artist he reveals extraordinary remote things in his art which in iridescent profusion 
embrace both the significant and the banal t he lovely and the grotesque the whimsical and the 
sublime if not an artist he is frequently an unappreciated genius a great man gone wrong a 
sort of wise simpleton a figure for psychological novels  
although it is not altogether in the line of t he introverted intuitive type to make of perception a 
moral problem since a certain reinforcement of the rational functions is required for this yet 
even a relatively slight differentiation of judgment would suffice to transfer intuitive perception 
from the purely sthetic into the moral sphere a variety of this type is thus produced which 
differs essentially from its sthetic form although none the less characteristic of the introverted 
intuitive the moral problem comes into being when the intuitive t ries to relate himself to his 
vision when he is no longer satisfied with mere perception and its sthetic shaping and 
estimation but confronts the question what does this mean for me and for the world what 
emerges from this vision in the way of a duty or task either for me or for the world the pure 
intuitive who represses judgment or possesses it only under the spell of perception never meets 
this question fundamentally since his only problem is the how of perception he therefore 
finds the moral p roblem unintelligible even absurd and as far as possible forbids his thoughts to 
dwell upon the disconcerting vision it is different with the morally orientated intuitive he 
concerns himself with the meaning of his vision he troubles less about its fu rther sthetic 
possibilities than about the possible moral effects which emerge from its intrinsic significance

his judgment allows him to discern though often only darkly that he as a man and as a totality 
is in some way inter related with his vision  that p  it is something which cannot just be 
perceived but which also would fain become the life of the subject through this realization he 
feels bound to transform his vision into his own life but since he tends to rely exclusively upon 
his vis ion his moral effort becomes one sided he makes himself and his life symbolic adapted 
it is true to the inner and eternal meaning of events but unadapted to the actual present day 
reality therewith he also deprives himself of any influence upon it because he remains 
unintelligible his language is not that which is commonly spoken  it becomes too subjective 
his argument lacks convincing reason he can only confess or pronounce his is the voice of 
one crying in the wilderness  
the introverted intuitives chief repression falls upon the sensation of the object his unconscious 
is characterized by this fact for we find in his unconscious a compensatory extraverted 
sensation function of an archaic character the unconscious personality may there fore best be 
described as an extraverted sensation type of a rather low and primitive order impulsiveness and 
unrestraint are the characters of this sensation combined with an extraordinary dependence upon 
the sense impression this latter quality is a compensation to the thin upper air of the conscious 
attitude giving it a certain weight so that complete sublimation is prevented but if through a 
forced exaggeration of the conscious attitude a complete subordination to the inner perception 
should develop the unconscious becomes an opposition giving rise to compulsive sensations 
whose excessive dependence upon the object is in frank conflict with the conscious attitude the 
form of neurosis is a compulsion neurosis exhibiting symptoms that are pa rtly hypochondriacal 
manifestations partly hypersensibility of the sense organs and partly compulsive ties to definite 
persons or other objects p   
 recapitulation of introverted irrational types  
the two types just depicted are almost inaccessib le to external judgment because they are 
introverted and have in consequence a somewhat meagre capacity or willingness for expression 
they offer but a frail handle for a telling criticism since their main activity is directed within 
nothing is outwardl y visible but reserve secretiveness lack of sympathy or uncertainty and an 
apparently groundless perplexity when anything does come to the surface it usually consists in 
indirect manifestations of inferior and relatively unconscious functions manife stations of such a 
nature naturally excite a certain environmental prejudice against these types accordingly they 
are mostly underestimated or at least misunderstood to the same degree as they fail to 
understand themselves  because they very largely l ack judgment  they are also powerless to 
understand why they are so constantly undervalued by public opinion they cannot see that their 
outward going expression is as a matter of fact also of an inferior character their vision is 
enchanted by the abu ndance of subjective events what happens there is so captivating and of 
such inexhaustible attraction that they do not appreciate the fact that their habitual 
communications to their circle express very little of that real experience in which they 
themselves are as it were caught up the fragmentary and as a rule quite episodic character of 
their communications make too great a demand upon the understanding and good will of their 
circle furthermore their mode of expression lacks that flowing warmt h to the object which alone 
can have convincing force on the contrary these types show very often a brusque repelling 
demeanour towards the outer world although of this they are quite unaware and have not the

least intention of showing it we shall fo rm a p  fairer judgment of such men and grant 
them a greater indulgence when we begin to realize how hard it is to translate into intelligible 
language what is perceived within yet this indulgence must not be so liberal as to exempt them 
altogether  from the necessity of such expression this could be only detrimental for such types 
fate itself prepares for them perhaps even more than for other men overwhelming external 
difficulties which have a very sobering effect upon the intoxication of the i nner vision but 
frequently only an intense personal need can wring from them a human expression  
from an extraverted and rationalistic standpoint such types are indeed the most fruitless of men 
but viewed from a higher standpoint such men are living evidence of the fact that this rich and 
varied world with its overflowing and intoxicating life is not purely external but also exists 
within these types are admittedly one sided demonstrations of nature but they are an 
educational experience for the ma n who refuses to be blinded by the intellectual mode of the day 
in their own way men with such an attitude are educators and promoters of culture their life 
teaches more than their words from their lives and not the least from what is just their great est 
fault viz their incommunicability we may understand one of the greatest errors of our 
civilization that is the superstitious belief in statement and presentation the immoderate 
overprizing of instruction by means of word and method a child certa inly allows himself to be 
impressed by the grand talk of its parents but is it really imagined that the child is thereby 
educated actually it is the parents lives that educate the child  what they add thereto by word 
and gesture at best serves only to  confuse him the same holds good for the teacher but we have 
such a belief in method that if only the method be good the practice of it seems to hallow the 
teacher an inferior p  man is never a good teacher but he can conceal his injurious 
inferiority which secretly poisons the pupil behind an excellent method or an equally brilliant 
intellectual capacity naturally the pupil of riper years desires nothing better than the knowledge 
of useful methods because he is already defeated by the gen eral attitude which believes in the 
victorious method he has already learnt that the emptiest head correctly echoing a method is 
the best pupil his whole environment not only urges but exemplifies the doctrine that all success 
and happiness are extern al and that only the right method is needed to attain the haven of ones 
desires or is the life of his religious instructor likely to demonstrate that happiness which 
radiates from the treasure of the inner vision the irrational introverted types are ce rtainly no 
instructors of a more complete humanity they lack reason and the ethics of reason but their 
lives teach the other possibility in which our civilization is so deplorably wanting  
 the principal and auxiliary functions  
in the foregoing desc riptions i have no desire to give my readers the impression that such pure 
types occur at all frequently in actual practice the are as it were only galtonesque family 
portraits which sum up in a cumulative image the common and therefore typical charact ers 
stressing these disproportionately while the individual features are just as disproportionately 
effaced accurate investigation of the individual case consistently reveals the fact that in 
conjunction with the most differentiated function another f unction of secondary importance and 
therefore of inferior differentiation in consciousness is constantly present and is a  relatively 
determining factor p

for the sake of clarity let us again recapitulate the products of all the functions ca n be 
conscious but we speak of the consciousness of a function only when not merely its application 
is at the disposal of the will but when at the same time its principle is decisive for the orientation 
of consciousness the latter event is true when fo r instance thinking is not a mere esprit de 
lescalier or rumination but when its decisions possess an absolute validity so that the logical 
conclusion in a given case holds good whether as motive or as guarantee of practical action 
without the backi ng of any further evidence this absolute sovereignty always belongs 
empirically to one function alone and can belong only to one function since the equally 
independent intervention of another function would necessarily yield a different orientation 
which would at least partially contradict the first but since it is a vital condition for the 
conscious adaptation process that constantly clear and unambiguous aims should be in evidence 
the presence of a second function of equivalent power is naturally  forbidden this other function 
therefore can have only a secondary importance a fact which is also established empirically its 
secondary importance consists in the fact that in a given case it is not valid in its own right as is 
the primary functio n as an absolutely reliable and decisive factor but comes into play more as 
an auxiliary or complementary function naturally only those functions can appear as auxiliary 
whose nature is not opposed to the leading function for instance feeling can neve r act as the 
second function by the side of thinking because its nature stands in too strong a contrast to 
thinking thinking if it is to be real thinking and true to its own principle must scrupulously 
exclude feeling this of course does not exclude  the fact that individuals certainly exist in 
whom thinking and feeling stand upon the same p  level whereby both have equal motive 
power in consdousness but in such a case there is also no question of a differentiated type 
but merely of a rela tively undeveloped thinking and feeling uniform consciousness and 
unconsciousness of functions is therefore a distinguishing mark of a primitive mentality  
experience shows that the secondary function is always one whose nature is different from 
thoug h not antagonistic to the leading function  thus for example thinking as primary 
function can readily pair with intuition as auxiliary or indeed equally well with sensation but 
as already observed never with feeling neither intuition nor sensati on are antagonistic to 
thinking ie they have not to be unconditionally excluded since they are not like feeling of 
similar nature though of opposite purpose to thinking  for as a judging function feeling 
successfully competes with thinking  but are functions of perception affording welcome 
assistance to thought as soon as they reached the same level of differentiation as thinking they 
would cause a change of attitude which would contradict the tendency of thinking for they 
would convert the  judging attitude into a perceiving one whereupon the principle of rationality 
indispensable to thought would be suppressed in favour of the irrationality of mere perception 
hence the auxiliary function is possible and useful only in so far as it serves the leading function 
without making any claim to the autonomy of its own principle  
for all the types appearing in practice the principle holds good that besides the conscious main 
function there is also a relatively unconscious auxiliary function whic h is in every respect 
different from the nature of the main function from these combinations well known pictures 
arise the practical intellect for instance paired with sensation the speculative intellect breaking 
through p  with intuition the art istic intuition which selects and presents its images by 
means of feeling judgment the philosophical intuition which in league with a vigorous intellect 
translates its vision into the sphere of comprehensible thought and so forth

a grouping of the u nconscious functions also takes place in accordance with the relationship of 
the conscious functions thus for instance an unconscious intuitive feeling attitude may 
correspond with a conscious practical intellect whereby the function of feeling suffers  a 
relatively stronger inhibition than intuition this peculiarity however is of interest only for one 
who is concerned with the practical psychological treatment of such cases but for such a man it 
is important to know about it for i have frequently o bserved the way in which a physician in 
the case for instance of an exclusively intellectual subject will do his utmost to develop the 
feeling function directly out of the unconscious this attempt must always come to grief since it 
involves too great a  violation of the conscious standpoint should such a violation succeed there 
ensues a really compulsive dependence of the patient upon the physician a transference which 
can be amputated only by brutality because such a violation robs the patient of a standpoint  
his physician becomes his standpoint but the approach to the unconscious and to the most 
repressed function is disclosed as it were of itself and with more adequate protection of the 
conscious standpoint when the way of development is via the secondary function thus in the 
case of a rational type by way of the irrational function for this lends the conscious standpoint 
such a range and prospect over what is possible and imminent that consciousness gains an 
adequate protection against t he destructive effect of the unconscious conversely an irrational 
type demands a stronger development of the rational auxiliary function p  represented in 
consciousness in order to be sufficiently prepared to receive the impact of the unconscious   
the unconscious functions are in an archaic animal state their symbolical appearances in 
dreams and phantasies usually represent the battle or coming encounter of two animals or 
monsters
