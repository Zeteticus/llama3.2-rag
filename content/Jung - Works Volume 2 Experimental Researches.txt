in an effort to determine standard reactions of nor mal people to association stimuli and in turn to 
establish a basis of comparison between normal an d mentally disturbed subjects diagnostic word 
association studies were conducted with known normal subjects a total of  normal ss were studied to 
determine their association patterns and to investigate the effects of attention on the associations ss 
were  educated men  educated women  unedu cated men and  uneducated women between the 
ages of  and  all judged to be normal the st udy was limited to associat ions produced by calling 
out stimulus words the  stimulus words  nouns  adjectives  verbs and  adverbs and 
numerals were taken from everyday life the number of syllables was not taken into account care was 
taken to eliminate any discrepanc y between standard german speak ing subjects and swiss german 
speaking subjects the research design also attempte d to control the differences in education the study 
was broken into three segments  measurement of reaction time in the first  reactions and 
description of psychic stat e   reactions recorded under the condi tion of internal distraction and  
a series sometimes not carried out until the second day which obs erved the effects of external 
distraction in  reactions some  word associat ions were obtained fro m each s and classified 
resulting in about  associations using a sche ma developed by aschaffe nburg the results were 
divided into four main categories internal associ ations external associations sound reactions and a 
miscellaneous classification incl uding indirect associations mean ingless reactions failures and 
repetition of the stimulus word also noted were the phenomena of  perseveration the egocentric 
reaction repetition of the reaction and linguistic connection tables a nd breakdown patterns of venous

in a study of word associations and attention in   normal subjects  educated women comprised one 
homogeneous study group of known normal subjects the level of education in the group of educated 
women was in general very high and most were well  read their colloquial language was predominantly 
the swissgerman dialect alth ough the material gathered from  reactions in this group was 
quantitatively uneven and the results  which are presented individually di ffered from subject to subject 
certain patterns were observed of the six subj ects over  years old three showed an average 
predominance of internal over extern al association of the eight subj ects under  years old however 
only one showed a predominance of internal as sociation of the ten women undergoing distraction 
experimentation five were subjected to both internal and exte rnal distraction two to  internal distraction 
only and three to external distraction only in four  cases external distrac tion was successful and 
internal distraction in three cases one case of internal distraction a nd one case of external distraction 
were partially successful di straction failed in four cases of whic h three were of the predicative type a 
type that showed an overall resist ance to distraction as compared to  the other subjects  references

in a stud y of word associations and attention in  normal sub jects a group of nine educated men 
comprised one homogeneous study group of known norma l subjects the group spoke mainly the swiss 
german dialect ranged from  to  years of ag e and produced  associations five ss were 
subjected to both internal and external distraction one underwen t internal distraction only one 
underwent external distraction only and two were not su bjected to any distracti on experiments five ss 
were also treated for association during fatigue and one wa s tested for association during a state of 
drowsiness only one s was of the predicative type a distraction experiment could not be earned out on 
him external distraction was succe ssful in two cases and moderately successful in two others in one 
case no definite effect was noted  internal distraction was successf ul in four cases the most 
characteristic feature was a sharp increase in sound reactions in one other case there was no definite 
result in three of five cases the associations obt ained in fatigue gave a re sult similar to that of 
distraction the association experi ment in drowsiness also yielded results similar to those of a 
distraction experiment under normal conditions f our of the subjects exhibited extensive complex 
phenomena it also appeared that a lengthening reaction time indicates that the particular stimulus word 
has touched upon a feeling tone d complex  references

a group of eight uneducated women comprised one hom ogeneous group of ss in  a study of association 
and attention of  normal ss all were fairly inte lligent ranged in age from  to  and more than 
half had attended secondary school s they produced a total of  associations each completed  
associations under normal conditions and  associ ations under external distraction the uneducated 
ss were not tested under internal distraction conditions two ss were of the predicative type and the 
distraction experiment failed one s demonstrated pr edicate type behavior by not following instructions 
all the time and another doubled her efforts making th e distraction phase only pa rtially successful four 
ss showed positive results during the distraction e xperiment although this experiment required a much 
greater effort of them than th e same experiment under normal condi tions the uneducated women as a 
whole showed the least ability to  divide their attention the resu lts show measurable differences 
between these subjects and both educated women a nd educated men the most notable being that sound 
associations have a lesser role as distraction phe nomena in uneducated women than in the educated 
groups of either sex there are usually relatively more internal reactions and fewer linguistic motor 
forms in uneducated than in educated subjects  reference

seven uneducated men comprising one homogeneous  group of  ss who took part in a study of 
associations and attention were al l fairly intelligent but five of them had had only elementary 
education five of them spoke the swissgerman dialect the group produced  associations as in 
experiments with uneducated women only external distr action was used five of the ss were affected by 
external distraction of the two who were predicativ e types one was not affect ed and one showed some 
reaction to external distraction in  all these ss as in the group of uneducated women sound associations 
as signs of distraction occurred less than in th e educated groups two ss who produced many groupings 
few predicates and many reactions wi th the same grammatical form also  showed a paucity of egocentric 
reactions and constellations two of the uneducated women had show n the same features the group as 
a whole was distinguished by the fact that there were few complex constellations subjectivity and 
feelings were less prominent in the uneducated me n than in the uneducated women this difference 
between the sexes was not demonstrated in the educat ed ss also noted was the high incidence of erotic 
complexes amon g the com plexes that were uncovered althou gh significant in all ss erotic com plexes

internal or external factors caus es a blunting of the reaction type distraction of attention causes 
additionally an increase of indirect  associations educated subjects generally showed a blunter reaction 
type than uneducated subjects wh ich can be explained by a difference  in interpretation of stimulus 
words but there was no noticeable difference betwee n educated and uneducated subjects in the degree 
of division of attention the most dr amatic variations in associations were due to individual differences 
no differences between sexes emerged except that in the distraction experiment female subjects 
appeared less able to divide atte ntion than male subjects the result s also show that the blunting of 
reaction type in fatigue alcoholic intoxication and mani a may be attributed to a disturbance of attention

 an analysis of the asso ciations of an epileptic  in jung c collected works of c g jung 
vol  princeton university press   p p   
the word association reactions of a t ypical case of epilepsy are analyzed as part of a larger investigation 
attempting to separate what is specific for epileptic  associations from the various types of the normal 
and from congenital mental deficiency the case was drawn from studies of  patients at the swiss 
asylum for epileptics in zurich and the burgholzli psychiatric clinic  limited to subjects who were not 
congenitally mentally defective and had not shown si gns of epilepsy in early youth ss were carefully 
prepared for the experiments and presented with  stimulus word s  denoting concrete ideas  
denoting abstract ideas  adjectives and  verbs  all drawn from everyday life one male s had 
appeared normal until his wife developed a psychosis and died when s was  he then began 
wandering all over europe was freque ntly apprehended for drinking and theft had been hospitalized for 
violent manic episodes and delirium and had fractured his skull nine years before the study took place 
the results of the experiment s howed some similarities to associ ations of normal persons some 
similarities to associations of imbeciles and some unique peculiar ities s adapted himself to the 
of the stimulus word in the same way as norma l uneducated subjects with no superficial word 
associations in common with the associations of imbe ciles there were associatio ns in sentence form or 
the stimulus word was frequently repeated there was an intense adaptation to the meaning of the 
stimulus word so that a great numbe r of the associations were explan ations and the reaction times were 
considerably longer than in normal subjects they s howed the greatest variati on only after the critical 
reaction which indicates the influence of perseverati ng emotional charges rather  than of particularly 
difficult words this case suggests th at feeling tone probably sets in later and lasts longer in the epileptic 
than in normal ss  references  
 the reactiontime ratio in the association experiment in jung c collected works of c g 
jung vol  princeton universit y press   p p   
the reaction time ratio was analy zed in  of  normal subjects male and female educated and 
uneducated participating in  a word association experiment reacti on times that exceeded the probable 
mean for the s concerned were examined particularly  closely the average reaction time measured with 
a stop watch came out to  seconds for both educat ed and uneducated ss males averaged  seconds 
compared to  seconds for females and educated ss averaged  seconds compared to  seconds in 
the uneducated group the quality of the stimulus word seemed to ex ert an influence on reaction time 
the average shortest times followed  concrete nouns and the longest ti mes followed abstract nouns and 
verbs educated men were the exception to this rule in  that their longest average times followed concrete 
nouns the quality of the reaction also seemed to influence reaction time th e longest times occured 
with abstract nouns  seconds and the shortest times with adjectives and verbs  seconds 
again educated men were an exception their longe st time occurring with concrete nouns the quality 
of the association also exerted influence internal  associations required a l onger reaction time than 
external ones sound reaction usually caused by inne r distractions also showed a relatively long 
reaction time long reaction times were usually caused by intense em otions and may have been used to 
uncover conscious and unconscious complexes which could be important in hysteria sometimes the 
feeling tone can extend to subsequent reactions th e majority  of prolonged reaction times tended 
to follow certain stimulus words that have affect ive value while only  of prolonged reaction tunes 
were due to the difficulty of the word  references  
 experimental observations on the faculty of memory in jung c collected works of c g 
jung vol  princeton university  press   p p   
a new technique the reprodu ction method was used to identify associations attributable to complexes 
to determine whether failures of memory are accidental  or whether there is a pattern to them after the 
completion of an association test  the experiment was repeated to find out whether the s remembered 
how he reacted to individual stimulus words in  two ss both male one aged  and undergoing 
psychoanalytic treatment and one aged  an exci table and sensitive person it was found that the 
incorrect reproductions of answers to the repeated stimulus words were thos e that were directly 
constellated by a feeling toned complex or those that immediately followed a critical one these 
disturbances of memo ry are cases of a general tendency to re press and forget an unpleasant impression 
in the case of a yearold hysterical woman th e amnestic blockages extended over many subsequent 
reactions and were considered hysterical amnesia  the reproduction method could be very useful in 
cases where analysis is difficult and in criminology  references  
 psychoanalysis and association experiments  in jung c collected works of c g jung 
vol  princeton university press   p p   
the usefulness of the association e xperiment in psychoanalysis is illus trated in a case of obsessional 
neurosis the patient female single   years old an educated intelligent teacher wanted to try 
hypnosis for insomnia she was extremely nervous a nd restless had a tic and admitted to having 
obsessional ideas she felt that a woman neighbor  who had died recently had on ss account died 
without the last sacrament and before that had be en haunted for several years by the fear that a boy 
whom she as a governess had brought up had died because she had occasionally beaten him when she 
could not be hypnotized the association experiment  and the reproduction test were used the mean 
reaction time of  very high for an educated person  indicated a strong emotionality the associations 
showed that the woman had an erotic complex wh ich she denied gradually however she revealed a 
repressed obsession with sexual fantasies which was traced back to a childhood sexual trauma 
repressing her sexual obsessions had led to obsessi ons in other areas in her life although s still 
suffered from insomnia after three weeks of fre udian analysis she announced several months after 
treatment that all obsessional ideas had disappeared a nd she could now sleep it is concluded that word 
associations can be a valuable aid in reco gnizin g the nature of the com plex that is the cause of the 
illness facilitating and shortening freudian psychoanalysis once the sp litoff contents of the mind are 
released from a repression they can be destroyed through an effort of  the will the associations also 
supply scientific insight into the origin and structure of psychogenic neuroses  references

diagnosing criminal cases by studying the psychologi cal makeup of the witness through the word 
association method is discussed the historical  development of the method is outlined and the 
association experiment is desc ribed when stimulus words are cal led out a subjects reaction is 
determined by the individual conten t of his ideas a large number of component ideas charged with a 
feeling tone constitute a complex which can be identified by reaction content lengthened reaction time 
and memory lapses during the reproduction method in which the experiment is repeated the practical 
application of the association method in criminal ca ses is illustrated by its use in a case of a young man 
suspected of theft thirty seven critical stimulus  words distributed among  irrelevant ones produced 
such suspicious reactions reacti on times and memory lapses in the reproduction phase that the 
investigator accused the young man and s finally conf essed since it was considered possible that s 
reacted more strongly than a hardened criminal woul d have a control experiment was conducted with an 
informed subject and an uninformed one the disa ppointing results with symptoms of a complex 
observed at critical points in both subjects reveal  a fundamental weakness in the experiment the 
multiplicity of meanings that the stimulus words can have many more than  stimulus words should 
be used the young mans reactions did however show mo re symptoms of a complex than the controls 
although the association method should be used onl y by experts and until it  is further refined 
cautiously it has many possi bilities  references  
 association dream and hysterical symptom  in jung c collected works of c g jung 
vol  princeton university press   p p   
the anomalies of word association in hysteria are illustrated by the case of a yearold girl who was 
extremely restless feared madness and complained of unbearable heat sensations in the head the 
symptoms dated from her first menstruation at  and s uperseded chorea that had developed at age  s 
physically healthy and fairly inte lligent was the youngest child of five her mother was completely 
crippled by osteomalacia the asso ciation experiment was marked by an enormous number of failures 
abnormally long reaction times a nd other complex constellations s howing that she was dominated by a 
number of complexes particularly an illness co mplex a sexual complex and a school complex since 
the psychoanalysis was proceeding wi th difficulty the patients dreams  were also studied the dream 
analysis confirmed the sexual complex and accompanying blockage s revealed by the association test 
suggested a possible childhood sexual trauma this erot ic complex included some  romantic attachment 
to the therapist accompanied by a feeling of reje ction and denial the chil dhood chorea was diagnosed 
as a hysterical symptom devised to  avoid writing lessons and going to  school and the heat sensations 
were symptomatic of the sexual complex intensifie d in ss case by her fear of osteomalacia in 
pregnancy although the patient showed some improve ment in treatment her condition deteriorated 
after discharge effective treatment  of hysteria should strengthen what remains of the normal ego and is 
best achieved by introducing a new comple x to liberate the ego  references  
 the psychopathological significance of the association experiment  in jung c collected 
works of c g jung vol  princeton university press   p p   
the value to psychopathology of th e association experiment in wh ich the subject says what is 
immediately called to mind when a stimulus word is called out lies in the fact that association is a 
necessar y sequence followin g certain laws in s pite of ob jections based on the principles of chance and 
free will the work of kraepelin aschaffenburg and others has empirically es tablished cert ain patterns 
and rules the associations have been divided into internal associations in which the meaning of the 
words is the connecting link and external associatio ns in which the connecting link is an external 
contingency in sound associations the response is a word  that sounds like the stimulus word it has been 
discovered that the more the attention of the s ubject decreases the more the external and sound 
associations increase this law is  potentially important to understa nding psychopathological states in 
which the ability to concentrate is often disturbe d the associations are determined by the whole 
personality and background long reaction times indicat e feeling toned complexes found in all normal 
subjects and very pronounced in psychopathology in hyste rical patients the times of critical reactions 
are much longer and the barriers to recollection much stronger than  in normal subjects two simple 
examples of the symptomatology of hysteria show that  the hysterical patient suffers from a disorder of 
the affect he has been unable to  conquer and which his conscious mind finds unbearable the same 
mechanism is demonstrated in deme ntia praecox although othe r elements are also found in this disease

 disturbances of reproduction in the association experiment  in jung c collected works o f 
c g jung vol  princeton univ ersity press   p p   
statistics are given to support an earlier unfinished paper experimental obse rvations on the faculty o f 
memory introducing the repro duction method which was repeatedly  criticized the earlier paper 
maintained that most of a subjects memory failu res in attempting to repr oduce the original answers 
given on an association test can be traced to co mplexes although this memory failure had been 
observed in many cases it was investigated in onl y two cases in which it was particularly pronounced 
the material presented from  cas es is heterogeneous since only th ree subjects were normal and the 
rest were widely varying neurotics and psychotics the results are similar to those of the first study a 
relation is established between incorrect reproduction and prolonged reaction time on the original 
association the disturbance is usuall y correlated directly with a prol onged reaction ti me but in some 
cases it follows a prolonged reaction time the associ ation that is incorrectly reproduced has on the 
average twice as many complex signs as the correc tly reproduced one including such characteristics as 
reaction by two or more words if this is not typical for the subject repetition or misunderstanding of the 
the stimulus word slips of the tongue and use of a fo reign word the complex characteristics tend to be 
grouped around certain specific associations  references

the association method is descri bed and some of its practical a pplications are discussed in the 
association experiment the subject  gives his immediate response to each of  preselected stimulus 
words the listed stimulus words re present a mixture of different part s of speech and are chosen to 
touch on the complexes that commonly occur emot ionally charged reactions are revealed by such 
disturbances as prolonged reaction times failure to respond res ponding with additions repetition of the 
stimulus words and perseveration th e four principal types of associat ions are  the objective type 
with undisturbed reactions  the complex type showi ng many disturbances caused by constellations of 
complexes  the definition t ype found chiefly among stupid people and  the predicate type which 
usually betrays a deficiency of f eeling in the reproduction test the s timulus words are repeated and the 
subject is asked to recall his earlier reactions memo ry lapses are often caused by stimulus words that 
touch on a feeling toned complex or that immediately follow critical words practical aspects of the 
association method are illu strated in a case where it was used to  detect the real culprit among three 
nurses suspected of theft in the interview of the gu ilty nurse the critical stimul us words relating to the 
theft produced the longest reaction times the most  complex characteristics and the most incorrect 
reproductions  
 the family constellation  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  princeton

to investigate theories on the family the associati on experiment was applied to  families consisting 
of  subjects who produced  associations th e associations were pr ocessed according to 
logical linguistic criteria and it wa s found that  relatives tend to s how an agreement in reaction type 
 reaction types of children  are closer to those of the mother than  those of the father and  marriage 
seems to change the association type more in wome n than in men the similari ty of associations of 
related subjects is often remarkable  as is illustrated in the case of a mother and daughter that 
demonstrates how unhealthy emotions understandabl e and no longer dangerous in a parent can be 
transmitted to a child in whom they can be dange rous the strongest influences on a child are the 
unconscious personal affective states  of his parents and teachers other cases show how lives and 
marriages that are founded on too strong an attachemen t to the parents can be crippled through neuroses 
so that the child remains imprisoned in infantile re lationships one of the most important aims of 
education should be to free the growing child from hi s unconscious attachment to the influences of his 
early environment so that he may ke ep what is valuable and reject what is not the need for additional 
research into childrens emotional processes  about which not enough is known is stressed

the galvanic phenomenon reported by dr ve raguth of zurich which he called the 
galvanopsychophysical reflex and its use in valida ting the results of the a ssociation experiment are 
discussed a galvanometer was introduced into the circuit of a  volt current passed through the human 
body it was found that a stimulus applied to the subj ect would cause an increase in the current the 
increase was related not to the strength of the stimulus  but to the intensity of the resulting feeling tone 
and appeared not at the moment the stimulus was perceived but after a late nt period of  seconds 
veraguth concluded that in this experiment feelings  were objectively repres ented a specially designed 
apparatus can record long curves to represent feel ing tones aroused by the association experiment an 
example shows how strong feeling t ones that accompany an associatio n cause characteristic and regular 
disturbances in the associ ation processes but the method of inte rpreting the disturbances is still not 
scientifically deve loped the galvanopsychophysical reflex ma y be a means to help define the 
complex and its feeling tone graphi c representations of galvanic os cillations during two association 
experiments produced distinct curves that showed strong feeling tones corres ponding to disturbances in 
association reactions   references  
 psychophysical investigations with the galvanometer and pneumograph in normal and 
insane individuals  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  princeton university press 
  p p   
galvanometric and pneumographic curves record ed simultaneously on the kymograph under the 
influence of various sensory and psychical stimuli were studied to evaluate the psychophysical 
galvanic reflex and the respiratory innervation curve as records of psychical changes to determine their 
normal and pathological variations and to compare thes e curves in word associations the reaction time 
was also recorded forty series of curves were recorded in eight normal subjects and  in  cases of 
dementia praecox of differ ent types in normal subjects it was f ound that every stimul us accompanied by 
an emotion caused a rise in the electric curve directly  proportional to the intensity and actuality of the 
emotion the information gathered from the pneumogr aph curves in both normal and pathological cases 
was inconclusive but it a ppeared that there was very little re lationship between the galvanometric and 
nomographic curves other than an inverse one inhibi tions in breathing were caused by expectation and 
tension rather than b y the unconscious emotions that re gister stron gly on the galvanometer the 
galvanometer curves in the dementia  praecox patients included some that were very labile and some that 
were similar to curves in normal subjects some cata tonic patients hardly registered at all and their 
period of latency was markedly protracted word asso ciations in normal subjects carried out with only 
four subjects showed that there was a relationship between length of reaction time and height of the 
galvanometer curve and between altered reproductions  and height of the galvanometer curve these 
relationships support the hypothesis that long reaction times and alte red reproductions are affective 
phenomena only two of the dementia praecox patien ts could be tested with  associations there was 
nothing unusual in their galvanometer curves during the association experiment but they both showed 
abnormal associations lengthened reaction times numerous complex constellations and an abnormal 
number of altered reproductions it is concluded that  the thought mechanisms in dementia praecox are 
probably not pathological but that the abnormality is in the patient s reaction to his complexes

p p   
a series of simple physical and me ntal stimuli was administered to  normal subjects and  patients 
suffering from various mental diseases to de termine effects on the galvanic phenomenon and on 
respiration the galvanometric changes were recorded by a galvanometer introduced into the circuit of a 
low volt current passed through the body the respirat ion was recorded by pneumograph in many of the 
abnormal ss however the pneumograph could not be us ed these experiments indicate the following 
the galvanic reaction depend s on attention to the stimul us and the ability to associate it with previous 
occurrences this association may be conscious but is usually uncons cious galvanic reactions show 
great individual variation and within some limits are independent of th e original bodily resistance in 
these experiments physic stimuli caused greater galvanic fluctuations than psychological ones which 
may have been due to the fact that the physical stim uli occurred earlier in the experiment early stimuli 
usually cause stronger reactions than later ones beca use of the elements of tension and expectation 
normal reactions vary widely but ar e nearly always stronger than pat hological ones galvanic reactions 
are low in depression and stupor because of poor a ttention and inhibition of associations and are 
virtually nonexistent in dementia because of lack of associations reactions are high in alcoholism and 
in the euphoric stage of general paralysis from the pneumographic measurements it was concluded that 
the inspiratory rate varies from in dividual to individual there is usua lly a decrease in the amplitude of 
the inspirations during the rise of the galvanic cu rve this decrease varies according to the subject 
however and has no relation to the height of the galvan ic curve in cases of dementia in which there is 
no galvanic reaction there are respiratory change s but they are very slight  reference
