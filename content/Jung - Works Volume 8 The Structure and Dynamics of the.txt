introduction  in jung c collected works of c g j ung vol nd ed princeton university press 
  p p  
the introduction to a reexamination of the authors concept of libi do is presented it is generally 
recognized that physical events can be looked at from a mechanistic or  from an energic standpoint the 
mechanistic view is purely causal and is concerned with the moving substance itself the energic view 
on the other hand is final it is not founded on the substances themse lves but on the relations of the 
movement of substances a third conception which is  a compromise of mechan istic and energic gives 
rise to many theoretical hybrids but yi elds a relatively fait hful picture of  reality it is mentioned in 
closing that all explanatory pr inciples are only points of view  depending less upon the objective 
behavior of things than upon the psychological a ttitude of the investigator and thinker

collected works of c g jung vol  nd ed pr inceton university press   p p   
the existence of the unconscious is reviewed in th e writings of several authors starting in the th 
century prior to that time the history of psychology consisted mainly in the enumeration of doctrines 
concerning the soul this study was entirely subjective and philosophical it was not until the 
seventeenth century that christia n von wolf put forth the idea of em pirical or experi mental psychology 
psychology then became a natural science but it did not enjoy the status of the older and more 
recognized sciences at the turn of the th cen tury the unconscious as a hypothetical concept was 
being generally rejected by such writers as wilhelm wundt but fechner lipps and herbart foretold its 
present significance lipps remarks form the theore tical basis for the psychology of the unconscious in 
general nevertheless re sistance to the hypothesis of the unc onscious persisted for a long time

the importance of the uncons cious as a psychological concept a nd the impact of its formulation on 
european intellectual history are examined the unc onscious tentatively desc ribed as a subliminal 
consciousness was first posited by fredric meyers in  this discovery is considered to have 
revolutionized psychology as much as the discovery of  radioactivity has changed physics it was resisted 
at first however by both psychologists and philos ophers wundts objections to the theory of the 
unconscious are reviewed and rebutted and its mome ntous impact on the theory of knowledge is 
documented once the hypothesis of the unconscious is  accepted then it follow s that all our knowledge 
must be incomplete since the repository of know ledge the psyche is only partially accessible to 
consciousness thus the validity of conscious knowle dge was threatened much more seriously than it 
ever had been by critical epistemology the trend in german philosophy since hegels victory over 
kant had been to rebuke kants critique of reason and to reinstate the godlike sovereignty of the human 
spirit this movement culminated in the hubris of reason that was nietzsches superman and led to the 
catastrophe of nazi germany it is pointed out th at all philosophical statem ents that transgress the 
bounds of reason are anthropomorphic and have no validity other th an as unintentional psychology  
 on the nature of the psyche  th e dissociability of the psyche  in jung c collected 
works of c g jun g vol  nd ed princeton universit y press   p p    
the phenomenon of the psyches dissoci ability is explored as an expl anation of the capacity of the 
unconscious for volition wundt had objected to the theory of the unconscious on the grounds that the 
ability to perceive feel and act presupposes an expe riencing subject this subject  could not be logically 
posited in the unconscious it is poin ted out that clinical experience verifies the disso ciability of the 
psyche that unconscious processes are independent of the conscious mind and that conscious processes 
display a discreteness psychiatric experience indicates that  the unity of consciousness can easily be 
shattered this dissociability accounts for the existenc e of a secondary conscious ness that is subliminal 
it represents a personality component that is separa ted from ego consciousness  either because it was 
repressed or because it was never conscious in the first place this second category represents those 
contents of the unconscious that ar e the seeds of future conscious c ontents but as yet are not understood 
by the conscious mind and hence remain unconscious  consciousness is compared to the sense 
modalities in terms of having a th reshold for perception this concept of threshold is extended to the 
psyche and the term psychoid is discussed as a designation for those psychic processes that fall at 
each end of the psychic scale it i s concluded that the hypothesis of the unconscious can be verified 
only if the contents of the unconscious can be  brought into consciousness  references

the place of instinct and will in the superstructure of the psyc he is examined the pioneering work of 
freud and janet in the field of the unconscious is br iefly reviewed as an intr oduction to the problem of 
how to delineate the psyche from the physiological  the link between the repressed contents of the 
unconscious and instinct was established by freud  as instincts are bound up in physiology the problem 
of separation was made more difficult janets divi sion of the psyche into the partie inferieure which is 
ruled by instinct and the partie s uperieure which is under the influenc e of the will provided a tentative 
solution the intrinsic energy of function is no longer oriented by instinct once it passes from the lower 
to the upper realm moreover just as instinct is the lower limit of the wi ll so is spirit its upper limit 
thus the psyche is conceived as an  emancipation of function  from instinctual form the psyche proper is 
said to consist of all functions that can be brought und er the influence of the wi ll but as will resides 
only in consciousness this discussion of  will and instinct is seen to lead a full circle to the axiom that 
the psyche is identical with c onsciousness a point of disagreeme nt with janet  references

the nature of the unconscious is e xplored visavis the conscious in an  attempt to refute the axiom that 
the psyche is equivalent to consci ousness the unconscious is said to be composed of all that has been 
forgotten repressed and perceived by the senses  but not recognized by the conscious mind all the 
future contents of the conscious that are germin ating in the unconscious a nd the contents of the 
psychoid system the state of these contents when they  are not related to the conscious ego is surmised 
to he much the same as when they are there is perception feeling thinking volition and intention just 
as if the unconscious were a subcons cious one difference however is in the area of feelingtoned 
complexes in the unconscious these complexes are not subject to correction as they are in the conscious 
mind and are capable of developing an automatic or  compulsive character the unconscious processes 
are seen to stretch across a broad sp ectrum of behaviors ranging from the conscious to the instinctual it 
is the near conscious area that holds the answer to whether or not the psyche is equivalent to 
consciousness an examination of this border area reveal s that consciousness is re lative that the light of 
consciousness has many degrees of brightness and that the ego complex ha s many gradations of 
emphasis it is concluded that th e ego consciousness is surrounded by a multitude of little luminosities

collected works of c g jung vol  nd ed pr inceton university pre ss   p p   
the hypothesis that ego consciousne ss is surrounded by a multitude of luminosities rests partly on the 
quasi conscious state of the uncon scious and partly on the high incidence of light imagery in 
descriptions of consciousness various alchemic hi ndu and christian writings are examined for their 
use of light imagery in describing the nature of consciousness man and their metaphysics the 
alchemists khunrath dor n and paracelsus wrote of a lumen natura e that illuminates consciousness and 
of scintillae sparks that are the germinal lu minosities shining forth from the darkness of the 
unconscious ignatius loyola wrote of a recurrent vision he had of a bright light that took the shape of a 
multieyed serpent multiple eyes  also characterize purusha the hindu cosmic man these metaphysical 
systems and visions are interpreted as introspective in tuitions that capture the nature of the unconscious 
since consciousness has always been described in te rms derived from the beha vior of light it is 
concluded that these multiple luminosities corres pond to tiny conscious phenomena many of which 
reside in the unconscious  
 on the nature of the psyche  patt erns of behavior and archetypes  in jung c collected 
works of c g jung vol  nd ed princet on university press    p p   
the relationship between inst inct and archetypes is explored and th eir effects on the psyche is discussed 
though they are polar opposites instinct and the archetyp e meet in the biological conception of patterns 
of behavior the problem of discoveri ng these patterns of behavior is solved through an analysis of the 
dreams fantasies and art work of mental patients  the chaotic assortment of images found therein fell 
into well defined themes and categories that corr esponded to the universal mo tifs of mythology from 
this remarkable finding it is deduced that impulses from the unconscious ie archetypes are the spifitus 
rector of the human in tellect opposed to the spiritua l aspect of the psyche is th e instinctual instincts are 
seen to be grounded in physiology and to provide the dr iving energy of the psyche it is just such an 
instinctual drive that forces the archetypal contents  of the collective unconscious into consciousness 
the psyche is compared to the light spectrum to il lustrate how it gradually passes from the physiology 
of instinct to the spirituality of archetypes only the representations of archetypes are mediated by the 
unconscious to the conscious mind as the archetypes themselves are at the ultraviolet end of the 
spectrum and are thus unknowable it is concluded th at both matter and spirit appear in the psychic 
realm as distinctive qualiti es of conscious contents the ultimate nature of both is transcendental since 
the psyche and its contents are th e only reality that is given to us without a medium  references

the importance of psychology for mans continued existence is di scussed psychology is unique among 
the sciences in that its object of study is the expe riencing subject of the other sciences therefore an 
alteration of the psychic factor be  it an alteration of principle is  of the utmost significance for 
knowledge of the world and our world view the integr ation of unconscious contents into consciousness 
is such an alteration and one that is held to be essential for mans survival modern man identifies too 
closely with the contents of the collective consci ous and represses the contents of the collective 
unconscious this leads to a onesideness that allows modern man to fall easy prey to various isms 
the catastrophe of nazi germany underlines the se riousness of this mistake medieval man was 
protected by his religious faith which in terms of effe ctiveness corresponds to the attitude induced in 
the ego by the integration of the contents of the co llective unconscious with the decline of religious 
faith in the west the isms rose up as sophisticated  substitutes for mans lost  link with psychic reality 
since religious ideas have their origin in archetypes man can re establish his psychic balance by 
assimilatin g the contents of the collective uncons cious into the conscious mind this process termed 
individuation is held  to be the goal of psychology its accomplish ment requires special conditions and it 
carries with it the possibility of taking a pathological turn wi th disastrous consequences  
 on the nature of the psyche supplement  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol

the investigative problems and proc edures of psychology are compared to  those of physics in order to 
elucidate the conceptual foundations of the ps yche the objection that the psychology of the 
unconscious is a philosophy designed to explain myt hologems is answered by demonstrating that the 
theory of archetypes evolved as an  explanatory construct for the obser ved effects of the unconscious it 
is admitted however that a true knowledge of the states and processes of the unconscious is not 
attainable since these phenomena are not directly observable the psychology of the unconscious is 
compared to atomic physics in that both draw infere nces about the nature of unobservable events from 
their observable effects it is also pointed out that  both sciences have to deal with the methodological 
problem that is raised when the observing subject ha s an effect on the obser ved object in psychology 
the observing consciousness produces a reactive effect  in the unconscious and thus limits the objective 
character of the latters reality since the unconscious has a reciprocal influence on the conscious mind 
it follows that the nature  of the archetype cannot with certaint y be designated as psychic grounds for 
this conjecture are found in the phenomenon of te lepathy which is perfectly explicable on the 
assumption of a psychically relati ve spacetime continuum it is hypothesized that perhaps the psyche 
touches matter at some point and conversel y that matter contains a latent psyche  
 general aspects of dream psychology  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol

a summary of the established facts of dream psychology together with an  outline of jungs dream theory 
visavis freuds theory are presente d it is accepted that the origin st ructure and cont ent of dreams are 
discontinuous with waking consciousness it is furthe r recognized that there is a hidden meaning to 
dreams beyond their manifest content the method fo r discovering this hidden meaning is illustrated 
through the analysis of a psychiat ric patients dream it is pointed  out that the explanation of a 
psychological fact will be determin ed by the point of view of the e xplainer therefore the dream is 
explained in regards to causality th e freudian point of view and finali ty the jungian point of view the 
former attempts to find the cause of the dream white  the latter seeks its purpose the symbolism of the 
dream is interpreted accordingly the one discovers symbolism that conceals the other symbolism that 
guides this theory of dreams also differs from fr euds in regard to the proposed function of dreams 
freud posits a wish fulfilment function to dreams  while jung assigns them a compensatory function 
according to the latter theo ry dreams should be interpreted on a subj ective level ieall figures in the 
dream are interpreted as pe rsonified features of the dreamers personality rath er than reflections of 
external reality the classification of dreams is held to  have little practical or theoretical value but the 
recognition of typical motifs is seen as an invaluable  insight in that it points out the correspondence 
between dream motifs and mythological motifs t hus the figurative language of dreams can be 
interpreted as a surviving remnant of the archaic m ode of thought the charge that these psychological 
views arc metaphysical are refuted by pointing out that religious conc epts are useful in explaining 
psychological facts since they themselves  are psychological facts  references  
 on the nature of dreams  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  nd ed 
princeton university press   p p   
the fundamental aspects of dream psychology and interpretation are ex plained for edification of the 
layman dreams are defined as irrational fragments of involuntar y psychic activity a procedure for 
interpreting dreams presented consists of elicitin g from the dreamer ever y shade of meanin g which each 
salient feature of the dream has fo r him though dreams refer to a de finite conscious situation their 
roots lie buried in the unconscious since the mean ing of most dreams is not in accord with the 
tendencies of the conscious mind it is assume d that they serve an unconscious function the 
unconscious is seen to have a compensatory function in relation to the conscious mind ieit acts to 
balance any onesideness that may occur in the consci ous sphere thus the analysis of dreams is an 
invaluable aid in treating a neurosis which result s from a psychic imbalanc e another function of 
dreams which expresses itself in the symbolism of a long dream series is to aid in the individuation 
process such dreams spring from the collective unconsci ous which is replete with mythological motifs 
that guide the individuat ion process though the form of dreams has great flexibil ity many dreams fall 
into a definite structure this stru cture is analayzed and shown to be essentially dramatic and to consist 
of four phases in conclusion it is pointed out that no generally satisf ying theory of dreams that would 
enable one to deal with the far reaching philo sophical and religious pr oblems encountered when 
studying them has yet been fo rmulated  references  
 the psychological foundatio n of belief in spirits in jung c collected works of c g jung 
vol  nd ed princeton universi ty press   p p   
a psychological interpretation of the problem of spirits is sketched fr om the standpoint of the present 
knowledge of unconscious processes  only the psychological side of  the problem is examined the 
question of whether spirits exist in themselves is left to a two paragraph epilogue th at refers the reader to 
other authors although the past history of man reveal s a universal belief in the existence of spirits 
among western peoples this belief has been c ounteracted by rationalism for the primitive the 
phenomenon of spirits is direct eviden ce of a spiritual world and for them a belief in the human soul is 
a necessary premise for belief in spirits the three main  sources that put the belief in spirits on a solid 
foundation are dreams visions and psychic distur bances these three phenom ena are analyzed and 
their common denominator is found to  be the psychological fact that th e psyche is a divisible entity 
among the separate parts of the psyche are certain fr agments that never become associated with the ego 
these are termed autonomous complexes spirits viewed from a psychological angle are unconscious 
autonomous complexes which appear as projections be cause they have no direct association with the 
ego parallels are drawn between the belief of primitive pe oples in souls and spirits and psychologys 
formulation of the personal and collective unconsci ous souls correspond to the autonomous complexes 
of the personal unconscious spirits to  those of the collective unconscious  the association experiment is 
discussed as a means for demonstrati ng the existence of these complexes it is noted that when excited 
by an external stimulus these complexes can produce sudden confusion or violent effects or they may 
express themselves as hallucinations spirits then are autonomous complexes of the collective 
unconscious that appear when the indivi dual loses his adaptation to reality

the connection between spirit and life is the theme of a lecture delivered to the literary society of 
augsburg the basic ambiguity of the term spirit which causes many to confuse it with mind noted 
and an empirical definition of the term is sought the psyche and the conscious mind are examined and 
though their natures are seen to be ultimately unknowab le it is concluded that anything psychic will 
take on the quality of consciousness if it comes in to contact with the ego since ego consciousness 
however is not seen as embracing the entire psyche one is cautioned that what  lies beyond it may be far 
different from what is imagined a review of epis temology and a survey of the various usages of the 
word  spirit reveal that spirit denotes a psyc hic experience which can neither be grasped from a 
rationalistic standpoint nor proven to exist in the external world a concept of  spirit is advanced that 
goes beyond the animistic framework a nd holds spirit to be a supr apersonal guiding force it is 
hypothesized that it is this s pirit that lies be yond the sco pe of e go consciousness the intent of this 
unconscious force is held to be superior to the intent of consciousness life is seen as the touchstone for 
the truth of the spirit man finds himself between these two powers consciousness and unconsciousness 
with the spirit giving meaning to life a nd life giving expression to the spirit  
 basic postulates of analytical psychology  in jung c collected works of c  jung vol

the prevailing materialisti c outlook of the age is seen to be opposed  to the basic postulates of analytic 
psychology materialism is criticized as a philosophical system and characterized as an overreaction to 
the excessively spiritual outlook of the gothic age mate rialism with its view that the psyche is nothing 
but a product of biochemical processes  is rejected in favor of analyt ic psychology a psychology with a 
psyche that postulates the existence of an autonomous  spiritual principle a su rvey of primitive mans 
view of the soul and the psyche reveals a remarkab le resemblance between th ese primitive beliefs and 
the postulates of analytic psychology  both recognize that the soul is the life of the body that ego 
consciousness is an expression of the soul and th at ego consciousness grows out of the unconscious 
analytic psychology further holds that the unconsciou s psyche is a system of in herited psychic 
functions that predates the development of ego cons ciousness and that it is a source of knowledge the 
conflict between nature and spirit  so obvious in the world today is seen to be a reflection of the 
paradoxical nature of the psyche it is concluded that psychi c reality still exists in its original oneness 
and awaits mans advance to that le vel of consciousness where he will  no longer believe exclusively in 
one side of its dual nature  and repress the other  
 analytic psychology and weltanschauung  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol 
 nd ed princeton university press   p p   
the contribution of analytic ps ychology to the formation of a new weltanschauung is discussed the 
personality is seen to be essentially related to  weltanschauung since consci ousness determines mans 
world view and that conversely man orients himself a nd adapts to reality in accordance with his world 
view the basic tenets of psychoanalysis are ex amined and judged to produce a weltanschauung of 
rationalistic materialism th is perspective is considered inadequate in that it ignores the vast irrational 
production of the psyche analytic psychology on the ot her hand is considered to contribute to a more 
complete weltanschauung by its recognition of the ex istence of certain unconscious contents which 
cannot be rationalized but with which the conscious mind must come to terms the contents of the 
collective unconscious the result of the psychic f unctioning of mans whole ancestry are seen to 
represent the matrix of experience from which all future ideas will come however the contents of the 
unconscious do not themselves constitu te a world view but must be tran slated into the language of the 
present it is felt that if this process is successf ully completed the world wi ll be perceived as having 
reunited with the primordial experience of mankind it  is toward this ideal world view that analytic 
psychology attempts to break down the confining wa lls of rationalism by une arthing the irrational 
fantasy material of the unconscious  reference

the western view of what constitutes reality is compared to the eastern view according to the western 
view everything is real which come s or seems to come from the worl d as revealed by the senses this 
restriction of reality to the materi al although seemingly comprehensive is  but a fragment of reality as a 
whole this narrow perspective is alien to the ea stern view of the world wh ich grants everything the 
status of reality therefore the east unlike the west does not need to formulate a concept of 
superreality to account for the nature of the psyc he previously western ma n had granted the psyche 
only an indirect realit y derived from its proposed physical causes he is now be ginnin g to realize his 
error and to understand that the world he  lives in is one of psychic images  the east is wiser for it finds 
the essence of all things grounded in the psyche between the unknown essences of spirit and matter

consciousness is the source of all problems only the second and third of the four stages of life youth 
and middleage are discussed the development of consciousness in the individual is traced from 
biological birth to psychic birth whic h is said to occur at puberty it is  found to consist of three stages 
the recognition of connections be tween two events the development of the ego complex and the 
awareness of the selfs dual nature  youth the sec ond stage of life is defined as th e years between 
puberty and the onset of middleage at age  to  during this stage ones personality and place in 
society are established at this st age problems revolve around  either the individual s refusal to leave the 
conscious state of childhood or the crushing loss of cherished illusions through the contradiction of 
expectations of reality at the onset of middleag e mans values and even his body begin to change 
toward their opposites neurotic dist urbances in adults all have one thing in common the individuals 
attempt to carry over the psychology of youth into middleage he must however change his 
psychology or else risk damaging his soul middleage is seen to have a cultural purpose as opposed to 
the individual purpose of youth it is theorized that the value of religi ous beliefs in the supramundane is 
that they constitute a basis for livi ng the second half of life with as mu ch purpose and aim as the first it

the meaning of death is discussed in  terms of its relation to the psyche  the view that death is simply 
the end of life the period placed af ter an often uncompleted sentence is countered by the view of death 
as the goal of life life is said to be an energy pro cess that has rest as its goal its curve is parabolic 
during youth it ascends it reaches its zenith at middleage then it si nks to the valley from which the 
ascent began mans problems begin when his psycholog ical curve is out of phase with his biological 
curve it is argued that this conception of death is not a mere syllogism on the grounds that since man 
grants purpose and meaning to the ascent of life he s h ould also grant them to lifes descent it is stated 
that the c onsensus of the race as expressed in the great  religions of the world is that there is some sort 
of continuation of life after death in the west how ever religious belief has been devalued since the 
enlightenment religions have come to be viewed as philosophical systems as c onstructs of the intellect 
that amount to no more than a wish fulfilling fant asy this view is countered by the contention that 
religious symbols arc the products of the natural life of  the unconscious and as such they are at least the 
essential truths of mans psychological nature a fi nal account of the meaning of death is held to be 
beyond the scope of an empirical sc ience and the capabilities of the human intellect telepathy and the 
various phenomena of parapsychology are discussed as presenting eviden ce that the psyche is capable 
of transcending the spacetime cont inuum it is concluded that the ps yche has a form of exvitericc

the concept of synchronicity as an acausal connecti ng principle is formulated and discussed evidence 
for the existence of complexes of noncausally yet meaningfully related events is presented this 
evidence was developed by a survey and discussion of intuitive or mantic methods such as the 
iching astrology and alchemy all of which take the ex istence of synchronicity for granted a scientific 
rationale for accepting acausal e xplanatory principles is provide d by modern physics which has 
demonstrated that natural laws and their philos ophical underpinning of causal ity are relative and only 
statistically valid though acausal combinations of even ts are hard to detect in the macrophysical world 
there still exists a wealth of hist orical writings on the subj ect reference is made to a text by albertus 
magnus circa  and to schopenhauers treatise on the apparent design in the fate of the 
individual among many others de cisive evidence for synchronicity is found in j b rhines book 
extrasensory perception his psyc hokinetic telepathic experiments are examined in detail and it is 
concluded that they reveal events which are related to one another experimentally and meaningfully but 
not causally furthermore his experi ments indicate that in relation to the psyche space and time are 
elastic several case histories fr om the authors clinical experien ce are presented to illustrate the 
psychological significance of synchroni city from these it is deduced that  synchronicity consists of two 
factors an unconscious image that comes into cons ciousness either directly or indirectly and an 
objective situation that coincides with this content  references

of a marriage partner to  test this hypothesis the horoscopes of  married couples were plotted and 
then analyzed for the frequency of the conjunction and or opposition of certain  preselected astrological 
characteristics the results showed that the figures for all the analyzed characteristics fell well within the 
limits of probability their varian ce however corresponded surprisingly we ll with the psychic states of 
the individual subjects this difference between the mass statistical result and the individual results is

synchronicity  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  nd ed princeton university press 
  p p   
the intellectual history that forms the basis fo r the concept of synchronicity is examined the 
fundamental idea underlying th e concept of meaningful coincidence i e synchronicity is that all things 
contain a latent rationality this la tent rationality derives from the interconnection of all things and 
manifests itself in the explanatory principles of cau sality and synchronicity the existence of this second 
explanatory principle alongside causal ity is traced through the primitive classical and medieval views 
of nature passages from texts by theophrastus ph ilo hippocrates pico agrippa and zoroaster are 
analyzed for their references to the s ympathy of all thin gs the principle of universal connection 
numerous parallels between these vi ews and classical chinese philosophy as epitomized in the concept 
of the tao are drawn leibnizs theory of the pr eestablished harmony between both the inside and the 
outside of the monad betwee n psychic and physical events  is seen as the flower ing of this philosophical 
tradition causality alone however was accepted first by th e natural sciences in the th century and 
then by the physical sciences in the th as a valid e xplanatory principle the pr inciple of synchronicity 
would have vanished altogether had not the invest igation of telepathic phenomena opened the question 
again synchronicity therefore has been revive d by psychology to explain those events which though 
relatively rare are not amenable to explanat ion by the causality prin ciple  references

the value of synchronicity as an explanatory princi ple and its impact on our c onception of the world are 
discussed it is argued that the coordination of ps ychic and physical processes in a living organism can 
be better understood as a synchronistic phenomenon than  as a causal relation several medical cases that 
involved the continuation of conscious processes duri ng swoon states are detaile d the continuation of 
conscious processes during periods of  cortical depression is interprete d as indicating that the mind and 
the body exist as an acausal orderedness outside the realm of psychophysical pa rallelism which it is 
admitted is not really understood synchronicity is not easily demo nstrated the findings of modem 
physics especially in the area of radioactive decay suggest that the concept of acausal orderedness 
may replace causality as the principle underlying the ul timate laws of nature the idea of synchronicity 
with its inherent quality of meani ng produces a view of the world that is at first baffling but added to 
the trinity of space time and causality it makes pos sible a view which include s the psychoid factor in 
our description and knowledge of nature when this c onceptual schema is modified into the quaternion 
of constant connection through effect causality i ndestructible energy the spacetime continuum and

contained in synch ronicity an acausal connecting principle sync hronicity is defined and several 
personal anecdotes that illustrate the concept are rec ounted the experiments of j  b rhine in telepathic 
phenomena and an astrological experiment are reviewed in detail it is demonstrated that they provide 
empirical evidence for the usefulness of synchronicity as  an explanatory principle it is concluded that 
synchronistic phenomena prove the simultaneous occurrence of meaningful equivalences in 
heterogeneous causally unrelated processes

the possibility of applying the pr inciples used in measuring physic al energy to the measurement of 
psychic energy is discussed although both the mech anisticcausal and energyfinal viewpoints are 
required to explain psychic events the decision to use one or the other view point is determined by 
expediency iethe possibi lity of obtaining results the question of  whether or not the energic point of 
view is even applic able to psychic phenomena at all is rais ed along with the question of whether the 
psyche can be looked upon as a rela tively closed system although thes e questions are controversial 
they are answered in the affirmative in order to apply the energic standpoint to psychology it is assumed 
that a quantitative estimate of psychic ener gy is possible this assum ption is based on the theor y that the 
psyche actually possesses an extraordinarily well deve loped evaluatory system namely the system of 
psychological values an objective poi nt of departure for estimating comparative value intensities is 
presented complexes are defined as  constellations of psychic elem ents grouped around feeling toned 
contents or complexes these are said to consist of  a nuclear element and a la rge number of secondarily 
constellated associations the obj ective estimate of psychological value intensities is based on the 
assumption that the constellating power  of the nuclear element corresponds to its value intensity ieto 
its energy three experimental methods for estimati ng the energic value of the constellating power are 
given in addition it is noted that  a highly differentiated subjec tive system for recognizing and 
evaluating affective phenomena in others is present in everyone  references  
 the structure of the psyche  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  nd ed 
princeton university press   p p   
the structure of the psyche  is examined from the viewpoint of a practicing psychologist as opposed to 
that of a researcher the contents of consciousness are classified into seven groups sense perception the 
processes of instinct evaluation recognition intuition  volition and dreams the last five of these are 
apperceptive produced by a configur ation of psychic not physical processes the psyche is not 
composed wholly of consciousness its other si de is the unconscious which is not accessible to 
observation and can only be inferred from phenomena such as dreams slips of the tongue and various 
pathological states it is believed th at all activities ordinarily taking place in the consciousness can also 
proceed in the unconscious an example of this is dr eams the most important and most obvious results 
of the unconscious intruding upon the conscious both analytical technique and a knowledge of 
mythology are deemed necessary for understanding a dream this know ledge enables one to grasp the 
meaning of a content deriving from the deepest le vels of the psyche th e collective unconscious 
evidence for the existence of the collective unconsciou s is found in several clinical cases it is also 
reflected in the existence of several religious beliefs  especially in early and medieval christianity the 
collective unconscious consists of archetypes primordial images th at are more or less fantastic 
analogies of regular physical occurrences mans psyche  registers these images rather than the actual 
physical occurrences through the process of particip ation mystique which refers to the lack of 
distinction primitive man makes be tween subject and object the func tion of consciousness is seen not 
only as the recognition and a ssimilation of the external world through the senses but also the translation 
into visible reality of the world within us the unconscious  reference  
 instinct and the unconscious  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  nd ed 
princeton university press   p p   
the terms instinct and the unconscious are defined and a dist inction is made between unconscious 
processes and instinctive reactions a re view of the historical views of instinct is provided and instinct 
is defined as those unconscious processes which are inherited occur uniformly and regularly and are of 
compelling necessity the unconscious is then define d as a totality of all psychic phenomena that lack 
the quality of consciousness its contents are the product of associative activity both personal and the 
collective the latter contains inborn forms of intuition namely archetypes of perception and 
apprehension which determine a priori all psychi c processes archetypes and instinct the two 
components of the collective unconscious are defined and contrasted instincts are defined as typical 
modes of action whether associated with a conscious motive or not ar chetypes are defined as typical 
modes of apprehension whether the my thological character is recognized or  not it is concluded that it is 
impossible to determine whether the apprehension of th e situation or the impulse to act comes first

 psychological factors de termining human behavior  in jung c collected works of c g 
jung vol  nd ed princeton universit y press   p p    
the psychological factors determini ng human behavior are listed and examined chief motivating forces 
among these are the instincts though their characterist ic compulsion is an ectopsychic stimulus they do 
lead to the formation of structures  or patterns that determine psychol ogical behavior psychization the 
instincts hunger sexuality the drive to activity the reflective instinct and creativity are all variable and 
lend themselves to different appli cations in addition to the instinct s there are the six modalities of 
psychic functioning that influence behavior in other wa ys the first three age sex and heredity of the 
individual are primarily p hysiological they are also psychological inasmuch as like the instincts they 
are subject to psychization the other modalities the conscious and the unconscious extraversion and 
introversion and spirit and matter  are considered to determine th e most crucial problems of the 
individual and of society these five  instincts and six modalities are onl y general categories in actuality 
the psyche is a complicated inte rplay of all these factors with a marked tendency to split into 
autonomous parts or complexes that are not necessari ly pathological but are often normal the behavior 
of archetypes in the collective unc onscious is analogous to that of the complexes in the psyche the 
inherent tendency of the psyche to split is inte rpreted to indicate on the one hand a capacity for 
dissociation into multiple structural units a nd on the other hand the capacity for change and 
differentiation of neurosis results fr om the observation that a differentiat ed part of the psyche sometimes 
becomes so powerful that it makes the personality one sided of the four cogniti ve faculties sensation 
thinking feeling and intuition one is usually more developed than th e others giving th e personality its 
characteristic stamp these faculties are contrasted thi nking vs feeling and sensat ion vs intuition it is 
recommended that the problem of oppos ites be made the basis for a critic al psychology all attempts at a 
comprehensive theory will be necessarily incomplete  because of the tremendous complexity of psychic

in a study of the typological method the question of the relations of physical constitution heredity and 
the psyche are examined the psyc he is viewed as relatively inde pendent of the constitution although 
certain physiological peculiarities are seen to determ ine psychic conditions one of the difficulties in 
this or any other psychological research is that ps ychology has yet to invent its own specific language 
accordingly many terms mean  different things to different people  one factor not presently considered 
by those investigating the constitu tion is that the psychic process does not originate in individual 
consciousness but is rather a repetition of functions  that have evolved over the ages and which are 
inherited along with brain st ructure this gives rise to primordial  images or archetypes which make up 
the collective unconscious in acknowledging the existence of the collective unconscious pure 
psychology is confronted by organic factors both the collective uncons cious and the constitutional type 
are outside the control of the conscious mind neglect  of either leads to pat hological disturbance and 
therefore both are given attention in  therapeutic work  reference

the nature and characteristics of feelingtoned complexes are presen ted and discussed in conjunction 
with methods of experimental ps ychology the problem of assimilation is examined in terms of its 
interference with such experimental methods as asso ciation tests it is show n that the experimental 
situation was disturbed by th e autonomous behavior of the psyche this leads to the conclusion that it is 
impossible to examine isolated psychic processes  instead certain conste llations or complexes 
possessing their own psychic energy can be examined especially if there is an awareness of resistance 
techniques used by the subjects to avoid revealing the psychic secret  a complex is described as an 
image of a certain psychic situation which is strongl y accentuated emotionally and is incompatible with 
the habitual attitude of  consciousness this ima ge has a powerful inner coherenc e its own wholeness 
and a relatively high degree of autonomy the feelingtoned comple x is compared to the splinter 
psyches described by psychopathologists such as janet prin ce it is considered to be certain their origin 
springs from a socalled trauma an emotional shock for instance that sp lits off a bit of the psyche since 
complexes produce such strong fear reactions the cons cious mind attempts to abolish them by declaring 
them unreal or imagina ry primitive man appears to have recognized the strength of the autonomy o f 
complexes in that he posited the exis tence of demons as beings in th eir own right when primitive magic 
means of apotropaic gestur es and euphemisms fail to mask the comp lex dissociative neurosis breaks out 
and attempts to assimilate the ego consciousness freuds concept that the dream is the key to the 
unconscious is regarded as  limited the jungian theory posits the complex as the architect of both 
dreams and symptoms despite the fact that both historically a nd culturally complexes were 
recognized it has been difficult to regard them as characteristic expre ssions of the psyche the theory of 
feelingtoned complexes is seen to arouse appr ehension because these disturbing vestiges of the 
primitive state of mind are not yet understood  
 the transcendent function  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  nd ed 
princeton university press   p p   
the transcendent function which aris es from the union of the consci ous and unconscious attitudes is 
examined within the context of psychoanalytic pract ice it is called transcendent because it makes 
organically possible the transition fro m one attitude to the other without loss of either one modern life 
demands a kind of functioning which entails the risk of considerable  dissociation from the unconscious 
in discussing the aim and technique of therapy it is stated that the reconciliation of the conscious and 
the unconscious is not an attempt at a permanent cu re but rather at a psychological readjustment the 
basic question for the therapist is not how to get rid of momentary di fficulties but how to help the 
patient successfully counter future difficulties by means of transfer ence the patient may cling to the 
therapist who seems to promise him a renewal of a ttitude in the transcendent function the unconscious 
material must be brought to light because it exerci ses a regulatory influence th at is necessary to our 
mental and physical health there ar e several sources for this unconsci ous material the most useful for 
the constructive method of therapy being spontaneous fantasies the patient must give himself over to 
his mood and give form to his fant asies and other associations by wri ting visualizing or some form of 
artwork the energy which the patient should have at his disposal to remedy the state of reduced 
adaptation is found in the intensity of the emotional disturbance itself accordi ng to his personality the 
patient will stress either creative formulation or intellectual unde rstanding of his unconscious material 
the opposite ego and the unconscious mu st be reconciled in order to  bring about the transcendent 
function at this stage it is no longer the unconscious  that takes the lead but the ego both sides 
however must be considered equally for the regulat ing factors to exert an influence on actions the 
value of this transcendent  function derives from the fact that it  provides a way for the patient to break 
the dependence on the therapist and to at tain liberation by his own efforts

idea of energy the almost universal incidence of the primitive concept of energy is a clear expression o f 
the fact that at early levels of human consciousness man felt the need to represent the sensed dynamism 
of psychic events in a concrete way it is ther efore concluded that the energic point of view in

symbol formation is presented as a bridge between mans instinctual and spiritual natures the symbols 
primitive man formed through analogue  building are examined and evalua ted as an important means of 
utilizing instinctual energy for ef fective work since only a small pa rt of mans total energy can be 
diverted from its natural flow most of it is not used up in symbol formation but goes to sustain the 
regular course of life which consis ts of both instinctual and cultural functions the transformation of the 
libido through symbols has occurred since the begi nnings of humanity symbol s were and are never 
devised consciously but always uncon sciously it is more than probabl e that most of the historical 
symbols derive directly from dreams or are at least influenced by them this is evident in the symbol 
formation consistently encountered in patients the two opposite forces nature a nd spirit are considered 
to exist together in the psyche and to be responsib le for its selfregulation nature corresponds to the 
primitive mentality that freud cal led infantile sexuality freud is criticized for not recognizing that 
spirit is an equivalent counterforce to instinct he is  praised however for recognizi ng that instinct is the 
sine qua non of psychic energy the c onflict between ethics and sex toda y is analyzed as a struggle to 
give instinct its rightful place as a creative power in our lives in a discussion of religion the concept of 
one god paradoxically both a creator and judge is an  expression of a profou nd psychological truth in 
its tension of opposites a truth that defies logic the function of all re ligions is viewed as providing a 
spiritual counterforce to instinctua lity in the first half of life wi th its biological and instinctual 
orientation man can usually afford  to expand his life the older ma n on the other hand is oriented 
toward culture since the diminish ing powers of his organism allow hi m to subordinate his instincts to 
cultural goals it is observed that there is an almo st total lack of guidance for this extraordinarily 
important transformation of ener gy from the biological to the cultural form  references

 p p   
the canalization of libido is  defined as a transfer of psychic inte nsities or values from one content to 
another a process corresponding to  the physical transformation of energy examples chosen from 
primitive customs and ceremonies ill ustrate this process human culture is seen as the machine that 
provides for the canalization of li bido as well as of mankinds physi cal and chemical energy it is 
described as the means by which in stincts are made productive the tr ansformation of in stinctual energy 
is achieved by its canalization into an analogue of the object of instinct an analogy is drawn to the 
manner in which a power station imitat es a waterfall to gain  possession of its energy in order to explain 
how the psychic mechanism imitates the instinct and is thereby enabled to apply its energy for special 
purposes primitive man used complicated ceremonies to accomplish the canaliz ation of libido modem 
man does this by an act of will besides succeedi ng in taming external nature man has succeeded in 
taming his internal nature to some extent it is observed that only sli ght threats to present conditions are 
needed to revive the magical ceremonies of our ancestors

the progression and regression of li bido are defined their interrelat ion is described and they are 
analyzed in terms of the flow of  energy progression implies the conti nual satisfaction of the demands of 
environmental conditions during progr ession pairs of opposite attitudes in the psyche are united in the 
coordinated flow of psychi c processes during a conflict the pairs of opposing forces attempt to repress 
each other if this repression occu rs it obstructs the progression of th e libidio and regression sets in the 
stalemated conscious opposites devalue one another an d there is an increase in the value of all those 
psychic processes which are not concerned with adaptation and therefore are seldom or never 
consciously employed the unconscious begins to infl uence the conscious as is evident in behavior 
disturbances during regre ssion incompatible and rejected remnan ts of everyday life as well as 
inconvenient and objectionable animal  tendencies rise to the surface  at first glance these elements 
appear to be undesirable however they contain the possibilities of  new life for they can reverse the 
stoppage of the libido caused by the failure of the c onscious attitude regression then is not essentially 
a retrograde step but rather a necessary developmenta l phase frobeniuss myth of the whale dragon is 
used to illustrate the principles of progression and regression and an argument is presented to defend the 
validity of using myths in support of psychologica l principles it is noted that progression is a 
continuous process of adaptation to environmen tal conditions regression on the other hand is an 
adaptation to the conditions of the inner world to  the demands of individuation man is capable of 
adapting to either set of conditions only when he is  in harmony with both from the energic standpoint 
progression and regression are transitional stages  in the flow of energy which by allowing a 
manifestation of the inner world in the outer  enable man to adapt to his conditions

to an understanding of the diff erences between energism and dyna mism dynamism corresponds to the

dynamism from the causal effect observed while the second observes the equivalence of the 
transformed effect rather than the effect of a cause  the concept of libido is clarified and related to the

entropy as important as equivalence in the practical application of th e theory of energy to psychology

an equalization of differences th e principle of entropy is applicable  to psychic energy examples from

the necessity of testing the appli cability of the energic standpoint to psychic life progress by using 
empirical evidence and by submitting it to the prin ciple of conservation of energy is affirmed the 
differences between the principles of equivalence a nd constancy are noted the principle of equivalence 
which freud demonstrated clearly in his investigation of the transforma tion of a given quantum of libido 
into another psychic force is the only one necessary to empirical studies the equivalence principle is of 
great heuristic value in the treatment of neuroses as is shown by examples given the analogy with the 
theory of physical energy is further expanded by a di scussion of the factors of  intensity and extensity 
the latter is defined as the dynamic measure of en ergy present at any time in a given phenomenon the 
energic viewpoint is also used to show how fre uds causal view of psychology iereducing everything 
to its sexual component inadequately explains the im portant idea of final deve lopment here again the 
conflict between the mechanistic causal and energicfinal views is evident although both are necessary 
to explain development the process of regression is  used to illustrate the differences in the two 
viewpoints what is fact to the causa l view is symbol to the final view and vice versa everything that is 
real and essential to the one is unr eal and inessential to the other it is suggested therefore that this 
conflict be resolved by the anti nomian postulate since the psyche possesses both points of view

  p p   
the term psychic energy as it appeared in the writings of schiller li pps von grot and stem is 
presented and the jungian definition of this concept is discussed the difficulties of delimiting this 
concept are explained as stemming from an inability to  separate psychic from bi ological processes it is 
hypothesized that it would be better to enlarge the narrower concept of psychi c energy to a broader one 
of life energy this fife energy of which psychic energy is a specific part is called libido this 
expanded definition expedites the st udy of quantitative relations and the discussion of mind and body 
it is concluded that in all probability the psychi c and the physical are not two independent parallel 
processes but are essentially connected through reci procal action although the actual nature of this 
relationship is still completely beyond experience  references
