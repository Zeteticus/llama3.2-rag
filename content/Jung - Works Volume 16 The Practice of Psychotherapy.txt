psychotherapy is defined as a kind of dialectic pr ocess a dialogue and discussion between two persons 
the various schools of thought on psyc hotherapy are examined and it is concluded and that their variety 
does not necessarily invali date their divergent premises the in terdependence of psyche and body is 
established as a basic theoretical principle initially the psychothera pist cannot judge the whole of his 
patients personality although the patient can be  seen as approximating the universal man his 
individuality is his own and mu st be allowed expression without  being hampered by the doctors 
assumptions since the individual signi fies nothing in comparison with  the universal and the universal 
signifies nothing in comparison with the individua l methods such as suggestion and  mana the 
universal healing power can have some success this success however is believed to be limited by the 
contradictions of the individual universal antinomy psychoneuroses can be divided into two main 
groups collective types with underdeveloped personali ty and individualists with atrophied collective 
adaptation therapists are cautioned to treat th eir patients in accordan ce with the unique and 
unpredictable individuality of  the latter the cure should not alter the patients personality but lead to 
individuation it is noted that the dialectic procedure calls for the most unbiased attitude possible on the 
part of the therapist who is a fellow participant in the therapeutic discourse w ith his patient freuds 
concept of depth dimension logically resulted in th e involvement of the doctor s own personality as well 
as that of the patient in the psychotherapy treatment because the conscious attit ude of the neurotic must 
be balanced by compensatory or complementary c ontents from the unconscious the continuity of 
dreams a source of unconscious content is stressed in a  month dream series  for example a water 
motif symbolic of the collective unconscious was recurrent another dream series centered around 
various forms of woman representing the mythological personification of the unc onscious the anima 
it is justifiable to resort to mythological ideas to a ssist the patient religious beliefs are viewed as forms 
of psychotherapy which treat and heal the suffering of the soul and the suffering of the body caused by 
the soul since many patients do not have such be liefs for them dialectic developments of the 
mythological material within them is indicated vari ous types of people for whom  different treatment is 
required are distinguished aim of the therapeutic proc ess is to enable the patient to assimilate the 
unconscious elements in his psyche thus achieving th e ultimate integration of  his personality and the 
removal of the neur otic dissociation

the nature of psychotherapy as a science requiring the use of scient ific methods and new forms of 
treatment is discussed a glance at former methods  shows that suggestion therapy had given way and 
that freuds demands that the caus es of neuroses be brought to cons ciousness were heeded the trauma 
theory originally inte nded to explain the cause of neuroses is re jected as a hasty generalization and it is 
shown that even freud abandoned this theory for th at of repression it became evident that modern 
psychotherapy cannot be generally applied but must give undivided and general attention to the 
individual this theory goes beyond freudian psychoanalysis and adle rs individual psychology in that 
it emphasizes the need for more extensive individualiz ation in the method of treatment the doctor is 
cautioned to avoid influencing the patient in the dire ction of his own bents for only when a man lives in 
his own way can he be responsible and capable of  action methods of treatment recommended show 
that in all clear cases of neuroses reeducation a nd regeneration of personality are essential it is 
considered essential that modern  psychotherapeutic methods take into account the philosophy of the 
humane sciences and be based on a thorough knowledge of psychiatry for ade quate study of dreams a 
study of primitive psycholo gy com parative m ytholo gy and reli gion is re quired

freuds theories concerning the unconscious are ex amined and evaluated his assumption that bringing 
the causes of neuroses into consciousness will cure th em is rejected as is hi s view that dreams are a 
facade instead dreams are considered to be a reflect ion of basic elements in an individuals psyche and 
regression to childhood is seen as a sign of a patients efforts to find himself the negative conception of 
the unconscious held by freud is rejected in favor of the belief that the unconsci ous is a creative factor 
as well as the stronghold of ancestral conservatism  by discerning the true reasons for his childhood 
longings and by penetrating the wide realm of the coll ective psyche the patient is enabled to enter into 
the healthy and natural matrix of the human mind  
 general problems of psychother apy the aims of psychotherapy  in jung c collected 
works of c g jung vol  nd ed princet on university press   p p   
divergent opinions concerning the st ructure of neuroses and principl es of therapy are examined and 
compared to those derived from clinical observations of  patients although freuds explanation of 
neurosis in terms of sexual causation and adlers view point based on the will to power are considered to 
correspond to psychic realities neve rtheless their methods cannot be applied indiscriminately because 
individual life is extraordinarily diverse the psychotherapist is exhor ted to abandon too fixed an aim and 
to be aware of the patients own unconscious nature and will to live a distinction is made between 
young patients who must shape their conscious e go and older ones who are more concerned with 
understanding the meaning of their inner life dream an alysis is recommended when rational methods of 
treatment are not successful since  though not scientific it provides a practical method of showing the 
patient the trend of his unconscious it is deemed necessary for the doctor to know as much as possible 
about primitive psychology mythology archaeology and comparative religion in order to enrich the 
associations of his patients by analogy fantasy the maternally creative side of the masculine mind is 
judged to be bound to the taproot of hum an and animal instinct therefor e it is considered valid to 
encourage the patient in his fantasies without going beyond the meaning which is effective for the 
patient painting is encouraged not for the sake of art but in order to aid in the development of 
independence and psychological maturity freeing the pa tient from dependence on dreams or the doctors 
knowledge painting alone is not sufficient however it must be accompanied by synthetic interpretation 
that will allow the patient in co llaboration with the doctor to at tain intellectual and emotional 
understanding the problems of dealing with this proce ss of psychic life that lies outside consciousness 
are stressed since psychic reality is not commensu rate with conscious real ity the observation of the 
psyche can only be indirect yet it is this independe nt psychic reality that th e therapist must plumb

the use of the term psychoa nalysis to describe many different approaches to the study and treatment of 
the psyche is discussed and altern ate therapeutic methods such as fr eudian psychoanalysis adlerian 
individual psychology medical psyc hology and analytical psychology are examined the diversity of 
professional opinions implied by the various methods i ndicates the difficulty inherent in gaining access 
to the psyche analytical psyc hology is defined as embracing both psychoanalysis and individual 
psychology this approach includes four stages c onfession elucidation educ ation and transformation 
each of these stages is subsequently analyzed in the first stage the secrets or inhibited emotions 
analogous to repressed sins that lead to neuroses must  be confessed to enable the patient to regain his 
wholeness and his dependence on the doctor transference must be severed next the elucidation of this 
transference must take place and the patients fixa tion analyzed the theories of freud and adler are 
examined in their relation to this sta ge the im portance of drawin g the patient out of himself in a 
process of education in order to atta in normal adaptation is stressed th e fourth stage transformation is 
seen to affect both pati ent and doctor whose personalities have  interacted throughout the treatment 
emphasis is placed on the doctors need to engage in selfeducation and to understand that both he and 
the patient are in search of a cure that i nvolves not just the body but the entire psyche  
 general problems of psychotherapy ps ychotherapy and a philosophy of life  in jung c 
collected works of c g jung vol  nd ed princeton university press   p p   
the theme that the psyche must be treated with sufficient  attention given to phys iological and spiritual 
factors is expanded the difficulty of the psychotherape utic task lies in the concept that the psyche 
influenced by both physiological and psychological factor s has a contradictory structure giving rise to 
the problem of opposites this problem once brought to consciousness is seen as capable of threatening 
the philosophy of life of both therapist and patient since mans philosophy of life the most complex of 
psychic structures forms the counterpose to the physiologically conditioned psyche it ultimately 
determines ones fate hence the psychotherapist need s to have well developed valid convictions of his 
own yet be open to search with the patient for th e latters religious and philosophical ideas both 
religious and philosophical convictions are consider ed extremely valuable for the psychotherapeutic 
process especially the christian view of original sin and suffering in an analysis  of a patients neurosis 
the psychotherapist is advised to explore both prechri stian and nonchristian conc epts in order to deal 
with archetypal symbolism in the unconscious the ps ychotherapist is enjoined to be aware that the 
neurosis is not a separate thing but  rather the whole of the pathologically dist urbed psyche hence it is 
not the neurosis but the whol e man who should be treated

in a  meeting of the swiss academy of medical science the difference s between medicine and 
psychotherapy are analyzed the three stages of medi cal procedure  anamnesi s diagnosis and therapy 
are examined and compared to psychotherapeutic  procedures in psychotherapy anamnesis the 
reconstruction of historical facts in the case must be supplemented by a consideration of the patients 
whole environment accordingly the psychotherapi sts task involves asking questions seemingly 
unrelated to the patients psychoneurosis and applying his professional skill and his intuition to draw out 
facts about an illness that involves the whole man in contrast to medical cases diagnosis is considered 
irrelevant since in psychotherapy th e discovery of facts does not lay th e basis for specific treatment but 
only gives indications of the direc tion therapy should take recognition of disease rests much less on the 
clinical picture than on the content of complexes every psychotherapist not only has his own method  
he himself is that method the subject of psychothera py unlike that of medicine is not the disease but 
the human being psychically defined these views lead  to the important conclusion that the real and 
authentic psyche is the unconscious whereas ego consciousness can be regarded only as an 
epiphenomenon the belief that there are certain prenat al modes of behavior a nd function which bear on 
the individual psyche as indicated by the recurr ence of common themes in mythology and other 
folklore is discussed and it is determined that neuroses must be considered by the psychotherapist 
according to their connection with in stinctual disturbances and their situ ational patterns it is concluded 
that psychotherapy must go beyond medical symptomato logy since it deals with the psyche behind the 
symptoms and requires knowledge gained from humane sc iences as well as from natural sciences

c g jung vol  nd ed princeton university press   p p   
the relationship between th e individual psyche and the suprapersona l world of the patient is discussed 
this relationshi p is first ex perienced within the famil y but must be broadened to include the entire world 
into which one must enter as a whole person projecti on the extension of the parental images to the 
whole of external reality is considered to be a majo r cause of neurosis and wi thdrawal of projection of 
the parental image from external reality one of psychotherapys most difficult tasks the recognition of 
the need to facilitate the transition from child to  adult is evident in both primitive and christian 
ceremonies the psychotherapi st is warned that he must reckon wi th the patriarchal orientation of the 
psyche which tradition has encouraged and also guard against transference whereby the patient 
develops too great a dependence on th e doctor it is pointed out that the doctor should take into account 
the patients religious beliefs in orde r to achieve the reintegration of th e latters psyche this process of 
individuation is seen  as the finding of self a goal recognized in both yoga and medieval alchemical 
philosophy the european effort to replace the collectivi ty of the church with the collectivity of the 
state is interpreted as a reflection of the europeans  deep seated longing for a patriarchal order for 
authority the domination of the indi vidual by the state is rejected becau se it deprives the former of his 
rightful destiny ne aim of psychot herapy is stated to educate people towards independence and moral 
freedom to attempt to subject this aim to a par ticular political system is viewed as making 
psychotherapy the tool of totalitarianism the need to  integrate the individual in to society is recognized 
hence extreme individualism is not advocated howeve r it is concluded that the individuation process 
must give free play to nature and that psychoth erapy must be dedicated to the goal of individual 
development  references

c collected works of c g jung vol  nd e d princeton university press    p p   
  
the history of mans exploration of  the psyche from paracelsus to freud is reviewed and the subjective 
element in theories of psychotherapy is noted and i llustrated by reference to freuds rigid insistence on 
the pleasure principle and adlers emphasis on the will  to power in order to avoid too much subjectivity 
in treating his patients th e doctor is urged to undergo analysis h imself to gain a knowledge of his own 
attitudes before treating patients whose attitudes may vary greatly the psychotherapeutic process is 
recognized as a dialectic process in which both patient and doctor will be come deeply and often 
painfully involved since many factors social and external as well as in ternal and unconscious 
influence every man and must be taken into account by the doctor collective trad itional values as well 
as the patients own individuality ar c considered major elements in th e reconstruction of his personality 
within each man there is a superego which may come into conflict with his own psychic system 
thereby creating a neurosis various  types of neuroses are described and the belief that the patient can 
be cured when shown where his conf licts lie is expressed to accompli sh this cure each individuals 
philosophy of life and the compensatory relationship  between the conscious and the unconscious must 
be considered this implies that the main task of the psychotherapist is to unveil the unconscious 
without preconceived ideas since the unconscious is a collective phenomenon whose existence is 
indicated by the reappearance of certain archetypes and mythologems throughout the history of man it 
is concluded that a true understanding of the unconscious  will necessitate a consid eration of the unity of 
the collective unconscious  references

collected works of c g jung vol  nd ed princeton university press   p p   
abreaction is defined its therapeu tic effect evaluated and the transf erence relationship between doctor 
and patient is discussed the value of abreaction ie the reenactment  of a traumatic experience in 
achieving the reintegration of the patients individua lity is questioned instead it is proposed that the 
relationship between doctor and patient has the greatest therapeuti c effect it provides the patient with 
the support needed to overcome the effects of his neuros es it requires the doctor to enter into the psyche 
of his patient probin g deeply into the ori gins of the neuroses in order to la y the groundwork for the 
patients return to reality the strict ly sexual interpretation of  the patients neurosis is regarded as limited 
in its value transference the dependence of the patient on the doctor is seen as a stage that will lead to 
the patients attaining a position of equality with the doctor it is considered important that the patient 
see not only the nature and cause of his neuroses but  also envisage his own psychological goal his own 
growth toward a whole psyche  
 specific problems of psychotherapy the practical use of dreamanalysis  in jung c 
collected works of c g jung vol  nd ed princeton university press   p p   
the rejection of dream analysis by many as a valid method to penetrate the unconscious is 
acknowledged but its practical usefulness is upheld several cases are cited to support the conclusion 
that dreams must be taken as dia gnostically valid facts dreams ar e often anticipatory and provide 
valuable information for understanding the patien t and planning his treatment although the doctor 
himself may regard his patients dr eams as confused he must realize that his confusion ties in his own 
lack of understanding and that a true understanding wi ll be attained when bot h doctor and pa tient reach 
agreement on the dream content as the result of join t reflection suggestion is considered to have serious 
limitations as a therapeutic technique since it can  hamper the patients willingness to face his own 
problems and to make his own judgments and decisi ons the analysis of dreams is preferred because 
the nocturnal unconscious psychic ac tivity covers a wide gamut of conditions and developments they 
require careful interpretation by the doctor however nothing in them is certain but uncertainty for an 
adequate understanding a series of dreams must be an alyzed rather than a si ngle dream taken out of 
context the idea of sublimation proposed by fre ud to save man from the imaginary claws of the 
unconscious is rejected since the unc onscious is not considered to be  any more demoniacal than the 
conscious compensation  the balanc ing of elements in both the cons cious and the unconscious  is 
considered to be a basic law of psychic behavior unconscious compensation is only effective when it 
cooperates with an integral consci ousness however the valu es of the conscious personality must remain 
intact the belief that the patients philosophical re ligious and moral convictions must be taken into 
account is reiterated the conclusi on is drawn that dream s reveal more clearly the evolutionary 
stratification of the psyche than does the conscious mind and th at assimilation of unconscious contents 
can lead the conscious mind back to the natural state of the patients own being  reference

the problem of transference is revi ewed and discussed in terms of alchemical symbolism in order to 
provide some orientation in the study of the unconsci ous mystic marriage coniunctio which played an 
important part in alchemy and wa s concerned both with chemistry and a kind of mystic philosophy is 
discussed since it sheds light on the mystery of chemic al combination and is related to transference in 
psychology the history of this symbolism is outlined b ecause of its usefulness in the exploration of the 
unconscious the complexity of transfer ence a partly instinctive process difficult to weigh is analyzed 
and the danger inherent in taking over the patient s psychic sufferings is mentioned the incestuous 
aspect in transference is recognized and is descri bed as a flurry of unleashed opposites within the 
awakened unconscious that must be reconciled thes e assaults of the unconscious are symbolized in 
alchemy by mercurius who is both friend and pa nacea good and evil religions particularly 
christianity are considered to be great psychotherapeutic systems mode rn mans hostility to religion is 
considered as increasing the danger of dissociati on between the ego conscious and the unconscious the 
many analogies that exist between alchemical symbols and the study of the unconscious show that the 
study of this medieval speculative philosophy and science can shed great light on the process of 
individuation and the analysis of  the unconscious  references

illustration contains the alchemical symbols of quatern ity  the four elements which merge into a fifth 
entity the quinta essentia the circular  basin and the seven planets this last symbol evokes the image o f 
mercurius the mother of all seven since he is also  his own mother and father  the three essences of 
mercurius are represented by the serpent the sun a nd moon appear above the tr iad as the indispensable 
parents of the mystic transformation the progression from  to  to  to  the alchemical axiom of 
maria represents four mutually antagonistic tende ncies that must be reduced to a final unity the 
quaternity one of the most widespread archetypes represents the arrangement  functions by which the 
conscious mind takes its bearings the circle expresse s the primordial image of man and the soul and the 
number four stands for the pluralistic state of a ma n who has not yet attained inner unity the triad the 
agent of upwelling appears as masc uline the dyad as feminine psyc hologically the triad represents 
desire instinct and determination while the dyad corresponds to the psyches reaction to the conscious 
minds decision the water signifying the unconscious repr esents the ebbing and fl owing of the circle of

mans dark unconscious side and to the dubious natu re of the affective relationship heavenly and 
earthly as well as incestuous the right hands holding flowers appear compensatory the  
arrangement of the flowers represent fire and air as the active masculine element water and earth as the 
passive feminine element with the fifth flower as the quinta essent ia although the symbols in this 
illustration all emphasize nature a hidden spiritual meani ng is also suggested as is the triple nature of 
mercurius  masculine feminine and divine  w ho was seen as the earthbound partner of the holy 
ghost who wards against the ominous darkness of na tures secrets mercurius is beyond sex in a state 
reached only when male and female come together into one the concept of anthropos is viewed as an 
eternal idea present in various cultur es the love factor in the illustrati on a love with a sinister touch of 
incest is analyzed and the conclusion is drawn that  incest symbolizes union with ones own being  
individuation or becoming a self by  means of several diagrams the co mplex nature of projection and 
transference that occur in the doctor patient psychotherapeutic relationship is analyz ed the doctors task

two can only be united in the soul a hermaphroditic being symbolized by the mixture of oil and water
