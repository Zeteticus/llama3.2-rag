freuds exposition of the incest fa ntasy which he derived from the oedipus legend is proposed as an 
example of classical legends whic h express basic psychological concep ts and which can be more fully 
understood and appreciated through the exploration of these concepts the works of riklin rank 
abraham maeder jones silberer and pfister are ment ioned as contributing clues in historical research 
that furnish insights into the unconscious of modern man as the study of the activity of the unconscious 
in modern man can expand the understanding of the psychology of historical problems and symbolism 
so the reverse procedure a comp arative study of historic al material would shed light on individual 
psychological problems of today it is in this persp ective of gaining new insight into the foundations of 
psychology that the study of histor ical material is proposed  
 two kinds of thinking  in jung c collected works of c  g jung vol  nd ea princeton 
university press   p p   
the concept of ontogenetic reca pitulation of phylogenetic psychol ogy is explained by showing the 
relation between mans unconsciou s or nondirected thought and my thology or legend two types of 
human thought are described a dire cted thinking of which the highest  form is science and which is 
based on speech and a nonverbal undirected asso ciative thinking commonl y called dreaming these 
two modes of thought deal with tw o activities of man adapting to  outer reality and reflecting on 
subjective concerns u ndirected thought is seen as characteristic  of ancient cultures of primitive man 
and of children the parallels that are drawn between  the mythological thinking of  the ancients and that 
of children and primit ives or that found in dreams lead to th e supposition that there is a correspondence 
between ontogenesis or individual deve lopment and phylogenesis or the racial development of man in 
psychology an examination of certain fairy tales and myths illustrates the concept that what is in 
modern man an unexpressed fantasy was once an accepte d custom or belief the source of fantasy in the 
individual is described as an attempt at compensation exemplifie d by the adolescent who dreams of 
belonging to wealthy important parents a fantasy found in myths and legends such as romulus and 
remus or in the story of moses through the fantas ies directed thinking comes into contact with the 
product of the unconscious although not with its motiva tion for example in anatole frances story 
abbe oeggers unconscious motivation to become a judas led to his study of the judas legend and 
formulation of the concept of a me rciful god which motivated him to leave the catholic church it is 
concluded that fantasies experienced  in adult life reflect not only individual conflict s but archaic 
patterns as well and that any interpretation of fa ntasy should be based upon both aspects of the fantasy 
mechanism  references

flournoys publication of the recorded fantasies of a miss miller illus trates the autosuggestibility and 
suggestive influence of this young woman of the complicated fantasy system she presents a few 
detailed examples illustrate how her fantasies expressed her own imme diate conflicts these conflicts 
plus the psychic energy provided by her detachment from reality are consid ered the source of her 
suggestibility and her tendency to experience certa in impressions with unusual intensity  references

an analysis of the unconscious conflict which pr oduced miss millers drea m poem the hymn of 
creation and an inquiry into the pur pose this dream served for her lead s to an investigation of the place 
of god and religion in mans psychic adaptation th e hymn of creation wr itten down by miss miller 
after waking represents a projection of her repressed conflicts over her erotic attraction to a sailor she 
had just met while her own explanation of the conten t of her dream shows her identification with job in 
protesting innocence and attributing all evil to outside sources the role of god as a projected 
archetype of the father and the repository of ma ns problems is discussed relative to religions 
requirements for confession of sins the latter acti vity is seen as keeping conflicts conscious  a 
requirement of psychotherapy love as  a characteristic of god and th e difficulties of distinguishing 
human from spiritual love are analyzed the priest as a representative of the archetype is suggested 
christianity as an inevitable reaction to barbarism  and its functioning for mora l subjugation of the baser 
instincts by alienation from reality and encouragement of abstraction is  contrasted with the mithraic 
nature worship the role of christianity in freeing mans energy for civilization is reviewed with the 
later scientific attitude toward nature which christia nity had made possible by its creed of the 
sovereignty of the idea and the resultant questioning of the realities of christian subjective concepts 
such as soul are analyzed  references  
 the song of the moth  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  nd ed princeton 
university press   p p   
the symbolism underlyi ng miss millers poem the song of the moth is explored in detail and an 
attempt is made to describe miss millers psychol ogical state on the basis of  this symbolism and her 
explanations of the poems content like the hymn of creation this is a dream poem and the same 
complex is being worked out as mi ss miller herself interp rets the longing of the moth for the sun as 
representing the longing of man for god so research on the symbolism of the sun repeats this theme 
the poem is seen to serve the ps ychological purpose of transforming her desire for the man her love 
objective a singer into a desire for god psychic  energy the libido crea tes the god image using 
archetypal patterns leading to the psychic force itself being worshiped as divine this enables man to 
feel divinity within himself giving him an incr eased feeling of importance and power numerous texts 
and references support the symbolism of sun light a nd fire as representations of the divine these 
recurrent concepts are considered to exemplify an ar chetype  not an inherited idea but a disposition of 
man to produce similar ideas by traci ng the historical precedents of the symbols moth and sun it is 
the sun hero for whom miss millers soul moth bum s miss millers death fantasies are seen as 
representative of the ambivalence of the worshipe r toward his passion whose power is both beneficent 
and destructive  references

classic references of the symbolis m referred to in the dream poem  the song of the moth and the 
symbolism of the phallus in legends are discussed in relation to the psychological concept of libido 
references to the sun as an image of god the sun repr esenting the creative power of the soul libido are 
quoted the rationality of sun worship consideri ng mans physical dependence on the sun is pointed 
out quotations from the shvetashvatara upanisha d and the kasha upanishad present phallic symbols 
such as tom thumbs and dwarfs as well as the sun as  divinities similar in potency to the key presented 
faust by mephistopheles all of these symbols are s een as representing the power of the libido the 
phallus particularly representing creati ve divinity these examples serve to illustrate that the libido 
introduced by freud is not exclusively sexual although sexuality is one component of its force ciceros 
definition of libido as unbridled de sire in contrast to will and st augustines broad definition of 
libido are quoted to su pport a wider use of the term  references 
 the concept of libido  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  nd ed princeton 
university press   p p   
freuds original definition of libido is discussed a nd the reasons for modification of the definition are 
presented although freud considered at one time equating libido with interest in general he ultimately 
returned to his original definition of libido as sexua l energy which overflows into the other instincts and 
felt that paranoia could be explained by a loss of libidinal inte rest there is more lacking in the 
schizophrenic than mere erotic interest  what is lost is the whole relation to reality and consequently 
the libido is identified with what is termed psychic energy appetite in its natural state differentiation in 
the human psyche of elemental needs and drives de riving from the reproductiv e instinct has created 
complex psychic functions which are now independent of sexuality this broader energic conception of 
libido is considered to explain the observed fact th at one instinct can be depotentiated in favor of 
another disturbances found in th e sexual sphere in neurosis are thus secondary not primary 
phenomena the loss of reality in schizophrenia th en is not caused by an uncontrolled libido but stems 
from the investment of psychic ener gy in archaic fantasy reality in neurosis is seen as falsified rather 
than lost and the fantasy is of individual rather than  archaic origin a value to man of this investment 
off psychic energy into analogy making is felt to ex ist in the general development of the human mind 
from prehistory to the present  references  
 the transformation of libido  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  nd ed 
princeton university press   p p   
the patterns of regre ssive reactivation of the pr esexual stage in a schizophr enic patient are examined 
and compared with the transformati on of libido associated with fire making and rhythmic movement in 
earlier stages of human development the case hi story demonstrates a regr ession to early rhythmic 
movements such as are found in the rhythmic sucking of infants when libido is still primarily invested 
in the nutritional zone with the tran sformation of libido in the devel oping child this model of rhythmic 
movement is transferred to the zone s of other functions wi th sexuality as its ultimate goal the period 
from birth to the first clearly sexual actions however  is labeled as the presexual stage literature and 
legend provide instances of the relation between th e rhythmic boring activity seen in the patients 
regression and fire making examples  from different periods of hi story and different peoples are 
provided to support the existence of a widespread simi larity between fire maki ng rituals and sexuality 
as sexuality is the psychic component  with the strongest affective tone regressions as well as primitive 
rituals will show analogies to it while they are actu ally derived from a presexual libidinal stage the 
transformation of libido is seen  as presexual as well while fear is undoubtedly involved the 
suppression of libido is based on external and internal  factors rather than on the incest taboo proposed 
by freud the strength for such suppression come s from primordial im ages archetypes with 
characteristically numinous effects indian literature  on fire making the legends of fire coming from the 
mouth references to fire from the mouth in the bible and goethes poetry fusing sound light speech 
and fire are given as examples of the conversion of libido focusing on th e nutritive zone rather than the 
sexual as a point of origin fire symbolism is further discussed in re ferences to the book of daniel the 
bhagavad gita and plato as well as incendiarism and ceremonial fire maki ng fire ceremonies are 
discussed in terms of a paradigm fo r canalizing psychic energy into pr ogressive activity   references  
 the origin of the hero  in jung c collected works of c  g jung vol  nd ed princeton 
university press   p p   
the hero called the finest symbol of the libido is discussed as he appears in mythology legend and 
the dramatic dream of one patient miss miller a pa ssive introversion which rejects an external object 
of love and a concentration of the libido on an internal substitute created by the unconscious is 
considered the source of miss millers vision for mankind in general this interna lization of libidinal 
attention is seen in the cult of th e hero who symbolizes archaic psyc hic power suppressed to conform to 
society this human need is recognized by the catholic  church by providing jesus as a visible hero a 
sought after superman who symbolizes the idea the fo rms and the forces of the soul ramifications of 
the meaning of the sphinx which appear ed in miss millers dream are e xplored and it is concluded that 
it means for her what it did for oedipus the incest danger a masculine figure an aztec emerging from 
the sphinx supports this interpretation and symbolic meanings of the figures dress and appearance are 
discussed the processes of repression and regression which lead to such archetypal figures appearing 
from the unconscious are explained since these produc ts of the unconscious are made of repressed 
infantile material the psychology of the childs interest in excrementa l and anal concerns his confusion 
between creation and defecation and other symbolic meanings are examined the creation of 
personality by the unconscious is explored through th e legend of the wandering jew another figure in 
miss millers dream related lege nd and tradition from christian isla mic and mithraic history are 
reviewed returning to  the symbols of the sun and finding the fi sh as a symbol of renewal and rebirth 
heroes in these references are seen to be simultane ously mortal and immortal regularly the psychic life 
force the libido symbolizes itself in the sun or personifies itself in figures  of heroes with solar 
attributes again a sign of mortality and immortal ity unconscious motivations such as the incest 
problem and desires striving for consciousne ss are briefly discussed  references  
 symbols of the mother and of rebirth  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  
nd ed princeton university press   p p   
through exploration of the symbols for mother and rebirth miss mille rs vision of communication with 
a godhero is interpreted and the cultural importance of canalizatio n of libido through the use of 
symbols is demonstrated in miss millers vision the city  is a maternal symbol as it is in the myth of 
ogyges in hindu mythology and in the bible in thes e myths and in others re ferring to sea journeys 
also found in miss millers vision an  expression of the longing to return to the womb and to become 
immortal through rebirth is found this symbol creating process analyzes the libido and allows it to be 
progressive again at a higher level of  consciousness other symbols of th e mother imago such as water 
wood of life and tree of life are examined and st udied from these examples support is found for the 
contention that the object of desi re is rebirth not incestuous coha bitation the incest taboo provides an 
obstacle forcing canalization upon the libido and spir itualizing it religion aids in systematizing the 
canalization symbolism and symbol fo rmation are viewed as civilizing  and natural with the symbol 
representing a psychological truth though not an extern al one in many maternal symbols the motifs of 
devouring and entwining recur as in the symbol of the tree entwined by a snake this symbol as it 
appears there and in many other myths is interpre ted as an example of the archetypal father opposing 
pure instinctuality it is concluded that incest is a narrow and crude explanat ion for symbol formation 
and that the law which expresses itse lf as the incest prohibition should be interpreted as the impulse to 
domestication with religious systems seen as institutions which organize the instinctual forces of mans 
nature and make them available for higher purposes  references  
 the battle for deliverance from the mother  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol 
 nd ed princeton university press   p p   
in examining miss millers vision of her hero on horse back threatened by an indi an arrow the symbolic 
meanings of the fantasy are explored and the vision  is shown to be an expression of miss millers 
impending need to discard infan tile dependence on her mother the he ro of the vision expresses his 
authors infantile demands and ev en behaves in a feminine way re flecting miss millers continuing 
infantilism and identification with her parent the an alysis is expanded by reviewing the symbolism of 
the horse and the arrow as they appear in mythol ogy drama and poetry wounding of the hero is seen as 
a symbolic piercing of self in which the libido turns in ward to replenish itself as if returning into the 
mother this internalizin g is characterized as occurrin g whenever man faces a difficult phase in his 
struggle for personal independence  from the mother and from the enti re atmosphere of infancy the 
mother image and the maternal archetypes are discus sed with the distinction ma de between the attitudes 
held toward them during the first and second half of life in miss mi llers vision the arrow does not fell 
the hero which indicates that miss miller is not ye t ready to give up the connection with her mother

 the dual mother  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  nd ed princeton 
university press   p p   
miss millers vision of the hero chiwantopel and th e associations she herself suggests with the legends 
of hiawatha siegfried and other heros from religion and mythology are discussed in an expansion of 
the theory of the hero figure chiwantopel seeking a beloved she who understands is an archetype of 
the unconscious itself governed by the mother image si nce miss millers battle is for independence the 
hero enters as a savior figure who does all she cannot  do detailed analyses of hiawatha and siegfried 
support the theory of hero as symbolic of self th e extraordinary circumstances of the heros birth are 
due to being born of a mother wife this dual mother motif results in a dual birth one mortal the other 
quasi divine in the struggle death and rebirth of the hero one sees the symbol of  the struggle of the self 
against the attraction of returning to the unconscious  mother while religion and society condemn and 
attempt to block this regressive re turn it is strongly recommended that  therapy support it for it is not an 
incestuous return to the mother but a regression to  the presexual wholeness of the unconscious this 
conflict between the ego conscious and the unconscious is observed to be at the source of the typical 
representation of the hero as ca rrying on an unending struggle against hazardous and evil forces that 
the hero and his adversary often resemble each other is  seen as a symbol of their relationship as two 
parts of the same whole similarly the treasure which is the goal of many legendary heros is seen as life 
itself the resolution of the struggle between conscious and unconscious through introversion the 
entering of the cave the treasureself is regainedr e born a similar interpretati on of dreams is suggested 
since the hero myth as an unconscious dr ama is in fact a kind of dream  
 the sacrifice  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  nd ed princeton 
university press   p p   
by comparing miss millers mental attitude with that of the poet holderlin and with many religious 
legendary and mythological sources the meaning of th e death of the hero chiwantopel is derived miss 
millers conscious mind is seen as threatened by an invasion from the unconscious were the invasion 
completed the conscious mind would be freed to brea k inertia and move forward a similar situation is 
detailed in the poetry of holderlin particularly in hi s increasing estrangement fr om reality this material 
is used to discuss regression as involuntary in troversion of which depression is an unconscious 
compensation holderlins poems are further used to ill ustrate regression as a link with primal material 
which must be assimilated  by the conscious mind lest it keep it s chaotic form producing schizophrenia 
references to the sacrificial death and resurrection of christ illustrate  the poets similarity in thought to 
mythological ideas of death or a hero s selfsacrifice as leading to immo rtality miss millers sacrifice of 
chiwantopel is interprete d as the urging from the unconscious to  renounce her longing for regression to 
the maternal depths more than just a study in i ndividual psychology miss millers problem is seen as 
reflecting that of humanity in general the symbol s employed in her visions are mythological figures 
born to the unconscious it was not the incest taboo th at forced mankind forward but the evolutionary 
instinct from which this and other taboos came indian philosophy as a sort of refined mythology 
dealing with sacrifice is reviewed  with other legendary and mythol ogical sacrifice symbolism and a 
comparison is made of th e differences between mithraic and christian sacrifice based on this 
difference miss millers fantasy wh ich kills both horse and hero is interpreted as the unconscious urge 
to renounce not only the biological drives represented by the horse but her egohood which is 
represented b y the hero the drama enacted throu gh chiwanto pel and the horse will now have to be 
acted out in life by miss mill er herself  references

ed princeton university pr ess   p p   
the conception of the role of psychot herapy in cases such as miss millers is detailed it is felt that at 
the conclusion of miss millers visi ons the threat to her from the uncons cious was apparent but that she 
was unable to deal with it and a ssimilate her hero to her consci ous personality because she had no 
understanding of the meaning of the symbols present in  her fantasies fantasy production is described as 
psychic energy not under conscious control and is seen as a precursor of psychic disturbance the role o f 
the psychotherapist is to help th e patient assimilate part of the unconscious and abolish dissociation by 
integration of unconscious tendencies with the conscious mind miss millers individual case is 
considered an example of the unconscious manifestat ions which precede psychic disorder which led to 
this survey of problems of greater proportions thus fantasies dreams and delusions as an expression of 
the patients psychic situ ation are the material with which a scientist augments human knowledge

the miller fantasies fo rming the foundation material for symbols of transformation  are reproduced 
as written by miss frank miller they include remarks on suggestion two dream poems and the 
hypnagogic vision of the story of ch iwantopel brief background inform ation on what she was doing or 
thinking just before the poems and the story vision oc curred to her is given mi ss miller assumes that all 
persons of a sympathetic nature experience suggesti on or autosuggestion as she does she explains the 
dream poems as combinations of impressions fr om literature plays a nd philosophy the vision of 
chiwantopel experienced in what miss miller de scribes as an anticipator y mood before sleep is 
detailed it includes the appearance of the aztec the horses battle a dream city  a change of scene to a 
wood where chiwantopel defies the threat by an indian arrow his search for a soul mate his despair the 
appearance of a viper and the ensu ing death of his horse and himsel f miss miller calls chiwantopel 
hero of the story her spirit guide and analyz es the vision by finding the everyday sources of its 
contents such as the heros name and the appear ance of the volcano in shakespeare hiawatha other 
literature philosophy and experiences of her own she al so feels that her search for an original idea 
continuing over several days pre ceding the vision may have played  a role in precipitating the 
hypnagogic fantasy she considers her visions generall y in a literary and superficial light without 
questioning whether any deeper psychic forces have contributed to them
