lecture i   
ladies and gentlemen when i was honored with the invitation from clark university to lecture 
before this esteemed assemblage a wish was at the s ame time expressed that i should speak 
about my methods of work and especially about the psychology of childhood i hope to 
accomplish this task in the following manner  
in my first lecture i shall try to present to you the view points of my association methods in my 
second lecture i shall discuss the significance of the familiar constellations while in my third 
lecture i shall enter more fully into the psychology of the child  
i might easily confine myself exclusively to my theoretical views but i be lieve that it will be 
better to illustrate my lectures with as many practical examples as possible we shall therefore 
occupy ourselves first with the method of association a method which has been of valuable 
assistance to me both practically and theoreti cally the association method in vogue in 
psychology as well as its history is of course so familiar to you that there is no need to speak of 
it for practical purposes i make use of the following formulary

this formulary has been constructed after many years of experience the words are chosen and 
partially arranged in such a manner as to strike easily almost all complexes of practical 
occurrence as shown by the above formulary there is a regular mixing of the grammatical 
qualities of the words this too has its definite reas ons  
before the experiment begins the test person receives the following instruction answer as 
quickly as possible the first word that occurs to your mind  this instruction is so simple that it 
can easily be followed by anybody the work itself moreover appears extremely easy so that is 
might be expected that any one could accomplish it with the greatest facility and promptitude 
but contrary to expectati on the behavior is quite different

the illustrations below pp  ff show the course of the reaction time in hysterical 
individuals the light cr osshatched columns denote the locations where the test person was 
unable to react so called failures  
the first thing that strikes us is the fact that many test persons show a marked prolongation of the 
reaction time this would make us think at first of intellectual difficulties  wrongly however 
as we are often dealing with very intelligent persons of fluent speech the explanation lies rather 
in the emotions in order to understand the matter comprehensively we must bear in mind that 
the associati on experiments cannot deal with a separated psychic function for any psychic 
occurrence is never a thing in itself but is always the resultant of the entire psychological past 
the association experiment too is not merely a method for the reproduction of separated word 
couplets but it is a kind of pastime a conversation between experimenter and test person in a 
certain sense it is even still more than that words are really something like condensed actions 
situations and things when i present a wo rd to the test person which denotes an action it is the 
same as if i should present to him the action itself and ask him how do you behave towards it 
what do you think of it what do you do in this situation if i were a magician i should cause 
the si tuation corresponding to the stimulus word to appear in reality and placing the test person 
in its midst i should then study his manner of reaction the result of my stimulus words would 
thus undoubtedly approach infinitely nearer perfection but as we ar e not magicians we must be 
contented with the linguistic substitutes for reality at the same time we p  must not forget 
that the stimulus word will as a rule always conjure up its corresponding situation it all depends 
on how the test person reacts  to this situation the situation bride or bridegroom will not 
the association method  
get any book for free on   wwwabikacom  
evoke a simple reaction in a young lady but the reaction will be deeply influenced by the 
provoked strong feeling tones the more so if the experimenter be a man    
 
it thus happens that the test person is often unable to react p  quickly and smoothly to all 
stimulus words in reality too there are certain stimulus words which  denote actions situations 
or things about which the test person cannot think quickly and surely and this fact is shown in 
the association experiments the example which i have just presented shows an abundance of 
long reaction times and other disturba nces    
the association method

p  in this case the reaction to the stimulus word is in some way impeded that is the 
adaptation to the stimulus word is disturbed  the stimulus words are therefore merely a part of 
reality acting upon us indeed a person who shows such disturbances to the stimulus words is in 
a certain sense really but imperfectly adapted to reality    
 
disease is an imperfect adaptation hence in this case we are dealing with something morbid in 
the psyche  with something which is either temporary or persistently pathological that is we 
the association method  
get any book for free on   wwwabikacom  
are dealing with a psychoneurosis with a functional disturbance of the mind this rule however 
as we shall see later is not without its exceptions  
let us in the first place continue the discussion concerning the prolonged reaction time it often 
happens that the test person actually does not know what to answer to the stimulus p  word 
the test person waives any reaction for the moment he totally fails to obey the original 
instructions and shows himself incapable of adapting himself to the exp erimenter if this 
phenomenon occurs frequently in an experiment it signifies a higher degree of disturbance in 
adjustment i call attention to the fact that it is quite indifferent what reason the test person gives 
for the refusal some find that too many  ideas suddenly occur to them others that not enough 
ideas come to their minds in most cases however the difficulties first perceived are so deterrent 
that they actually give up the whole reaction the following example shows a case of hysteria 
with m any failures of reaction    
 
in example  we find a characteristic phenomenon the test person is not content with the 
requirements of the instruct ion that is she is not satisfied with one word but reacts with many 
words she apparently does more and better than the instruction requires but in so doing she 
does not fulfill the requirements of the instruction thus she reacts  custom  good  barbaric 
foolish  narrow minded  restricted family  big  small  everything possible  
p  these examples show in the first place that many other words connect themselves with 
the reaction word the test person is unable to suppress the ideas which  subsequently occur to 
her in doing this she also pursues a certain tendency which perhaps is more distinctly expressed 
in the following reaction new  old  as an opposite the addition of as an opposite denotes 
that the test person has the desire to add something explanatory or supplementary this tendency 
the association method  
get any book for free on   wwwabikacom  
is also shown in the following reaction finger  not only hand also foot  a limb  member  
extremity  
here we have a whole series of supplements it seems as if the reaction were not sufficient  for 
the test person as if something else must always be added as if what has been already said were 
incorrect or in some way imperfect this feeling we may with janet designate as the  sentiment 
dincompltude  which by no means explains everything i enter somewhat deeper into this 
phenomenon because it is quite frequently encountered in neurotic individuals indeed it is not 
merely a small and unimportant subsidiary manifestation in an insignificant experiment but 
rather an elemental and universal ma nifestation which otherwise plays a rle in the psychic life 
of neurotics  
with his desire to supplement the test person betrays a tendency to give the experimenter more 
than he wants he even exerts the greatest efforts to seek further mental occurrences  in order 
finally to discover something quite satisfactory if we translate this elementary observation into 
the psychology of everyday life it signifies that the test person has a tendency constantly to give 
to others more feeling than is required and ex pected according to freud this is a sign of a 
reinforced object libido that is it is a compensation for an inner unsatisfaction and voidness of 
feeling in this elementary observation we therefore see one of the main qualities of hysterics 
namely the  tendency to allow themselves to be carried away by everything to attach themselves 
enthusiastically to everything and to always promise too much and hence do little patients 
having this symptom in my experience are always hard to deal with at first they are 
enthusiastically enraptured with the physician for a time going so far as to accept everything 
blindly but they soon merge into just as blind a resistance against the physician  thus rendering 
any educative influence absolutely impossible  
we see therefore in this phenomenon the expression of a tendency to give more than the 
instruction demands and expects this tendency betrays itself also in other failures to follow the 
instruction  
to quarrel  angry  different things  i always quarrel at  home  
to marry  how can you marry  reunion  union  
p  plum  to eat  to pluck  what do you mean by it  is it symbolic  
to sin  this idea is quite strange to me i do not recognize it  
these reactions show that the test person gets away altogether from the situation of the 
experiment for the instruction demands that he should answer only the word which next occurs 
to him here we find that the stimulus words apparently act with excessive strength that they are 
taken as if they were dire ct personal questions the test person entirely forgets that we deal with 
mere words which stand in print before us and seeks in them a personal meaning he tries to 
divine them and defend himself against them thus altogether forgetting the instructions   
this elementary observation depicts another common peculiarity of hysterics namely that of 
taking everything personally of never being able to remain objective and of allowing 
themselves to be carried away by momentary impressions this again shows t he characteristics of 
the enhanced object libido  
the association method

another sign of impeded adaptation is the often occurring repetitions of the stimulus words  the 
test persons repeat the stimulus word as if they had not heard or understood it distinctly they 
repeat it j ust as we repeat a difficult question in order better to grasp it before answering this 
same tendency is shown in the experiment the questions are repeated because the stimulus 
words act on hysterical individuals almost like difficult and personal questi ons in principle it is 
the same phenomenon as the subsequent completion of the reaction  
in many experiments we observe that the same reaction constantly reappears to the most varied 
stimulus words these words seem to possess a special reproduction tend ency and it is very 
interesting to examine their relationship to the test person for example i have observed a case 
in which the patient repeated the word short a great many times and often in places where it 
had no meaning the test person could not directly state the reason for the repetition of the word 
short from experience i knew that such predicates always relate either to the test person 
himself or to the person nearest to him i assumed that in this word short he designated 
himself and th at in this way he helped to express something very painful to him the test person 
is of very small stature he is the youngest of four brothers who in contrast to him are all tall he 
was always the  child  in the family he was nicknamed short and was  treated by all as the 
little one this resulted in a total loss of self confidence although he was intelligent and 
despite long p  study he could not decide to present himself for examination he finally 
became impotent and merged into a psych osis in which whenever he was alone he took delight 
in walking about in his room on his toes in order to appear taller the word short therefore 
signified to him a great many painful experiences this is usually the case with the repeated 
words they  always contain something very important for the individual psychology of the test 
person  
the signs thus far depicted are not found arbitrarily spread throughout the whole experiment but 
only in very definite locations namely in those stimulus words w hich strike against special 
emotionally accentuated complexes this fact is the foundation of the so called diagnosis of 
facts  tatbestandsdiagnostik  that is of the method employed to discover by means of an 
association experiment the culprit among a  number of persons suspected of a crime that this is 
possible i should like to demonstrate briefly in a concrete case  
on the th of february  our supervisor reported to me that a nurse complained to her of 
having been robbed during the forenoon of  the previous day the facts were as follows the 
nurse kept her money amounting to  francs in a pocketbook which she had placed in her 
cupboard where she also kept her clothes the cupboard contained two compartments of which 
one belonged to the nurs e who was robbed and the other to the head nurse these two nurses and 
a third one who was an intimate friend of the head nurse slept in the same room where the 
cupboard was the room was in a section which was regularly occupied in common by six 
nurses  who had free access to this room given such a state of affairs it is not to be wondered 
that the supervisor shrugged her shoulders when i asked her whom she most suspected  
further investigation showed that on the morning of the theft the above mentione d friend of the 
head nurse was slightly indisposed and remained in bed in the room the whole morning hence 
following the indications of the plaintiff the theft could have taken place only in the afternoon 
of the other four nurses upon whom suspicion co uld fall there was only one who regularly 
the association method

attended to the cleaning of the room in question while the remaining three had nothing to do in 
this room nor was it shown that any of them had spent any time there on the previous day  
it was therefore natural  that these last three nurses should be regarded for the time being as less 
implicated and i therefore began by subjecting the first three to the experiment  
from the particulars of the case i also knew that the cupboard was locked but that the key was 
kept not far away in a  
p  very conspicuous place that on opening the cupboard the first thing to be seen was a fur 
ornament boa and moreover that the pocketbook was between the linen in an inconspicuous 
place the pocketbook was of dark reddis h leather and contained the following objects one  
franc banknote one  franc piece some centimes one small silver watch chain one stencil 
used in the insane asylum to mark the kitchen utensils and one small receipt from dosenbachs 
shoeshop in z rich  
besides the plaintiff and the guilty one only the head nurse knew the exact particulars of the 
deed for as soon as the former missed her money she immediately asked the head nurse to help 
her find it thus the head nurse had been able to learn th e smallest details which naturally 
rendered the experiment still more difficult for she was precisely the one most suspected the 
conditions for the experiment were better for the others since they knew nothing concerning the 
particulars of the deed an d some not even that a crime had been committed as critical stimulus 
words i selected the name of the robbed nurse plus the following words cupboard door open 
key yesterday banknote gold    money watch pocketbook chain silver to hid e fur 
dark reddish leather centimes stencil receipt dosenbach besides these words which referred 
directly to the deed i took also the following which had a special affective value theft to take 
to steal suspicion blame court police to lie  to fear to discover to arrest innocent  
the objection is often made to the last species of words that they may produce a strong affective 
resentment even in innocent persons and for that reason one cannot attribute to them any 
comparative value nev ertheless it may always be questioned whether the affective resentment 
of an innocent person will have the same effect on the association as that of a guilty one and that 
question can only be authoritatively answered by experience until the contrary sha ll be 
demonstrated i maintain that even words of the above mentioned type may profitably be used  
i then distributed these critical words among twice as many indifferent stimulus words in such a 
manner that each critical word was followed by two indiffer ent ones as a rule it is well to 
follow up the critical words by indifferent words in order that the action of the first may be 
clearly distinguished but one may also follow up one critical word by another especially if one 
wishes to bring into relief t he action of the second thus i placed together darkish red and 
leather and chain and silver  
after this preparatory work i undertook the experiment p  with the three above mentioned 
nurses as examinations of this kind can be rendered into  a foreign tongue only with the greatest 
difficulty i will content myself with presenting the general results and with giving some 
examples i first undertook the experiment with the friend of the head nurse and judging by the 
circumstances she appeared  only slightly moved the head nurse was next examined she 
the association method  
get any book for free on   wwwabikacom  
showed marked excitement her pulse being  per minute immediately after the experiment 
the last to be examined was the nurse who attended to the cleaning of the room in which the 
theft occurre d she was the most tranquil of the three she displayed but little embarrassment 
and only in the course of the experiment did it occur to her that she was suspected of stealing a 
fact which manifestly disturbed her towards the end of the experiment  
the general impression from the examination spoke strongly against the head nurse it seemed to 
me that she evinced a very suspicious or i might almost say impudent countenance with 
the definite idea of finding in her the guilty one i set about adding  up the results  
one can make use of many special methods of computing but they are not all equally good and 
equally exact one must always resort to calculation as appearances are enormously deceptive 
the method which is most to be recommended is th at of the probable average of the reaction 
time it shows at a glance the difficulties which the person in the experiment had to overcome in 
the reaction  
the technique of this calculation is very simple the probable average is the middle number of 
the various reaction times arranged in a series the reaction times are for example  placed in 
the following manner               th e number found in the middle 
 is the probable average of this series following the order of the experiment i shall denote 
the friend of the head nurse by the letter a the head nurse by b and the third nurse by c  
the probable averages of the reacti on are  
a               b               c 
                         
no conclusions can be drawn from this result but the average reaction times calculated 
separately for the indifferent reactions for the critical and for those immediately fol lowing the 
critical post critical are more interesting    
 
from this example we see that whereas a has the shortest reaction time for the indiff erent 
reactions she shows in com   
p  parison to the other two persons of the experiment the longest time for the critical 
reactions  
the difference between the reaction times let us say between the indifferent and the critical is  
for a  for  b and  for c that is it is more than double for a when compared with the other 
two persons  
the association method

in the same way we can calculate how many complex indicators there are on an average for the 
indifferent critical etc reactions  
 
the difference between the indifferent and critical reactions for a   for b   for c   a 
is again the highest  
another question to consider is in what speci al way do the imperfect reactions behave  
the result for a   for b   and for c    
here too a reaches the highest value and in this i believe we see the characteristic moment of 
the guilt complex in a i am however unable to explain h ere circumstantially the reasons why i 
maintain that memory errors are related to an emotional complex as this would lead me beyond 
the limits of the present work i therefore refer the reader to my work  ueber die 
reproductionsstrrungen im associationse xperiment  ix beitrag der diegnost associat 
studien  
as it often happens that an association of strong feeling tone produces in the experiment a 
perseveration with the result that not only the critical association but also two or three 
successive p   associations are imperfectly reproduced it will be very interesting for our 
cases to see how many imperfect reproductions are so arranged in the series the result of 
computation shows that the imperfect reproductions thus arranged in series are fo r a  for 
b  and for c   
again we find that a has the greatest percentage to be sure this may partially depend on the 
fact that a also possesses the greatest number of imperfect reproductions given a small quantity 
of reactions it is usu al that the greater the total number of the same the more imperfect reactions 
will occur in groups but in order that this should be probable it could not occur in so great a 
measure as in our case where on the other hand b and c have not a much smaller n umber of 
imperfect reactions when compared to a it is significant that c with her slight emotions during 
the experiment shows the minimum of imperfect reproductions arranged in series  
as imperfect reproductions are also complex indicators it is necessa ry to see how they distribute 
themselves in respect to the indifferent critical etc reactions    
the association method

it is hardly necessary to bring into prominen ce the differences between the indifferent and the 
critical reactions of the various subjects as shown by the resulting numbers of the table in this 
respect too a occupies first place  
naturally here too there is a probability that the greater the q uantity of the imperfect 
reproductions the greater is their number in the critical reactions if we suppose that the 
imperfect reproductions are distributed regularly and without choice among all the reactions 
there will be a greater number of them for a  in comparison to b and c even as reactions to 
critical words since a has the greater number of imperfect reproductions admitting such a 
uniform distribution of the imperfect reproductions it is easy to calculate how many we ought to 
expect to belong to  each individual kind of reaction  
from this calculation it appears that the disturbances of reproductions which concern the critical 
reactions for a surpass by far the expected for c they are  higher than the ex p  pected 
while for b the real number is less than the one expected    
 
all this points to the fact than in the subject a the critical stimulus words acted with the greatest 
intensity and hence the greatest suspicion falls on a practically one may venture to designate 
such a subject as probably guilty the same evening a made a complete confession of the theft 
and thus the success of the experiment was confirmed  
i maintain th at such a result should be of scientific interest and worthy of consideration there is 
much in experimental psychology which is less useful than the material treated in this work 
putting aside altogether the theoretical interest we have in this case som ething that is not to be 
despised from a practical point of view to wit we have brought to light the culpable affair in a 
much easier and shorter way than is customary what has been possible once or twice ought to 
be possible again in other cases and i t is well worth while to investigate the means of rendering 
the method increasingly capable of rapid and sure results

this applicability of the experiment shows it possible to strike a concealed indeed and 
unconscious complex by means of a stimulus wor d and conversely we may assume with great 
certainty that behind a reaction which shows a complex indicator there is a hidden complex even 
though the test person strongly denies it one must get rid of the idea that educated and 
intelligent test persons a re able to see and admit their own complexes every human mind 
contains much that is unacknowledged and hence unconscious as such and no one can boast that 
he stands completely above his complexes those who persist in maintaining it do not see the 
specta cles which they wear on their noses  
it has long been thought that the association experiment p  enables one to distinguish 
certain intellectual types that is not the case the experiment does not give us any particular 
insight into the purely inte llectual but rather only into the emotional processes to be sure we 
can erect certain types of reaction they are not however based on intellectual peculiarities but 
depend entirely on the proportionate emotional state  educated test persons usually s how 
superficial and linguistically deep rooted associations whereas the uneducated form more 
valuable associations and often of ingenious significance this behavior would be paradoxical 
from an intellectual viewpoint the meaningful associations of the u neducated are not really the 
product of intellectual thinking but are simply the results of a special emotional state the whole 
thing is more important to the uneducated his emotion is greater and for that reason he pays 
more attention to the experiment  than the educated person and that is why his associations are 
more significant aside from the types determined by education we have to consider three 
principal individual types  
 an objective type with undisturbed reactions  
 a so called complex t ype with many disturbances in the experiment occasioned by the 
constellation of a complex  
 a so called definition type this type consists in the fact that the reaction always gives an 
explanation or a definition of the content of the stimulus word e g  
                                                                            apple  a tree fruit  
                 table  a piece of household furniture  
   to promenade  an activity  
  father  chief of the family  
this type is chiefly found in stupid persons and it is therefore quite usual in imbecility but it 
can also be found in persons who are not really stupid but who do not wish to be taken as stupid  
thus a young student from whom associations were taken by an older intelligent woman  student 
reacted altogether with definitions the test person was of the opinion that it was an examination 
in intelligence and therefore directed most of his attention to the significance of the stimulus 
words his associations therefore looked like th ose of an idiot not all idiots however react 
with definitions probably only those so react who would like to appear smarter than they are 
that is those whom their stupidity is painful i designate this widespread complex as 
intelligence complex a normal test person reacts in a most overdrawn manner as follows  
                                                                              anxiety  heart anguish  
  to kiss  loves unfolding  
the association method  
get any book for free on   wwwabikacom  
               to kiss  perception of friendship  
this type gives a constrained and unnatural impression the test persons wish to be more than 
they are they wish to  
p  exert more influence than they really have hence we see that persons with an 
intelligence complex are usually not natural and uncons trained that they are always somewhat 
unnatural and flowery they show a predilection for complicated foreign words high sounding 
quotations and other intellectual ornaments in this way they wish to influence their fellow 
beings they wish to impress o thers with their apparent education and intelligence and thus to 
compensate for the painful feeling of stupidity the definition type is closely related to the 
predicate type or to express it more precisely to the predicate type expressing personal 
judgment  wertprdikattypus  for example  
                                                                                flower  pretty  
                                                                                money  convenient  
                                                                                animal  ugly  
                                                                                knife  dangerous  
                                                                                death  ghastly  
in the definition type the intellectual significance of the stimulus word is rendered prominent 
while in the predicate type it is its emotional significance  there are predicate types which are 
altogether overdrawn where there appear reactions like the following  
                                                                                piano  horrible  
                                                                                to sing  heavenly  
     mother  ardently lo ved 
                      father  something good nice holy  
in the definition type an absolute intellectual make up is manifested or rather simulated but here 
there is a very emotional one yet just as the definition type really conceals a lack of i ntelligence 
so the excessive emotional  expression conceals or overcompensates an emotional deficiency 
this conclusion is very interestingly illustrated by the following discovery  
 on investigating the influence of the familiar milieus on the associatio n type it was found that 
young individuals seldom possess a predicate type but that on the other hand the predicate type 
increases in frequency with the advancing age in women the increase of the predicate type 
begins a little after the th year and i n men after the th that is the precise time when owing 
to the deficiency of sexuality there actually occurs considerable emotional loss if a test person 
evinces a distinct predicate type it may always be inferred that a marked internal emotional 
deficiency is thereby compensated still one cannot reason conversely namely that an inner 
emotional deficiency must produce a predicate type no more than that idiocy directly produces a 
definition type a predicate type can also betray itself through the ex ternal behavior as for 
example through a particular affectation enthusiastic exclamations an embellished behavior 
and the constrained sounding language so often observed in society  
p  the complex type shows no particular tendency except the concealment  of a complex 
whereas the definition and predicate types betray a positive tendency to exert in some way a 
definite influence on the experimenter but whereas the definition type tends to bring to light its

intelligence the predicate type displ ays its emotion i need hardly add of what importance such 
determinations are for the diagnosis of character  
after finishing an association experiment i usually add another experiment of a different kind 
the so called reproduction  i repeat the same sti mulus words and ask the test persons whether 
they still remember their former reactions in many instances the memory fails and as 
experience shows these locations are stimulus words which touched an emotionally accentuated 
complex or stimulus words imm ediately following such critical words  
this phenomenon has been designated as paradoxical and contrary to all experience for it is 
known that emotionally accentuated things are better retained in memory than indifferent things 
this is quite true but i t does not hold for the linguistic  expression of an emotionally accentuated 
content on the contrary one very easily forgets what he has said under emotion one is even apt 
to contradict himself about it indeed the efficacy of cross examinations in court depends on this 
fact the reproduction method therefore serves to render still more prominent the complex 
stimulus in normal persons we usually find a limited number of false reproductions seldom 
more than   while in abnormal persons especially in  hysterics we often find from  
 of false reproductions the reproduction certainty is therefore in certain cases a measure for 
the emotivity of the test person  
by far the larger number of neurotics show a pronounced tendency to cover up their intim ate 
affairs in impenetrable darkness even from the doctor so that the doctor finds it very difficult to 
form a proper picture of the patients psychology in such cases i am greatly assisted by the 
association experiment when the experiment is finished i first look over the general course of 
the reaction times i see a great many very prolonged times which in itself means that the patient 
can only adjust himself with difficulty that his psychological functions proceed with marked 
internal frictions wit h resistances  by far the greater number of neurotics react only under great 
and hence very distinct resistances there are however cases in which the average reaction times 
are as short as in the normal and in whom the other complex indicators are lacki ng but who 
despite that fact undoubtedly present neurotic symptoms these rare cases are especially found 
among very intelligent p  and educated chronic patients who after many years of practice 
have learned to control their outward behavior and t herefore outwardly display very little if 
anything of their neuroses on superficial observation they can be taken as normal yet in some 
places they show disturbances which betray the repressed complex

after examining the reaction times i turn my attention to the type of the association to ascertain 
with what type i am dealing if it is a predicate type i draw the conclusions which i have detail ed 
above if it is a complex type i try to ascertain the nature of the complex with the necessary 
experience one can readily emancipate himself from the test persons statements and almost 
without any previous knowledge of the test persons it is possible under certain circumstances to 
read the most intimate complexes from the results of the experiment i at first look for the 
reproduction words and put them together and i then look for the stimulus words which show 
the greatest disturbances in many cases  a mere assortment of these words suffices to show the 
complex in some cases it is necessary to put a question here and there it will be best to illustrate 
this with a concrete example  
it concerns an educated woman of  years who has been married for three years after her 
marriage she suffers from episodic excitements in which she is violently jealous of her husband 
the marriage is a happy one in every other respect and it should be noted that the husband gives 
no cause for the jealousy the patient is sure that she loves him and that her excited states are 
groundless she cannot imagine whence these excited states originate and feels quite perplexed 
over them it is to be noted that the patient is a catholic and has been brought up religiously 
while her husband is a protestant this difference of religion did not admittedly play any part a 
more thorough anamnesis showed the existence of an extreme prudishness thus for example 
no one was allowed to talk in the patients presence about her sister s childbirth because the 
sexual moment suggested therein caused her the greatest excitement she always undressed in 
the adjoining room and never in her husbands presence etc at the age of  she was supposed 
to have had no idea how children were born  the associations gave the results shown in the 
accompanying chart  
the blue columns represent failures of reproductions the green ones represent repetitions of 
stimulus words and the yellow columns show those associations in which the patient either 
laughed or made mistakes using many instead of one word the height of the columns represent 
the length of the reaction time  
p  the stimulus words characterized by marked disturbances are the following yellow to 
pray to separate to marry to qua rrel old family happiness false fear to kiss bride to choose 
contented the strongest disturbances are found in the following stimulus words to pray to 
marry happiness false fear and contented  these words therefore seemingly strike the 
complex above all the conclusion that can be drawn from this is that she is not indifferent to the 
fact that her husband is a protestant for she again thinks of praying that there is something 
wrong with marriage that she is false that is she entertain s fancies of faithlessness she is afraid 
of the husband of the future she is not contented with her choice to choose and she thinks 
of separation the patient therefore has a separation complex for she is very discontented with 
her married life wh en i told her this result she was affected and at first attempted to deny it 
then to mince over it but finally she admitted everything i said and added still more she 
reproduced a large number of fancies of faithlessness reproaches against her husband  etc her 
prudishness and jealousy were merely a projection of her own sexual wishes on her husband  
because she was faithless in her fancies and did not admit it to herself she was jealous of her 
husband

ladies and gentlemen as you have seen there are manifold ways in w hich the association 
experiment may be employed in practical psychology i should like to speak to you to day about 
another utilization of this experiment which is primarily of only theoretical significance my 
pupil miss frst md has made the followi ng research she has applied the association 
experiment to  families consisting altogether of  test persons the resulting material 
amounted to  associations this material was elaborated in the following manner fifteen 
separate groups were for med according to logical linguistic standards and the associations were 
arranged as follows

order to find a base for the total resemblance i have calculated the differences among all of miss

the other unrelated females the same has been done for the male test persons  
the most marked difference is found in those cases where the two test persons compared have no 
associative quality in common all the groups are calculated in p ercentages the greatest 
difference possible being       
i the average difference of male unrelated test persons is  and that of females of the same 
group is

great diversity and lawlessness of associations b ut as we see the opposite is the case thus the 
daughter lives contently in the same circle of ideas as her mother not only in her thought but in 
her form of expression indeed she even uses the same words what seems more flighty more 
inconstant and m ore lawless than a fancy a rapidly passing thought it is not however lawless 
and not free but closely determined within the limits of the milieu if therefore even the 
superficial and manifestly most flighty formations of the intellect are altogeth er subject to the 
milieu constellation what should we expect for the more important conditions of the mind for 
the emotions wishes hopes and intentions let us consider a concrete example  the curve a 
see above  
the mother is  years old and th e daughter  years both have a very distinct predicate type 
expressing personal judgment and differ from the father in the most striking manner the father 
is a drunkard and a demoralized creature we can thus readily understand that his wife perceives 
an emotional voidness which she naturally betrays by her enhanced predicate type the same 
causes cannot however operate in the daughter for in the first place she is not married to a 
drunkard and secondly life with all its hopes still lies before her  it is distinctly unnatural for the 
daughter to show an extreme predicate type expressing personal judgment she responds to the 
stimuli of the environment just like her mother but whereas in the mother the formation is in a 
way a natural consequence of h er unhappy condition of life this condition is entirely lacking in 
the daughter the daughter simply imitates the mother she merely appears like the mother let 
us consider what this can signify for a young girl if a young girl reacts to the world like an old 
woman disappointed in life this at once shows unnaturalness and constraint but more serious 
consequences are possible as you know the predicate type is a manifestation of intensive 
emotions emotions are always involved thus we cannot prevent our selves from answering at 
least inwardly to the feelings and passions of our p  nearest environment we allow 
ourselves to be infected and carried away by it originally the affects and their physical 
manifestations had a biological significance ie they were a protective mechanism for the 
individual and the whole herd if we manifest emotions we can with certainty expect to receive 
emotions in return that is the sense of the predicate type what the  yearold woman lacks in 
emotions ie in lo ve in her marriage relations she seeks to obtain from the outside and it is for 
that reason that she is an ardent participant in the christian science meetings if the daughter 
imitates this situation she does the same thing as her mother she seeks to ob tain emotions from 
the outside but for a girl of  such an emotional state is to say the least quite dangerous like 
her mother she reacts to her environment as a sufferer soliciting sympathy such an emotional 
state is no longer dangerous in the mother  but for obvious reasons it is quite dangerous in the 
daughter once freed from her father and mother she will be like her mother ie she will be a 
suffering woman craving for inner gratification she will thus be exposed to the greatest danger 
of falli ng a victim to brutality and of marrying a brute and inebriate like her father  
this consideration seems to me to be of importance for the conception of the influence of 
environment and education the example shows what passes over from the mother to the child it 
is not the good and pious precepts nor is it any other inculcation of pedagogic truths that have a 
moulding influence upon the character of the developing child but what most influences him is 
the peculiarly affective state which is totally unk nown to his parents and educators the 
concealed discord between the parents the secret worry the repressed hidden wishes all these 
produce in the individual a certain affective state with its objective signs which slowly but 
the association method

surely though unconsciousl y works its way into the childs mind producing therein the same 
conditions and hence the same reactions to external stimuli we know that association with 
mournful and melancholic persons will depress us too a restless and nervous individual infects 
his surroundings with unrest and dissatisfaction a grumbler with his discontent etc if grown up 
persons are so sensitive to such surrounding influences we certainly ought to expect more of this 
in the child whose mind is as soft and plastic as wax the father and mother impress deeply into 
the childs mind the seal of their personality the more sensitive and mouldable the child the 
deeper is the impression thus even things that are never spoken about are reflected in the child 
the child imitates the g esture and just as the gesture of the parent is the expression of an 
emotional state so in turn the gesture gradually produces in the child a p  similar feeling 
as it feels itself so to speak into the gesture just as the parents adapt themselve s to the world so 
does the child at the age of puberty when it begins to free itself from the spell of the family it 
enters into life with so to say a surface of fracture entirely in keeping with that of the father and 
mother the frequent and often very  deep depressions of puberty  emanate from this they are 
symptoms which are rooted in the difficulty of new adjustment the youthful person at first tries 
to separate himself as much as possible from his family he may even estrange himself from it 
but in wardly this only ties him the more firmly to the parental image i recall the case of a young 
neurotic who ran away from his parents he was strange and almost hostile to them but he 
admitted to me that he possessed a special sanctum it was a strong box containing his old 
childhood books old dried flowers stones and even small bottles of water from the well at his 
home and from a river along which he walked with his parents etc  
the first attempts to assume friendship and love are constellated in the  strongest manner possible 
by the relation to parents and here one can usually observe how powerful are the influences of 
the familiar constellations it is not rare eg for a healthy man whose mother was hysterical to 
marry a hysterical or for the da ughter of an alcoholic to choose an alcoholic for her husband i 
was once consulted by an intelligent and educated young woman of  who suffered from a 
peculiar symptom she thought that her eyes now and then took on a strange expression which 
exerted a d isagreeable influence on men if she then looked at a gentleman he became 
embarrassed turned away and said something rapidly to his neighbor at which both were 
embarrassed or inclined to laugh the patient was convinced that her look excited indecent 
thoughts in the men it was impossible to convince her of the falsity of her conviction this 
symptom immediately aroused in me the suspicion that i dealt with a case of paranoia rather than 
with a neurosis but as was shown only three days later by the furth er course of the treatment i 
was mistaken for the symptom promptly disappeared after it had been explained by analysis it 
originated in the following manner the lady had a lover who deserted her in a very striking 
manner she felt utterly forsaken she  withdrew from all society and pleasure and entertained 
suicidal ideas in her seclusion there accumulated unadmitted and repressed erotic wishes which 
she unconsciously projected on men whenever she was in their company this gave rise to her 
conviction that her look excited erotic wishes in men further investigation showed that her 
deserting lover was alunatic sic which she did not apparently observe i expressed my surprise 
at her unsuitable choice and added p  that she must have had a certain  predilection for 
loving mentally abnormal persons this she denied stating that she had once before been 
engaged to be married to a normal man he too deserted her and on further investigation it was 
found that he too had been in an insane asylum sh ortly before  another lunatic this seemed to 
me to confirm with sufficient certainty my belief that she had an unconscious tendency to choose 
the association method

insane persons whence originated this strange taste her father was an eccentric character and 
in later years  entirely estranged from his family her whole love had therefore been turned away 
from her father to a brother  years her senior him she loved and honored as a father and this 
brother became hopelessly insane at the age of  that was apparently the m odel from which 
the patient could never free herself after which she chose her lovers and through which she had 
to become unhappy her neurosis which gave the impression of insanity probably originated 
from this infantile model we must take into conside ration that we are dealing in this case with a 
highly educated and intelligent lady who did not pass carelessly over her mental experiences 
who indeed reflected much over her unhappiness without however having any idea whence her 
misfortune originated  
these are things which inwardly appeal to us as matter of course and it is for this reason that we 
do not see them but attribute everything to the so called congenital character i could cite any 
number of examples of this kind every patient furnishes c ontributions to this subject of the 
determination of destiny through the influence of the familiar milieus in every neurotic we see 
how the constellation of the infantile milieu influences not only the character of the neurosis but 
also lifes destiny in  its very details numberless unhappy choices of profession and matrimonial 
failures can be traced to this constellation there are however cases where the profession has 
been happily chosen where the husband or wife leaves nothing to be desired and wh ere still the 
person does not feel well but works and lives under constant difficulties such cases often appear 
in the guise of chronic neurasthenia here the difficulty is due to the fact that the mind is 
unconsciously split into two parts of divergent t endencies which are impeding each other one 
part lives with the husband or with the profession while the other lives unconsciously in the past 
with the father or mother i have treated a lady who after suffering many years from a severe 
neurosis merged  into a dementia praecox the neurotic affection began with her marriage this 
ladys husband was kind educated well to do and in every respect suitable for her his character 
showed nothing that would in any way in  p  terfere with a happy marria ge despite that 
the marriage was an unhappy one merely because the wife was neurotic and therefore prevented 
all congenial companionship  
the important heuristic axiom of every psychanalysis reads as follows if a neurosis springs up 
in a person this neu rosis ontains sic the counter argument against the relationship of the 
patient to the personality with which he is most intimately connected  if the husband has a 
neurosis the neurosis thus loudly proclaims that he has intensive resistances and contrary 
tendencies against his wife and if the wife has a neurosis the wife has a tendency which diverges 
from her husband if the person is unmarried the neurosis is then directed against the lover or the 
sweetheart or against the parents every neurotic natural ly strives against this relentless 
formulation of the content of his neurosis and he often refuses to recognize it at any cost but 
still it is always justified to be sure the conflict is not on the surface but must generally be 
revealed through a painst aking psychanalysis  
the history of our patient reads as follows  
the father had a powerful personality she was his favorite daughter and entertained for him a 
boundless veneration at the age of  she for the first time fell in love with a young man at 
that time she had twice the same dream the impression of which never left her in all her later 
the association method  
get any book for free on   wwwabikacom  
years she even imputed to it a mystic significance and often recalled it with religious dread in 
the dream she saw a tall masculine figure with a very bea utiful white beard at this sight she was 
permeated with a feeling of awe and delight as if she experienced the presence of god himself 
this dream made the deepest impression on her and she was constrained to think of it again and 
again the love affair of that period proved to be one of little warmth and was soon given up 
later the patient married her present husband though she loved her husband she was led 
continually to compare him with her deceased father this comparison always proved unfavorable 
to her husband whatever the husband said intended or did was subjected to this standard and 
always with the same result my father would have done all this better and differently our 
patients life with her husband was not happy she could neither re spect nor love him sufficiently 
she was inwardly dissatisfied and unsatiated she gradually evinced a fervent piety and at the 
same time there appeared a violent hysterical affection she began by going into raptures now 
over this and now over that clerg yman she was looking everywhere for a spiritual friend and 
estranged herself more and more from her husband the mental trouble made itself manifest after 
about a decade in her diseased state she refused to have p  anything to do with her 
husband and child she imagined herself pregnant by another man in brief the resistances 
against her husband which hitherto had been laboriously repressed came out quite openly and 
among other things manifested themselves in insults of the gravest kind directed  against her 
husband  
in this case we see how a neurosis appeared as it were at the moment of marriage ie this 
neurosis expresses the counter argument against the husband  what is the counter argument 
the counter argument is the father of the patien t for she verified daily her belief that her 
husband was not equal to her father when the patient first fell in love there also appeared a 
symptom in the form of a very impressive visionary dream she saw the man with the very 
beautiful white beard who was this man on directing her attention to the beautiful white beard 
she immediately recognized the phantom it was of course her father thus every time the patient 
merged into a love affair the picture of the father inopportunely appeared and prevented her from 
adjusting herself psychologically to her husband  
i purposely chose this case as an illustration because it is simple obvious and quite typical of 
many marriages which are crippled through the neurosis of the wife the unhappiness always 
lies in a too firm attachment to the parents the offspring remains in the infantile relations we 
can find here one of the most important tasks of pedagogy namely the solution of the problem 
how to free the growing individual from his unconscious attachments to the influences of the 
infantile milieu in such a manner that he may retain whatever there is in it that is suitable and 
reject whatever is unsuitable to solve this difficult question on the part of the child seems to me 
impossible at present we know as yet too little about the childs emotional processes the first 
and only real contribution to the literature on this subject has in fact appeared during the present 
year it is the analysis of a five yearold boy published by freud  
the difficulties on  the part of the child are very great they should not however be so great on 
the part of the parents in many ways the parents could manage more carefully and more 
indulgently the love of children the sins committed against favorite children by the und ue love 
of the parents could perhaps be avoided through a wider knowledge of the childs mind for 
many reasons i find it impossible to tell you anything of general validity concerning the bringing

up of children as it is affected by this problem we are a s yet very far from general   prescriptions 
and rules are still in the realm of casuistry unfortunately our knowledge of the finer p  
mental processes in the child is so meagre that we are after all not in any position to say where 
the greater troub le lies whether in the parents in the child or in the conception of the milieu 
only psychanalyses of the kind that professor freud has published in our jahrbuch   will 
help us out of this difficulty such comprehensive and profound observations sh ould act as a 
strong inducement to all teachers to occupy themselves with freuds psychology this 
psychology offers more for practical pedagogy than the physiological psychology of the present  
 
 
lecture iii  
experiences concerning the psychic life of the  child   
ladies and gentlemen in the last lecture we have seen how important for later life are the 
emotional processes of childhood in to days lecture i should like to give you some insight into 
the psychic life of the child through the analysis of a  yearold girl it is much to be regretted 
that there are doubtless few among you who have had opportunity to read the analysis of little 
john  kleiner hans  which has been published by freud during the current year  i should 
properly begin by giving you the content of that analysis so that you might be in a position to 
compare for yourselves the results of freud with those obtained by me and to observe the 
marked even  astonishing similarity between the unconscious creations of the two children 
without a knowledge of the fundamental analysis of freud much in the report of the following 
case will appear to you strange incomprehensible and perhaps unacceptable i beg  you 
however to defer final judgment and to enter upon the consideration of these new subjects with a 
kindly disposition for such pioneer work in virgin soil requires not only the greatest patience on 
the part of the investigator but also the unprejudi ced attention of his audience because the 
freudian investigations apparently involve an indelicate discussion of the most intimate secrets 
of sexuality many people have had a feeling of repulsion and have therefore rejected everything 
as a matter of cours e without any real proof this unfortunately has almost always been the fate 
of freuds doctrines until now one must not come to the consideration of these matters with the 
firm conviction that they do not exist else it may easily come to pass that for  the prejudiced they 
really do not exist one should perhaps for the moment assume the authors point of view and 
investigate these phenomena under his guidance in this way only can p  the correctness or 
incorrectness of our observations be affirmed  we may err as all human beings err but the 
continual holding up to us of our mistakes  perhaps they are worse than mistakes  does not 
help us to see things more distinctly we should prefer to see wherein  we err that should be 
shown to us in our o wn sphere of experience thus far however no one has succeeded in 
meeting us on our own ground and in giving us a different conception of the things which we 
ourselves see we must still complain that our critics are persisting in complete ignorance and  
without the slightest notion about the matters in question the only reason for this is that our 
critics have never taken the trouble to become thoroughly acquainted with our method had they 
done this they would have understood us

the little girl to wh ose sagacity and intellectual vivacity   we are indebted for the following 
observations is a healthy lively child of emotional temperament she has never been seriously 
ill and never even in the realm of the nervous system had there been observed any sy mptoms 
prior to this investigation in the report which will now follow we shall have to waive a 
connected description for it is made up of anecdotes which treat of one out of a whole cycle of 
similar experiences and which cannot therefore be arranged scientifically and systematically 
but must rather be described somewhat in the form of a story this manner of description we 
cannot as yet dispense with in our analytic psychology for we are still far from being able in all 
cases to separate with unerri ng certainty the curious from the typical  
when the little daughter whom we will call anna was about  years old she once had the 
following conversation with her grandmother  
anna grandma why have you such withered eyes  
grandma because i am ol d  
a but you will become young again  
g no do you know i shall become older and older and then i shall die  
a well and then  
g then i shall become an angel  
a and then will you again become a little child  
the child found here a w elcome opportunity for the provisional solution of a problem for some 
time before she had been in the habit of asking her mother whether she would ever have a living 
doll a little child a little brother this naturally included the question as to the or igin of children 
as such questions appeared only spontaneously and indirectly the parents attached no 
significance to them but received p  them as lightly and in appearance as facetiously as the 
child seemed to ask them thus she once received fro m her father the amusing information that 
children are brought by the stork anna had already heard somewhere a more serious version 
namely that children are little angels living in heaven and are brought from heaven by the stork 
this theory seems to ha ve become the starting point for the investigating activity of the little one 
from the conversation with the grandmother it could be seen that this theory was capable of wide 
application namely it not only solved in a comforting manner the painful idea of parting and 
dying but at the same time it solved satisfactorily the riddle of the origin of children such 
solutions which kill at least two birds with one stone were formerly tenaciously adhered to in 
science and even in the child they cannot be made  retrograde without some shock  
just as was the birth of a little sister the turning point in the history of little john so it was in 
this case the birth of a brother which happened when anna had reached the age of  years the 
pregnancy of the mother  apparently remained unnoticed ie  the child never expressed herself 
on this subject on the evening before the childbirth when the labor pains began to manifest 
themselves in the mother the child was in her fathers room he took her on his knee and said 
tell me what would you say if you should get a little brother to night i would kill it was 
the prompt answer the expression to kill looks very serious but in reality it is quite harmless 
for to kill and to die in child language signif y only to remove either in the active or in the 
passive sense as has already been pointed out a number of times by freud to kill as used by 
the child is a harmless word especially so when we know that the child uses the word kill

quite promiscuously  for all possible kinds of destruction removal demolition etc it is 
nevertheless worth while to note this tendency see the analysis of kleiner hans  p   
the childbirth occurred early in the morning in the presence of a physician and a midwife when 
all remnants of the birth including some blood traces were cleaned up the father entered the 
room where the little one slept she awoke as he entered he imparted to her the news of the 
advent of a little brother which she took with surprise and st rained facial expression the father 
took her in his arms and carried her into the confinement chamber she first threw a rapid glance 
at her somewhat pale mother and then displayed something like a mixture of despair and 
suspicion as if thinking now wha t else is going to happen fathers impression she displayed 
hardly any pleasure at the sight of the new arrival so that the cool reception she gave it caused 
general disappointment  
p  during the forenoon she kept very noticeably away from her mother this was the more 
striking as she was usually much attached to her mother but once when her mother was alone 
she ran into the room embraced her and said well arent you going to die now this explains 
a part of the conflict in the childs psy che though the stork theory was never really taken 
seriously she accepted the fruitful re birth hypothesis according to which a person by dying 
assisted a child into life accordingly the mother too must die why then should the newborn 
child again st whom she already felt childish jealousy cause her pleasure it was for this reason 
that she had to ascertain in a favorable moment whether the mother was to die or rather was 
moved to express the hope that she would not die  
with this happy issue ho wever the re birth theory sustained a severe shock how was it possible 
now to explain the birth of her little brother and the origin of children in general there still 
remained the stork theory which though never expressly rejected had been implicitly  waived 
through the assumption of the re birth theory the explanations next attempted unfortunately 
remained hidden from the parents as the child stayed a few weeks with her grandmother from 
the grandmothers report we learned that the stork theory was o ften discussed and it was 
naturally re enforced by the concurrence of those about her  
when anna returned to her parents she again on meeting her mother evinced the same mixture of 
despair and suspicion which she had displayed after the birth the impres sion though 
inexplicable was quite unmistakable to both parents her behavior towards the baby was very 
nice during her absence a nurse had come into the house who on account of her uniform made 
a deep impression on anna to be sure the impression at first was quite unfavorable as she 
evinced the greatest hostility to her thus nothing could induce her to allow herself to be 
undressed and put to sleep by this nurse whence this resistance originated was soon shown in an 
angry scene near the cradle of t he little brother in which anna shouted at the nurse this is not 
your little brother it is mine gradually however she became reconciled to the nurse and 
began to play nurse herself she had to have her white cap and apron and nursed now her little  
brother and now her doll  
in contrast to her former mood she became unmistakably mournful and dreamy she often sat for 
a long time under the table singing and rhyming stories which were partially incomprehensible 
the association method

but sometimes contained the nurse them e i am a nurse of the green cross some of the 
stories how  p  ever distinctly showed a painful feeling striving for expression  
here we meet with a new and important feature in the little ones life that is we meet with 
reveries tendencies  towards the composition of poetry and melancholic attacks all these things 
which we are wont first to encounter at a later period of life at a time when the youthful person 
is preparing to sever the family tie and to enter independently upon life but is still held back by 
an inward painful feeling of homesickness and the warmth of the parental hearth at that time 
the youth begins to replace his longing with poetic fancies in order to compensate for the 
deficiency to approximate the psychology of a f ouryearold child to that of the age of puberty 
will at first sight seem paradoxical the relationship lies however not in the age but rather in the 
mechanism the elegiac reveries express the fact that a part of that love which formerly belonged 
and sh ould belong to a real object is now introverted  that is it is turned inward into the subject 
and there produces an increased imaginative activity what is the origin of this introversion  is it 
a psychological manifestation peculiar to this age or does it owe its origin to a conflict  
this is explained in the following occurrence it often happened that anna was disobedient to her 
mother she was insolent saying i am going back to grandma  
mother but i shall be sad when you leave me  
anna oh  but you have the little brother  
the effect which this produced on the mother shows what the little one was really aiming at with 
her threats to go away again she apparently wished to hear what her mother would say to her 
proposal that is to see what  attitude her mother would actually assume to her whether her little 
brother had not crowded her out altogether from her mothers favor one must however give no 
credence to this little trickster for the child could readily see and feel that despite th e existence 
of the little brother there was nothing essentially lacking for her in her mothers love the 
reproach to which she subjects her mother is therefore unjustified and to the trained ear this is 
betrayed by a slightly affected tone such a tone if  unmistakable shows that it does not expect to 
be taken seriously and hence it obtrudes itself re enforced the reproach as such must also not 
have been taken seriously by the mother for it was only the forerunner of other and this time 
more serious resis tances not long after the previously reported conversation the following scene 
took place  
mother come we are going into the garden now  
anna you are lying take care if you are not telling the truth  
p   
m what are you thinking of i al ways tell the truth  
a no you are not telling the truth  
m you will soon see that i am telling the truth we are going into the garden now  
a indeed is that true is that really true are you not lying  
scenes of this kind were repeated a n umber of times this time the tone was more rude and more 
penetrating and at the same time the accent on the word lie betrayed something special which 
the parents did not understand indeed at first they attributed too little significance to the 
sponta neous utterances of the child in this they merely did what education usually does with 
the association method  
get any book for free on   wwwabikacom  
official sanction one usually pays little heed to children in every stage of life in all essential 
matters they are treated as not responsible and in all unessentia l matters they are trained with 
an automatic precision  
under resistances there always lies a question a conflict of which we hear at later times and on 
other occasions but usually one forgets to connect the thing heard with the resistances thus on 
another occasion anna put to her mother the following difficult questions  
anna i should like to become a nurse when i grow big  
 why did you not become a nurse  
mother why as i have become a mother i have children to nurse anyway  
a reflecti ng indeed shall i be a different woman from you and shall i still speak to you  
the mothers answer again shows whither the childs question was really directed apparently 
anna too would like to have a child to nurse just as the nurse has where  the nurse got the 
little child is quite clear anna too could get a child in the same way if she were big why did 
not the mother become such a plain nurse that is to say how did she get a child if not in the 
same way as the nurse like the nurse ann a too could get a child but how that fact might be 
changed in the future or how she might come to resemble her mother in respect to getting 
children is not clear to her from this resulted the thoughtful question indeed shall i be a 
different woman f rom you shall i be different in every respect the stork theory evidently had 
come to naught the dying theory met a similar fate hence she now thinks one may get a child in 
the same way as for example the nurse got hers she too could get one in t his natural way but 
how about the mother who is no nurse and still has children looking at the matter at this point 
of view anna asks why did you not become a nurse namely why have you not got your 
child in the natural way this peculiar indirect  p  manner of questioning is typical and 
evidently corresponds with the childs hazy grasp of the problem unless we assume a certain 
diplomatic uncertainty prompted by a desire to evade direct questioning we shall later find an 
illustration of thi s possibility anna is evidently confronted with the question where does the 
child come from the stork did not bring it mother did not die nor did mother get it in the 
same way as the nurse she has however asked this question before and received th e 
information from her father that the stork brings children this is positively untrue she can never 
be deceived on this point accordingly papa and mama and all the others lie this readily 
explains her suspicion at the childbirth and her discrediting of her mother but is also explains 
another point namely the elegiac reveries which we have attributed to a partial introversion we 
know now from what real object love had to be taken and introverted to no purpose namely it 
had to be taken from the pa rents  who deceived her and refused to tell her the truth what must 
this be which cannot be uttered what else is going on here such were the parenthetic 
questions of the child and the answer was evidently this must be something to be concealed 
perha ps something dangerous attempts to make her talk and to draw out the truth by means of 
insidious questions were futile she exerted resistance against resistance and the introversion 
of love began it is evident that the capacity for sublimation in a  yearold child is still too 
slightly developed to be capable of performing more than symptomatic services the mind 
therefore depends on another compensation namely it resorts to one of the relinquished 
infantile devices for securing love by force th e most preferred is that of crying and calling the 
mother at night this has been diligently practised and exhausted during her first year it now

returns and corresponding to the period of life it has become well determined and equipped with 
recent impres sions it was just after the earthquakes in messina and this event was discussed at 
the table anna was extremely interested in everything she repeatedly asked her grandma to 
relate to her how the earth shook how the houses were demolished and many peop le lost their 
lives after this she had nocturnal fears she could not remain alone her mother was forced to go 
to her and stay with her otherwise she feared that an earthquake would appear that the house 
would fall and kill her during the day too sh e was much occupied with such thoughts while 
walking with her mother she annoyed her with such questions as will the house be standing 
when we return home are you sure there is no earthquake at home will papa still be living 
about every stone lying i n the road she asked whether it was from an p  earthquake a new 
building was a house destroyed by the earthquake etc she finally even cried out frequently at 
night that the earthquake was coming and that she heard the thunder in the evening she h ad to be 
solemnly assured that there was no earthquake coming  
many means of calming her were tried thus she was told for example that earthquakes only 
exist where there are volcanoes but then she had to be satisfied that the mountains surrounding 
the city were not volcanoes this reasoning gradually caused in the child an eager desire for 
learning strong but quite unnatural for her age which manifested itself in her requiring that all 
the geological atlases and text books should be brought her from her fathers library for hours 
she rummaged through these works looking for pictures of volcanoes and earthquakes and 
asking questions continually we are here confronted by an energetic effort to sublimate the fear 
into an eager desire for learning whi ch at this age made a decidedly premature exaction but as 
in many a gifted child which suffers from precisely the same difficulty many effects of this 
immature sublimation were surely not to her advantage for by favoring sublimation at this age 
one me rely enforces a fragment of neurosis the root of the eager desire for learning is the fear 
and the fear is the expression of a converted libido that is it is the expression of an introversion 
which henceforth becomes neurotic  which at this age is neith er necessary nor favorable for the 
development of the child  
whither this eager desire for learning was ultimately directed is explained by a series of 
questions which arose almost daily why is sophie a younger sister younger that i where 
was fredd y the little brother before was he in heaven what was he doing there why did he 
come down just now why not before  
this state of affairs induced the father to decide that the mother should tell the child when 
occasion offered the truth concerning th e origin of the little brother  this having been done 
anna soon thereafter asked about the stork her mother told her that the story of the stork was 
not true but that freddy grew up in his mother like the flowers in a plant at first he was very 
little and then he became bigger and bigger just like a plant she listened attentively without the 
slightest surprise and then asked but did he come out all by himself  
mother yes  
anna but he cannot walk  
sophie then he crawled out  
anna overh earing her little sisters answer  is there a hole here pointing to the breast or did 
he come out of the mouth who came out of the nurse she then interrupted p  herself 
the association method

and exclaimed no no the stork brought little brother down from heave n she soon left the 
subject and again wished to see pictures of volcanoes during the evening following this 
conversation she was calm the sudden explanation produced in the child a whole series of 
ideas which manifested themselves in certain questions  unexpected perspectives were opened 
she rapidly approached the main problem namely the question where did the child come out 
was it from a hole in the breast or from the mouth both suppositions are entirely qualified to 
form acceptable theories we even meet with recently married women who still entertain the 
theory of the hole in the abdominal wall or of the caesarean section this is supposed to betray a 
very curious form of innocence but as a matter of fact it is not innocence as we are alway s 
dealing in such cases with infantile sexual activities which in later life have brought the vias 
naturales into ill repute  
it may be asked where the child got the absurd idea that there is a hole in the breast or that the 
birth takes place through th e mouth why did she not select one of the natural openings existing 
in the abdomen from which things come out daily the explanation is simple very shortly 
before our little one had invited some educational criticism on her mothers part by a heightened  
interest in both abdominal openings with their remarkable products  an interest not always in 
accord with the requirements of cleanliness and decorum then for the first time she became 
acquainted with the exceptional laws of these bodily regions and b eing a sensitive child she 
soon learned that there was something here to be tabooed this region therefore must not be 
referred to anna had simply shown herself docile and had so adjusted herself to the cultural 
demands that she thought at least spoke  of the simplest things last the incorrect theories 
substituted for correct laws persisted for years until brusque explanations came from without it 
is therefore no wonder that such theories the forming of and adherence to which are favored 
even by p arents and educators should later become determinants of important symptoms in a 
neurosis or of delusions in a psychosis just as i have shown that in dementia praecox  what 
has existed in the mind for years always remains somewhere though it may be hidden under 
compensations seemingly of a different kind  
but even before this question whence the child really comes out was settled a new problem 
obtruded itself viz t he children come out of the mother but how is it with the nurse  
p  did some one come out also in this case this question was followed by the remark 
no no the stork brought down the little brother from heaven what is there peculiar about the  
fact that nobody came out of the nurse we recall that anna identified herself with the nurse and 
planned to become a nurse later for  she too would like to have a child and she could have 
one as well as the nurse but now when it is known that the little brother grew in mama how is it 
now  
this disquieting question is averted by a quick return to the stork angel theory which has never 
been really believed and which after a few trials is at last definitely abandoned two questions 
however remain in the air the first reads as follows where does the child come out the 
second a considerably more difficult one reads how does it happen that mama has children 
while the nurse and the servants do not all these questions did not at first manifest th emselves  
the association method

on the day following the explanation while at dinner anna spontaneously remarked my 
brother is in italy and has a house of cloth and glass but it does not tumble down  
in this case as in the others it was impossible to ask for an explanat ion the resistances were too 
great and anna could not be drawn into conversation this former officious and pretty 
explanation is very significant for some three months the two sisters had been building a 
stereotyped fanciful conception of a big brothe r this brother knows everything he can do and 
has everything he has been and is in every place where the children are not he is owner of great 
cows oxen horses dogs everything is his etc each sister has such a big brother we must 
not look far  for the origin of this fancy the model for it is the father who seems to correspond to 
this conception he seems to be like a brother to mama the children too have their similar 
powerful brother this brother is very brave he is at present in dange rous italy and inhabits an 
impossible fragile house and it does not tumble down  for the child this realizes an important 
wish the earthquake is no longer to be dangerous  as a consequence of this the childs fear 
disappeared and stayed away  the fear of  earthquakes now entirely vanished instead of calling 
her father to her bed to conjure away the fear she now became very affectionate and begged him 
every night to kiss her  
in order to test this new state of affairs the father showed her pictures illus trating volcanoes and 
earthquake devastations anna remained unaffected she examined the pictures with indifference 
remarking these people are dead i have already seen that quite often the picture of a 
volcanic eruption no longer had any attraction for her thus all her scientific interest collapsed 
and vanished as suddenly as it came during p  the days following the explanation anna 
had quite important matters to occupy herself with she disseminated her newly acquired 
knowledge among those a bout her in the following manner she began by again circumstantially 
affirming what had been told her viz that freddy she and her younger sister had grown in her 
mother that papa and mama grew in their mothers and that the servants likewise grew in  their 
respective mothers by frequent questions she tested the true basis of her knowledge for her 
suspicion was aroused in no small measure so that it needed many confirmations to remove all 
her uncertainties  
on one occasion the trustworthiness of th e theory threatened to go to pieces about a week after 
the explanation the father was taken sick with influenza and consequently had to remain in bed 
during the forenoon the children knew nothing about this and anna coming into the parents 
bedroom saw what was quite unusual namely that her father was remaining in bed she again 
took on a peculiar surprised expression she remained at a distance from the bed and would not 
come nearer she was apparently again reserved and suspicious but suddenly she b urst out with 
the question why are you in bed have you a plant in your belly too  
the father was naturally forced to laugh he calmed her however by assuring her that children 
never grow in the father that only women can have children and not men  thereupon the child 
again became friendly but though the surface was calm the problems continued to work in the 
dark a few days later while at dinner anna related the following dream i dreamed last night of 
noahs ark the father then asked her what she had dreamed about it but annas answer was 
sheer nonsense in such cases it is necessary only to wait and pay attention a few minutes later 
she said to her mother i dreamed last night about noahs ark and there were a lot of little 
the association method

animals in it  another pause she then began her story for the third time  i dreamed last night 
about noahs ark and there were a lot of little animals in it and underneath there was a lid and 
that opened and all the little animals fell out   
the children really had  a noahs ark but its opening a lid was on the roof and not underneath 
in this way she delicately intimated that the story of the birth from mouth or breast is incorrect 
and that she had some inkling where the children came out  
a few weeks then pass ed without any noteworthy occurrences on one occasion she related the 
following dream i dreamed about papa and mama they had been sitting late in the study and 
we children were there too on the face of p  this we find a wish of the children to  be 
allowed to sit up as long as the parents this wish is here realized or rather it is utilized to 
express a more important wish namely to be present in the evening when the parents are alone  
of course quite innocently it was in the study  where she ha s seen all the interesting books and 
where she has satiated her thirst for knowledge ie she was really seeking an answer to the 
burning question whence the little brother came if the children were there they would find 
out a few days later anna had a terrifying dream from which she awoke crying the 
earthquake was coming the house had begun to shake her mother went to her and calmed her 
by saying that the earthqu ake was not coming that everything was quiet and that everybody was 
asleep whereupon anna said  i would like to see the spring when all the little flowers are 
coming out and the whole lawn is full of flowers   i would like to see freddy he has such a  dear 
little face   what is papa doing what is he saying the mother said he is asleep and isnt 
saying anything now little anna then remarked with a sarcastic smile  he will surely be sick 
again in the morning   
this text should be read backwards  the last sentence was not meant seriously as it was uttered 
in a mocking tone when the father was sick the last time anna suspected that he had a plant in 
his belly the sarcasm signifies to morrow papa is surely going to have a child but this al so 
is not meant seriously papa is not going to have a child mama alone has children perhaps she 
will have another child tomorrow but where from what does papa do the formulation of the 
difficult problem seems here to come to the surface it reads what does papa really do if he does 
not bear children the little one is very anxious to have a solution for all these problems she 
would like to know how freddy came into the world she would like to see how the little flowers 
come out of the earth in th e spring and these wishes are hidden behind the fear of earthquakes  
after this intermezzo anna slept quietly until morning in the morning her mother asked her 
what she had dreamed she did not at first recall anything and then said  i dreamed that i could 
make the summer and then some one threw a punch  down into the closet   
this peculiar dream apparently has two different scenes which are separated by then the 
second part draws its material from the recent wish to possess a punch that is to p  have a 
masculine doll just as the mother has a little boy some one threw punch down into the closet 
one often lets other things fall down into the water closet it is just like this that the children too 
come out  we have here an analogy to the lumpf theory of little john  whenever several 
scenes are found in one dream each sc ene ordinarily represents a particular variation of the 
complex elaboration here accordingly the first part is only a variation of the theme found in the 
the association method

second part the meaning of to see the spring or to see the little flowers come out we have 
already seen anna now dreams that she can make the summer  that is she can bring it about that 
the little flowers shall come out she herself can make a little child and the second part of the 
dream represents this just like a passage of the bowels here we f ind the egotistic wish which is 
behind the seemingly objective interest of the nocturnal conversation  
a few days later the mother was visited by a lady who expected soon to become a mother the 
children seemed to take no interest in the matter but the n ext day they amused themselves with 
the following play which was directed by the older one they took all the newspapers they could 
find in their fathers paperbasket and stuffed them under their clothes so that the intention of the 
imitation was quite pl ain during the night little anna had another dream  i dreamed about a 
woman in the city she had a very big belly  the chief actor in the dream is always the dreamer 
himself under some definite aspect thus the childish play of the day before is fully s olved  
not long thereafter anna surprised her mother with the following performance she struck her 
doll under her clothes then pulled it out slowly head downwards and at the same time remarked 
look the little child is coming out it is now all out  by this means anna tells her mother you 
see thus i apprehend the problem of birth what do you think of it is that right the play is 
really meant to be a question for as we shall see later this conception had to be officially 
confirmed that rumi nation on this problem by no means ended here is shown by the occasional 
ideas conceived during the following weeks thus she repeated the same play a few days later 
with her teddy bear which functioned as an especially loving doll one day looking at a rose 
she said to her grandma see the rose is getting a baby as her grandma did not quite 
understand her she pointed to the enlarged calyx and said you see she is quite thick here  
anna once quarrelled with her younger sister and the latter p   angrily exclaimed i will 
kill you whereupon anna answered when i am dead you will be all alone then you will have 
to pray to the dear lord for a live baby but the scene soon changed anna was the angel and 
the younger sister was forced to kne el before her and pray to her that she should present to her a 
living child in this way anna became the presenting mother  
oranges were once served on the table anna impatiently asked for one and said  i am going to 
take an orange and swallow it all do wn into my belly and then i shall get a little child  who 
will not think here of the fairy tales in which childless women finally become pregnant by 
swallowing fruit fish and similar things  thus anna attempts to solve the problem how the 
children actually come into the mother  she thus enters into an examination which hitherto has 
not been formulated with so much sharpness the solution follows in the form of an analog y 
which is quite characteristic of the archaic thinking of the child in the adult too there is a kind 
of thinking by analogy which belongs to the stratum lying immediately below consciousness 
dreams bring the analogies to the surface the same may be  observed also in dementia praecox 
in german as well as in numerous foreign fairy tales one frequently finds such characteristic 
childish comparisons fairy tales seem to be the myths of the child and therefore contain among 
other things the mythology w hich the child weaves concerning the sexual processes the spell of 
the fairy tale poetry which is felt even by the adult is explained by the fact that some of the old 
theories are still alive in our unconscious minds we experience a strange peculiar a nd familiar

feeling when a conception of our remotest youth is again stimulated without becoming 
conscious it merely sends into consciousness a feeble copy of its original emotional strength  
the problem how the child gets into the mother was difficult t o solve as the only way of taking 
things into the body is through the mouth it could evidently be assumed that the mother eats 
something like a fruit which then grows in her belly but then comes another difficulty namely 
it is clear enough what the mo ther produces but it is not yet clear what the father is good for  
what does the father do anna now occupied herself exclusively with this question one 
morning she ran into the parents bedroom while they were dressing she jumped into her fathers 
bed she lay down on her belly and kicked with her legs and called at the same time look does 
papa do p  that  the analogy to the horse of little john which raised such disturbance 
with its legs is very surprising  
with this last performance the  solving of the problem seemed to rest entirely at least the parents 
found no opportunity to make any pertinent observations that the problem should come to a 
standstill just here is not at all surprising for this is really its most difficult part more over we 
know from experience that not very many children go beyond these limits during the period of 
childhood the problem is almost too difficult for the childish reason which still lacks must 
irremissible knowledge without which the problem cannot be s olved  
this standstill lasted about five months during which no phobias or other signs of complex 
elaboration appeared after the lapse of this time there appeared premonitory signs of some new 
incidents annas family lived at that time in the country ne ar a lake where the mother and 
children could bathe as anna feared to wade farther into the water than kneedeep her father 
once put her into the water which led to an outburst of crying in the evening while going to bed 
anna asked her mother do you n ot believe that father wanted to drown me a few days later 
there was another outburst of crying she continued to stand in the gardeners way until he finally 
placed her in a newly dug hole anna cried bitterly and afterwards maintained that the gardener  
wished to bury her to finish up with anna awoke during the night with fearful crying her 
mother went to her in the adjoining room and quieted her anna dreamed that a train passed and 
then fell in a heap  
we have here repeated the stage coach of  little john these incidents showed clearly enough 
that there was again fear in the air ie that there again had arisen a resistance against the 
transposition on the parents and that therefore a larger part of the love was converted into fear 
this ti me suspicion was directed not against the mother but against the father who she was sure 
must know the secret but would never let anything out what could the father be secreting or 
doing to the child this secret appeared as something dangerous so tha t she felt the worst might 
be expected from the father this feeling of childish anxiety with the father as object we see 
again most distinctly in adult especially in dementia praecox which lifts the veil of obscurity 
from many unconscious processes as  though it were following psychanalytic principles it was 
for this reason that anna apparently came to the very absurd conclusion that her father wanted to 
drown her at the same time her fear contained the thought that the object of the father had some 
relation to a dangerous p  action  this stream of thought is no arbitrary interpretation 
anna meanwhile grew up a little and her interest for her father took on a special coloring which

is hard to describe language possesses no words to describe th e very special kind of affectionate 
curiosity which radiated from the childs eyes  
anna once took marked delight in assisting the gardener while he was sowing grass without 
apparently divining the profound significance of the childs play about a fortn ight later she 
began to observe with great pleasure the sprouting young grass on one of these occasions she 
asked her mother the following question tell me how did the eyes grow into the head the 
mother told her that she did not know anna however continued to ask whether the lord or her 
papa could tell this the mother then referred her to the father who might tell her how the eyes 
grew into the head a few days later there was a family reunion at a tea and after everything was 
over the guests de parted the father remained at the table reading the paper and anna also 
remained suddenly approaching her father she said tell me how did the eyes grow into the 
head father they did not   grow into the head they were there from the beginning and g rew 
with the head  
a were not the eyes planted  
f no they grew in the head like the nose  
a did the mouth and the ears grow in the same way and the hair too  
f yes they all grew in the same way  
a and the hair too but the mousies came into the world naked where was the hair before 
were there no seeds added  
f no you see the hair really came out of little grains which are like seeds but these were 
already in the skin long before and nobody sowed them the father was now ge tting concerned 
he knew whither the little ones thoughts were directed but he did not wish to overthrow for the 
sake of a former false application the opportunely established seed theory which she had most 
fortunately gathered from nature but the chi ld spoke with an unwonted seriousness which 
demanded consideration  
anna evidently disappointed and with a distressed tone but how did freddy get into mama 
who stuck him in and who stuck you into your mama where did he come out from  
from this su dden storm of questions the father chose the last for his first answer just think you 
know well enough that freddy is a boy boys become men and girls women only women and 
not men can have children now just think where could freddy come out from  
p  a laughs joyfully and points to her genitals did he come out here  
father yes of course you certainty must have thought of this before  
a overlooking the question but how did freddy get into mama did anybody plant him 
was the se ed planted  
this very precise question could no longer be evaded by the father he explained to the child 
who listened with the greatest attention that the mother is like the soil and the father like the 
gardener that the father provides the seed whic h grows in the mother and thus gives origin to a 
baby this answer gave extraordinary satisfaction she immediately ran to her mother and said 
papa has told me everything now i know it all she did not however tell what she knew

the new knowledge was however put into play the following day anna went to her mother and 
said think mama papa told me how freddy was a little angel and was brought from heaven by 
a stork the mother was naturally surprised and said no you are mistaken papa sure ly never 
told you such a thing whereupon the little one laughed and ran away  
this was apparently a mode of revenge her mother did not wish or was not able to tell her how 
the eyes grew into the head hence she did not know how freddy got into her it was for this 
reason that she again tempted her with the old story  
i wish to impress firmly upon parents and educators this instructive example of child 
psychology in the learned psychological discussions on the childs psyche we hear nothing about 
those  parts which are so important for the health and naturalness of our children nor do we hear 
more about the childs emotions and their conflicts and yet they play a most important rle  
it very often happens that children are erroneously treated as quite  imprudent and irrational 
beings thus on indulgently remarking to an intelligent father whose  yearold daughter 
masturbated excessively that care should be exercised in the presence of the child which slept in 
the same room with the parents i receive d the following indignant reply i can absolutely assure 
you that the child knows nothing about sexual matters this would recall that distinguished old 
neurologist who wished to abjudicate the attribute sexual from a childbirth phantasy which was 
represented in a dreamy state  
on the other hand a child evincing a neurotic talent exaggerated by neurosis may be urged on by 
solicitous parents how easy and tempting it would have been eg in the pres  p  ent case 
to admire excite and develop p rematurely the childs eager desire for learning and thereby 
develop an unnatural blas  state and a precociousness masking a neurosis in such cases the 
parents must look after their own complexes and complex tendencies and not make capital out of 
them at  the expense of the child the idea should be dismissed once for all that children are held 
in bondage by or that they are the toys of their parents they are characteristic and new beings 
in the matter of enlightenment on things sexual it can be affirm ed they suffer from the 
preconceived opinion that the truth is harmful many neurologists are of the opinion that even in 
grownups enlightenment on their own psychosexual processes is harmful and even immoral 
would not the same persons perhaps refuse to a dmit the existence of the genitals themselves  
one should not however go from this extreme of prudishness to the opposite one namely that 
of enlightenment   tout prix  which may turn out as foolish as it is disagreeable in this respect i 
believe the u se of some discretion to be decidedly the wiser plan still if children come upon any 
idea they should be deceived no more than adults  
i hope ladies and gentlemen that i have shown you what complicated psychic processes the 
psychanalytic investigation  reveals in the child and how great is the significance of these 
processes for the mental well being as well as for the general psychic development of the child 
what i have been unable to show you is the universal validity of these observations 
unfortun ately i am not in a position to show this for i do not know myself how much of it is 
universally valid only the accumulation of such observations and a more far reaching 
penetration into the problem thus broached will give us a complete insight into the laws of the

psychic development it is to be regretted that we are at present still far from this goal but i 
confidently hope that educators and practical psychologists whether physicians or deep thinking 
parents will not leave us too long unassisted in  this immensely important and interesting field
