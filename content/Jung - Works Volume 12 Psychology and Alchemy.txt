volume  psycho logy and alchemy 
 introduction to the religious and psychological problems of alchemy  in jung c collected 
works of c g jung vol  nd ed prin ceton university press   p p  
a study of the relationship between alchemy and the psychic process of indivi duation is presented the 
need to address the problems of the psyche is based on the fact that the psyche is still one of the most 
mysterious regions of experience observation of people points to the myster y of the psyche and the 
psychotherapeutic process itself c onstantly reveals that the object of the search for both doctor and 
patient is the discovery of the w hole mana greater man in the futu re the difficulty and dangers of 
this search are explored and the potentiality for whol eness in the true christian imitatio christi is 
explained an exhaustive discussion of the relationship between religion and the psyche is included 
with emphasis on the religious natu re of the soul and on the contri bution that psychology can make to 
arriving at a better understanding of  religious truths a comparison is made between the archetypes of 
the unconscious and religious dogmas with stress on the importance of the christ symbol as an 
expression of the union of opposites the alchemic view  of the soul and the g odhead is presented and 
contrasted with the christian view in alchemy the search was also dir ected toward the discovery of the 
seed of unity as is the psychotherapeutic process the goal of this latter process is stated as enabling the 
patient to be alone with the self the methods da ngers and difficulties of arriving at this goal are 
discussed reference is made to a dialogue between th e patient and his shadow which is to be followed 
by the study of a series of dreams containing mandala  symbols of the center or the goal it is in 
developing these symbols that the h ealing process or the solution for th is particular person emerges an 
attempt is made to introduce the symbolism of alchemy and to relate it to christianity gnosticism and 
the psychotherapeutic process

in introducing a study of symbols of  the individuation process as gath ered from dream material their 
nature as images of an archetype  depicting the production of a new cen ter of personalit y is reasserted 
this center is called the self iethe center of  the psyche containing bot h the conscious and the 
unconscious the images that refer directly and excl usively to this new cent er as it comes into 
consciousness belong to a category referred to as mandala symbolism a series of such symbols 
arranged in chronological order and taken from over a thousand dreams and visu al impressions produced 
by a young man educated as a scientist is presented for purposes of this study the first  dreams and 
visions covering a period of nearly  months ar e examined in order to  provide conditions of 
unprejudiced observation and recordi ng a student undertook the observati on of the process with the 
young man the belief that interpretation of dreams cannot be approached with  preconceived notions 
about what is meant by any unconsci ous expression is repeated here it should be assumed that every 
dream and every part of a dream is  unknown at the outset therefore at tempts at interpretation can be 
made only after making a careful examination of the context in which it appears

process of individuation these archetypal images are re ferred to as mandala symbolism the purpose of 
interpreting these initial dreams is to indicate th e way in which the mandala symbolism makes a very

an explanation of the origin of the mandala is gi ven and reasons are provided to justify the choice of 
this term in describing dreams and visions in which th e self is symbolized the mandala is the ritual or 
magic circle used in lamaism in tantric yoga it is a yantra or aid to contemplation the lamaic view 
of the mandala is presented by means of a report of a conversation with a lamaic  priest that took place 
in  according to this view a mandala is a mental  image that can be created only by an instructed 
lama through the power of imagination no mandala is like any other all are individual thus physical 
representations of the mandala f ound in monasteries and temples have  no real significance the true 
mandala is always a mental image  despite the alleged individual form ation of lamaic mandalas it is 
noted that a certain unmistakable st yle and structure predominate for example they are all based on a 
quaternary system and their contents are derived fr om lamaic dogma a strict distinction is made 
between the lamaic mandala the khilkor and the si dpekorlo or buddhist world wheel the latter is 
based on a tertiary system in which the three world pr inciples are represented it  is asserted that these 
eastern symbols were not invented by religious leader s but that they originated in dreams and visions 
their widespread distribution across cultures is cited as evidence mandalas used in ceremonies are of 
great significance because their centers usually cont ain important religious figures eg shiva or the 
buddha if as surmised mandalas symbol ize a psychic center of  the personality that is separate from the 
ego the high value placed on them  is justified i reference

extracts of  dreams and visions out  of a continous series of more than  dreams obtained from the 
analysis of a young man are presente d these excerpts were chosen for interpretation because they 
provide clear evidence of mandala symbolism images of the circle frequently recur and are interpreted 
as the symbol for the center of the personality the mi rror image is seen as a simile for the intellect 
several of the symbols lend themselves to divisi on into a quaternity whic h suggests a relation to 
alchemical symbols for this reas on alchemic writings are cited to show the connections between the 
meaning behind the dream symbols and the meaning of  such alchemical terms as lapis philosophorum 
king sol niger and others the progress of the stri ving of the unconcious to reach consciousness is 
charted by means of the dream symbols with special at tention given to the symbols of conflict that this 
emerging of the unconscious evokes in the dream refe rences to a glass contai ning gelatinous material 
and to the uterus an acceptance of the anima as part  of the dreamers own psyche is seen the approach 
to reality takes the form of images related to speci fic time and place the conclusion is drawn that the 
symbols eagle and ship depict the cons ciousness transcending self  references

the great vision of a young ma n underlying analysis whose  dreams  of which are recorded in this 
volume were analyzed by a student of jungs is exam ined in detail because of the impression of most 
sublime harmony that it produced in the dreamer two heterogeneous systems interesting in the self and 
standing in a functional relationshi p to one another are revealed indi cating the dreamers desire for the 
most complete union of opposites that is possible th e vision that of a world clock is described as a 
three dimensional mandala a symbol of realization of the self it is hypothesized that disparate and 
incongruous elements have combined in this vision to produce an image that realizes the intentions of 
the unconscious in the highest degree material fr om astrology myth and religion is used in the 
interpretation of the vision special reference is made  to the writings of guil laume de digulleville a 
norman poet in explicating the significance of the world clock image  references

the development of the cent ral symbol in a dream seri es produced in analysis is discussed this process 
might be described in terms of a spiral process with the unconscious moving around a center gradually 
coming closer to it while the characteristics of th e center grow more distinct on the other hand the 
center in itself virtually unknowable might be seen  as a magnet acting on the disparate elements and 
processes of the unconscious the apparent quaternity of  the central symbol is discussed with reference 
to numerous historical and ethnological  parallels upon examining such evidence it is concluded that 
there is some psychic element expressing itself th rough the quaternity the element is named the self 
the archetypal nature of manda la symbolism is examined it is felt that  the facts are better served if it is 
assumed that the increase in the clarity and frequenc y of the mandala motif is due to a more accurate 
perception of an already existing type rather than to something generated in the course of the dream

  p p   
a brief review of the causes for the demise of alch emy is presented followed  by a description of the 
alchemical process and goal although the th centu ry spirit of enlightenme nt and the scientific 
discovery of chemistry could be appl ied to explain the death of alchem y the real cause resided in its 
own increasing obscurity resulting from devotion to the allegories and speculations of hermetic 
philosophy despite its inability to su rvive into the scientific ages al chemy is seen to merit attention 
because of the psychic projections c ontained in the writings of its prac titioners that the art was filled 
with psychic projections is evidenced by the fact that although alchemy was a chemical process the 
description and ingredients of this process varied from author to author there were however four 
stages posited by all the alchemists in the beginning and these were characterized by the four colors 
black white yellow red in the th century yellow was eliminated the initial state nigredo may be 
produced by the separation of elements then the uni on of opposites comunctio is performed followed 
by the death of the product of this union mortificatio  from this the washing baptisma leads to the 
albedo or whiteness and the release of the soul at the death of the last stage and its reunion with the 
body this was considered to be the first goal of the process the si lver or moon condition red was 
produced by intensifying the fire and the gold or sun was the result of the  chymical wedding of red 
and white symbolic of the king and queen just as  the processes varied so did the conceptions and 
symbols of the goal certain charact eristics were held by all however  fire and water and the hermetic 
vessel for instance were commonly associated with the prima materia and the storie the characteristics 
of each of these s ymbols were often paradoxical and even antithetical to one another yet all had a 
symbolic significance in  joseph quercetanus established a sequence of  twelve operations but 
since each of the twelve was open to multiple defini tion the variations remained  almost infinite it is 
concluded that although alchemy produ ced very little in terms of the knowledge of modern chemistry it 
was a process filled with a sense of  adventure due to the constant excitement of the quest and the hope 
of discovering the preci ous gold  references

jung vol  nd ed princeton univ ersity press   p p   
it is asserted that the alchemical opus deals less wi th chemical experiments as such than with what is 
described as  something resembli ng psychic processes expressed in pseudochemical language it is 
proposed that the real root of al chemy lies not in philosophical doctr ine but in the pr ojections of the 
individual investigator by this is meant that  the investigator while working on his chemical 
experiments had certain psychic experi ences that appeared to him as part  of the actual chemical process 
as this is a matter of psychological project ion and therefore unconscious the alchemist would 
experience his projection as a pr operty of matter thus he was in reality experiencing his own 
unconscious excerpts from several alchemic manuscr ipts are presented in support of the notion that 
psychic projection of unconscious material onto chemical substances  is the key to understanding the 
alchemic opus  references

g jung vol  nd ed princeton univer sity press   p p   
the psyches relation to alchemical work in terms  of the psychological requirements of the individual 
alchemist is examined a number of passages from al chemic literature are presented these examples 
indicate that in order for the opus to be successf ul the operator must be in possession of a proper 
psychological set this evidence is interpreted as indicating that the alchem ic authors believed the 
essential secret of their art to lie hidden in the human mind or what is termed the unconscious in 
analytical psychology it is observed that the texts stress the importance of understanding and 
intelligence not only because superior inteffigence is  needed in the performance of the art but because 
it is assumed that a species of ma gical power capable of transforming even brute matter dwells in the 
human mind it is pointed out th at alchemy from its beginning ha d a dual nature on the one hand it 
was a chemical work on the other it was a psychol ogical process its psychi c nature was partially 
conscious and partially the result of  unconscious projections as is seen  in the various transformations of 
matter this close connection betwee n the psyche of the investigator and the alchemical work can also 
be seen in the emphasis placed on the mental attitude of the worker and on the virtues he was exhorted 
to cultivate  references

jung vol  nd ed princeton univ ersity press   p p   
an explication of the specific uses of the terms meditatio and imaginatio is  undertaken with special 
reference to rulands lexicon alchemiae ruland s definition of meditati o proves beyond doubt that 
when alchemists speak of meditari they do not simp ly mean meditation or cog itation but explicitly an 
inner dialogue implying a living relati onship with the  answering voice of the other in ourselves ie 
of the unconscious several other te xts are cited to substantiate this  explanation rulands lexicon also 
provides clarification of th e particular importance of  the term imaginatio in the alchemic opus the act 
of ima gining imaginatio  was perceived as an activit y that did not sim ply create fantas y but rather as 
producing something more corporeal a subtle body semi spiritual in nature the imaginatio was thus a 
physical activity that could be fitted into the cycle of chemical or material changes in this way the 
alchemist related himself not only to the conscious but  directly to the very substance which he hoped to 
transform through the pow er of imagination  
 religious ideas in alchemy an historical su rvey of alchemical ideas  the psychic nature 
of the alchemical work iv soul and body  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  nd 
ed princeton university pr ess   p p   
the meaning of the terms soul and body and their relation to each other in alchemical thought are 
examined the soul or anima corporalis is seen  as corresponding to the unc onscious if this is 
understood to be the psychic phenomenon that medi ates between consciousness and the physiological 
functions of the body the fusion of opposites is characte ristic of every psychic event in the unconscious 
state thus the anima corporalis is also spiritualis according to alchemical lite rature the soul is only 
partly confined in the body an analogy to god being only partly enclosed in the body of the world as 
gods imagining is seen as the act of creation the imaginatio in alchemic te rms gives the key to the 
goal of alchemy to project and make actual those contents of the unconscious which do not exist in 
nature the contents of the unconscious have an a priori archetypal character the medium through 
which this goal is realized is ne ither mind nor matter body nor soul  but a realm of subtle reality 
adequately expressed only by the symbol since the latt er is neither abstract nor concrete rational nor 
irrational real nor unreal  but both  references

  p p   
the nature of the alchemical work is described and reasons are given to explain its obscurity part of 
work the operatio was practical in the sense that it dealt with a series of chemical experiments yet it 
remained shrouded in obscurity due to the fact that  each alchemist built an individual edifice of ideas 
composed of the sayings of the philosophers and anal ogies to the basic tenets of alchemy at the same 
time the alchemist was interested in creating a nome nclature that would describe psychic as well as 
physical transformations the result ing amplification amplificatio of  the procedures which consists 
primarily of philosophical and reli gious analogies is the second part  of the opus and was ternied the

work  references

spirit in matter  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  nd ed princeton university 
press   p p   
the alchemic notion of the spirit in  matter is discussed with particul ar reference to the writings of 
zosimos nietzschean metaphors are al so used to express the idea that in antiquity the material world 
was considered to be filled with the projection of a psychic secret which from then on appeared as the 
secret of matter and remained so  until the decay of alchemy in the th century the alchemists 
searched for this secret spirit in the marvellous stone  lapis lazub that transf orms base metals into noble 
ones by a process of coloration as quicksilver approxi mates this process this spirit substance was 
called mercurius the possessor of this penetrating mercurius can project it into other substances and 
transform them from the imperfect to the perfect st ate the analogy  between alchemical work and the 
projection of unconscious psyc hic content is explored the point is made that this unconscious content 
up to the present has rarel y been attributed to an y human personalit y the notable exce ption bein g 
christ pagan projections on the other hand go beyond ma n to the material world the realm of inanimate 
matter the alchemical work reflects the influence of  both pagan and christian tr aditions  references

the nature of man as both the one to be redeemed a nd the redeemer is discussed man as the one to be 
redeemed is the christian formulation man as rede emer is alchemical the symbolism and language of 
the mass is examined in some detail it is pointed  out that when the priest pronounces the consecrating 
words to bring about the transformation that re deems the bread and wine from their elemental 
imperfection he is in  essence an alchemist and not a christia n the point is made that in both the 
church and in alchemy the work is that of redemption with the alchemist particip ating in two roles that 
of the redeemer as we ll as that of the re deemed  references

in the discussion of the prima materia the basis of the alchemical wor k it is proposed that this prima 
materia represents the unknown substance embodying or  carrying the projection of  psychic content for 
this reason the substance cannot be  specified because the projection emanates from  the individual and is 
thus necessarily different in  each case it is incorrect to maintain that alchemists never defined the prima 
materia on the contrary all too many proposed their definitions as a result there exist many 
synonyms for this term including words for chemic al mythological and phi losophical substances 
that are briefly examined  here  references

the nature of the prima materia as ra dix ipsius root of itself is disc ussed with special reference to the 
paracelsan idea of the increatum icthat the prima materia is unique and myst erious in that it is 
uncreated the philosophical implica tions of this view especially the implied equality of the prima 
materia with the deity enabled alch emists to project the highest valu e  god  into matter this 
elevation of matter is seen as the starting point for the developmen t of both modern chemistry and

the nature of the prima materia is  discussed in terms of the qualiti es of ubiquity and perfection with 
the writings of george ripley an english alchemis t as a primary source pa ssages are quoted  describing 
the prima materia as being in every place and in ev ery time eternal and limitless comment is made on 
the views held by ripley and other cosmological theori sts who maintained that  the prima materia had a 
perfect spherical nature a nature ac quired when it emerged from the sw irling chaos it is this perfect 
roundness which resulted in the prima ma teria being often referred to as lapis as the la pis is initially 
in the hidden state and can be transmitted through the art and the grace of god into the second 
manifest state it is often seen as  coincidental with the initial sta ge of the alchemical process the 
nigredo  references

iv the king and the kings son  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  nd ed 
princeton university press   p p   
the mythical theme of the king and the kings son is disc ussed as it relates to the prima materia basic to 
this myth are the images of the inanimate king in whose land nothing is begotten and the kings son is 
trapped at the bottom of the sea this first image is interpreted as  a description of the latency and 
potentiality of the hidden state the darkness of the sea is seen as a re presentation of the depths of the 
unconscious thus when the king cries for help from his unconscious dissociated  state it is to the 
conscious mind that this plea is ad dressed the rescue necessitates a de scent into the dark world of the 
unconscious the dangerous night sea journey whose end and aim is the restoratio n of life and triumph 
over death the legend of aris leus is cited as an example of this th eme with attention given to the incest 
theme iethe union of opposites which is the ca use of the death this death was interpreted by the 
alchemists as the completion of the spirit s descent into matter  references

the myth of the hero with exampl es taken from the arisleus legend is presented as an analogy of the 
descent into the unconscious with all its attendant danger the purpose of the descent as universally 
exemplified in the myth of the hero is to demons trate that only in the region of great danger can one 
find the treasure hard to attain t he jewel the life potion lapis triumph over death etc the dread 
and resistance that arise when any normal human being begins to delve deeply into himself is analogous 
to the mythical journey to hades with its attendant fear the disintegration described in the myth of 
gabricius is a repetition of the c oniunctio of nous and physis expres sed in terms of a personal crisis 
brought about by the intervention of the alchemic philosophers the philosopher makes the descent into 
hell as a redeemer   references

university press   p p   
some of the various ways in which alchemists symbol ized the hidden treasure or the treasure hard to 
attain believed to be present in the dark prima materia are examined among these are christopher of 
paris notion that this substance is potentially presen t in the chaos of the prima materia as a mass of all 
the elements combined into one johannes grassens held that the white dove called the salt of the 
metals was contained within the lead plumbum of  the philosophers valentinus believed that like a 
reflection in a mirror the treasure is an invisible spirit intangible yet th e root of all substances 
necessary for alchemy in a similar view michael maier expressed the belief that the sun in its 
revolutions spins gold into the earth as the sun is th e image of god the heart is the suns image in man 
and god is known in the gold this golden image of god is the anima aurea which when breathed into 
common quicksilver changes it into gold  references

the nature of the s pirit hidden in the prima materia is discussed in li ght of christian m ysticism this 
divine spirit is seen as the psyc hological equivalent of th e projection of unconscious content the task of 
alchemy was to make visible this hidden spirit si nce this work was contaminated by the unconscious 
projection of the alchemist it was at the same time a psychic activity compared to what is termed active 
imagination the parallel is drawn be tween the legend of arisleus in which salvation is obtained from 
an immortal fruit possessing miracul ous regenerating effect s and the ecclesiast ic symbolism of the 
mass this parallel eventually breaks down in that the christian receives the fruit of the mass for his 
own personal redemption whereas the alchemist receives the  immortal fruit not merely for himself but 
first and foremost for the ki ng or the kings son that is in order to perfect the coveted substance it is 
asserted that without knowing it the alchemist carries the imitation of christ imitatio a stage further 
and in a sense assimilates the rede emer as this process is carried out on the unconscious level the 
alchemist can be said to project this correspondenc e to the redeemer onto his wondrous stone the

the christ of this text is a gnostic son of god the parallel seems to be evident for instance the son of

literature is identical with adam who is a quatern ity compounded of four different earths he is the 
anthropos the first man symbolized by the four elemen ts as is the lapis sim ilar analogies are found in 
the myths of osiris herakles and enoch prometheus and epim etheus like christ and adam 
correspond to the inner and outer man while the ability to become all attributed  by the gnostics to the 
son of god is reflected in the alchemical mercur ius these numerous parallels indicate that the 
lapischrist motif of alchemy had it s roots in gnosticism even to th e point where the alchemic meaning 
of the opus can be compared with the gnos tic mystery of redemp tion  references

the epigoni refers to a group of th century alch emists who wrote during the full flowering of the 
alchemic tradition as well as the beginnings of its downfall it was in this century that the physical 
aspects of alchem y began to s plit from its more philoso phical and m ystical elements exam ples of the 
lapischrist parallel from this literature are presented it is noted  that in addition to providing evidence 
for this parallel the epigoni make clear that the re al aim of alchemy was to produce a corpus subtile a 
transfigured and resurrected body a body that was at the same time spirit this is compared with 
chinese alchemy with its main concern for the dia mond body that is the attainment of immortality 
through the transformation of the body the rise of secret societies in the lth century eg the 
rosicnicians is mentioned as evidence of the decl ine of alchemy such societ ies are seen as no more 
than guardians of a secret that has lost its vitality  and can only be kept alive as an outward form

the symbolism that remained preval ent even after the scientific break  between alchemy and chemistry is 
seen as an indication that such symbolism is an expre ssion of an essential part of the psyche it is seen as 
fitting that the relationships of this symbol ism to the psyche was unknown for the paradoxical 
statements made in the literature of alchemy on th e prima materia are intuitions about the paradoxical 
nature of the unconscious it follows then that the  only place where intuitions  of this kind could be 
lodged was in the unknown aspect of things be it ma tter or man alchemic li terature often indicated 
that the secret the prima materia might be found in some strange creature or in part of mans brain it 
was thought of as an ever changing substance or as th e essence of such a substance this substance was 
designated mercurius and was thought to be a paradoxical double substance known variously as 
monstrum hermaphroditus or rebis  the lapischrist parallel can be  seen as establishing an analogy 
between this substance a nd christ  references

the example of the unicorn is chosen to illustrate how the symbolism of mercur ius is intermingled with 
the traditions of pagan gnosticism and of the christ ian church as the unicorn is not a single clearly 
defined entity more specific conc ern is centered on the theme of th e beast with a single horn the a
icorn examples are given from th e literature esp the chymical we dding of rosencreutz in which the 
unicorn the lion and the white dove appear all of thes e beasts being symbols of mercurius reference is 
also made to medieval art in which images of the unico rn and the virgin appear these images are said to 
represent the dual aspect of mercurius the virgin as  the passive feminine aspect and the unicorn or the 
lion the wild rampant masculine force because the symbol of the unicorn as an allegory of christ and 
the holy ghost was also current in th e middle ages it is felt that alchem ical literature of this period in 
using this symbol establishes the mercur iuschrist identification  references

allegories in the church is in the psalms where the horn of the unicorn signifies  the health strength and

variously identified with the god of  the old testament and with christ it is pointed out that there are 
ecclesiastical quotations in which the unicorn is said to c ontain the element of evil it is this inner 
contradiction that makes the unicorn an appropriate symbol to be used by the alchemists monstrum

the relationship between the myster ies of alchemy and the psychology of the unconscious are discussed 
the latter is considered to be th e only source for understanding the me aning of the alchemic lapis in 
attempting to understand the psychology of alchemi cal thought it is necessary to begin from the 
standpoint of the psyche the contents of the chemical  research of the alchemis ts were a projection of 
empirical collective archet ypes the alchemic need for a redeemin g substance reflected the 
psychological necessity of uniting the opposites this al chemic need is contrasted with the christian 
view of the redeemer the former sought its solution in  the individual or the pers onality the latter in the 
collective or society goethes faust and nietzsches zarathustra are given as ex amples of what happens 
when identification with the thing to be transforme d takes place the result was an inflation of ego 
consciousness a paradoxical regression into un consciousness that is produced when the ego 
consciousness takes too many unconscious contents upon itself and loses the power of discrimination 
to avoid such a catastrophe a catastrophe that can ta ke on universal form as is evidenced in the second 
world war it is deemed necessary to recognize that there are contents of the unconscious which do not 
belong to the ego consciousness but to a psychic nonego a collective unconscious apparent in the 
archetypes of poets and philosophers the alchemists  attempts to find a panacea is regarded as a 
projection of the process of indivi duation a process that is still shr ouded in mystery since it is 
concerned with the centralizing proce sses in the unconscious that go to fo rm personality it is considered 
doubtful that reason alone will be capable of resolv ing this mystery only experience can grasp the 
significance of these processes the study of dream symbols with which this volume was concerned is 
an example of how this experience looks in realit y it is one way of showing what happens when an 
earnest inquiry is turned upon the unknown regions of the soul
