 psychology and religion  the autonomy of the unconscious  in jung c collected works 
of c g jung vol  nd ed princeton university press   p p  
in the terry lectures given at yale university in  a demonstration is proposed of the persective 
from which medical psychology views religion religi on must be taken into account by psychologists 
since it represents one of the most ancient and universal expr essions of the human mind but it is felt that 
the approach of psychology must be scientif ic empirical and phenomenological rather than 
philosophical or metaphysical religion is defined for the purposes of this study as the belief in an 
external dynamic force which controls the human subject  and as the ritual acts carried out by men to 
produce the effect of this dynamic force the numinosum  religion is seen as an attitude of mind rather 
than any creed although the creed is a codified form of  the original religious e xperience in the story of 
a patient who was convinced he had cancer but whose re al difficulty lay in obse ssive drives he did not 
want to recognize the desire of men in general to  avoid revelatory contact with the unconscious is 
stressed from primitive times to the present man is  seen to construct ritual and taboo to protect him 
from the voices of his dreams and the content of his unconscious the definite forms and laws of the 
church are seen in this light two dreams with specif ically religious manifestations are briefly analyzed 
to demonstrate the existence of these inner voices a nd experiences particularly the two figures of the 
anima and animus each is seen as a psychic repr esentation of the minority of genes in the body the 
anima or female figure appears in the imagery of th e males unconscious and vice versa it is felt that 
the processes of the unconscious ar e just as continuously active as those of the conscious mind and that 
dreams are manifestations of this chain of events that  can be experienced in the conscious i reference

the importance of drea m analysis as a means of contacting the unc onscious is stressed in an account of 
the therapy of a particular patient  a scientist who had numerous drea ms of a religious or mystical 
character the unconscious is seen as the comp letion and enrichment of the personality having a 
superior insight and knowledge lacki ng in the conscious self the integr ation of all parts of the mind is 
considered the ideal goal of therapy the catholic  defenses against immediate experience and its 
ambiguity in the particular case cited are simila r to other religious dogma and pagan ritual which 
represent the formalized actingout of psychic material so that the individual need not confront that 
material directly immediately in  his own unconscious it is obser ved that protestantism having 
divested itself of much of the ritual and codes of the catholic church leaves the individual to confront 
his sins alone this development has led to the un easiness and anxiety but al so to the alertness and 
analytic nature of modem society the dreams reported in the case study are examined for their 
archetypal material those primordial ideas or tendencies of thought which are common to all human 
psychic experience the significance of the number  four represented in one dream by a pyramidal 
shape is discussed in its many manifestations in other dreams a nd in the history of myth and religious 
thought other alchemical symbols a ssociated with the number four ar e the circle and the philosophers 
stone the latter symbol of the perf ect living being is found to be an allegory of the deity repeated by a 
number of early theorists the christian representa tion of god and the trinit y is compared to other 
systems in which the deity is repr esented by the unity of four elements the missing fourth element in 
rehgious doctrine is seen as the devil although this fourth elemen t is suppressed in the christian 
religion in an expression of certain moral and ment al attitudes of the prac titioners the unconscious

some of the archetypal symbols whic h have correlates in religion are discussed a circle divided into 
four parts the philosophers stone is a symbol th at seems to recur throughout history four elements 
four colors and quaternity of gods co rrespond to the four parts of the circ le in the western tradition the 
fourth part of these systems is earth blue and ma ry respectively the fourth part is slow in being 
accepted as it is part of the eternal duality of h eaven and hell air and earth male and female it is 
symbolized in dreams by the anim a that part of the unconsci ous suppressed by the male the 
unconscious and the conscious striving for unity are symbolized by the mandala and the squaring of the 
circle collective symbols found in dreams in modern times no deity is observed to be symbolized in 
the center but there is some repres entation of the center as the self a self that has merged conscious 
and and unconscious has come to te rms with its shadow it is thr ough knowing the dark side of of 
psyche the shadow  that we find salvation for the repressed or  suppressed shadow fights to the 
surface in even more frightening forms gods are not  created they are taken on there is no freedom of 
choice if one has an unconscious desire it is really the desire that possesses him part of accepting ones 
psyche as ones self is realizing what is there and reconciling it with ones consciousness there is the 
symbolic circle holding together th e four parts of the stone or the re alization of the wholeness of man 
these symbols of wholeness and unity recur throughout history in dreams and other psychic 
manifestations seemingly without th e influence of tradition or knowledge  of religion of any type such a 
continuity can only exist if one assumes certain unconscious thought forms or archetypes to be an 
inherited a priori process accordingly an archetype is a structural quality or condition peculiar to the 
psyche but somehow connected with the brain the ma ndala symbolizes belief and neurosis a lack of 
faith the choice between mandala and neurosis is deeply personal and subjective but the continual 
choice of the mandala throu ghout history is seen as an objective fact  references

it is contended that in a psychological study of chri stian symbolism which i nvolves a dissection of the 
dogma of the trinity neither the validity nor the sacr edness of the symbols ex amined is in question 
they are studied in terms of their psychic function this study far from degrading the value of these 
symbols is considered to be a confirmation of thei r essential nature as part of the human psyche

primitive prechristian antecedents to the trinit y are explored there have been many primitive 
symbolic triads one of the most important being the babylonian triad of anu bel and ea anu was the 
lord of heaven bel was the lord of the lower realm  earth and ea was the god of the lower realm of the 
watery depths in most of these pr imitive triads there were some fa mily relationships mostly fatherson 
although there were ot hers another theme involves one member of the triad being part man and part

the mathematical speculations of  the greek philosophers are discus sed as important prechristian 
antecedents of the number symbolism of the trinit y one is the number from which all others have 
sprung and is perfect being neither male or female odd or even tw o or the other as it is called in 
some languages divided the qualities into good and ba d male and female heaven and hell both one 
and two are necessary beca use as a single element one would be shapeless and two nonexistent on the 
second day of creation evil was made making two a sinister number the number three is the first 
uneven number and is a masculine number three defines form whereas tw o only designates a two 
dimensional plane the three points are combined into an equilateral triangle to symbolize the trinity 
the number four is left out of gr eek number symbolism and denied because it is a female number and 
is not well understood plato tried to explain the creation in terms of mixing the di visible and the 
indivisible and in terms of the mixing of the same wi th the different it is the combination of these two 
pairs that gives us the combination mean and the third form the description of this combination

the archetypal model for the trinity father son and holy spirit is  discussed as it ma nifests itself in 
greek philosophy the three persons conceived by plato are noted to be related by opposition while the 
christian trinity is based on unity it is concluded that the christian symbol did not derive from the 
greek but rather that both were derived and conceptu alized from more ancient archetypal elements the 
relationship of the holy ghost in the trinity that of  a life force proceeding fr om both father and son is 
observed to resemble egyptian kingship theology more  than greek in both these symbolic systems the 
feminine element is excluded the figure of the son as the revealed god is seen also in the persian 
symbol of gayornart the original man and later in  the gnostic redeemer figures but the archetypes 
actual origin is unknown prehistorical the other figur es in the trinity are considered to have the same 
eternal nature it is noted that only recently has christianity beco me aware of and accepted to some 
extent the similarities of their dogma with the dogma and ritual of other cults

the unfolding of the archetype of the trinity in christian dogma is examined and the various textual 
formulations of the trinit y relationship are mentioned as successive  attempts to give rational symbolic 
expression to a primordial archetype  the first attempt to summarize these preconscious beliefs is the 
apostles creed in it the trinity is latent and it s members are interchangeable in name and function

according to the archetype hypothesi s which states that some tendencies of mind predate the conscious 
development of man all religious theory and cr eed surrounding the trinity has grown up around the 
archetypal idea of a triad the statem ent that dogmas are inspired by the holy ghost indicates that they 
are not the product of conscious  cogitation and speculation but are engendered by sources outside 
consciousness and possibly even outside man the hi story of the trinity is seen as the gradual 
crystallization of one of these archetypes

end a symbolically significant manner of death a wide  range of consequences of his death the symbol 
of self and the god image are indi stinguishable the self is thus s ynonymous with the inner christ it is 
the god within the psychic totality of the individual  anything man postulates as being a greater totality 
than himself becomes a symbol of the self the christ figure itself is incomplete because it lacks evil a 
necessary part of nature it is th rough a blending of good and evil th at selfrealization is reached the

princeton university press   p p   
the holy ghost holds a unique position in the trinity in that it is his function to propagate faith in man 
it is through this faith engendering function simila r to the life engendering relationship between the 
father and the son that we are children of god the ho ly ghost did not arise from  the natural situation 
rather he is a product of human reflection added on to  the natural sequence of fa ther and son to try to 
understand the holy ghost as a feminine archetype w ould be to ignore the qualities of a life common to 
the father and the son and the holy ghosts role of procreating in man and bri nging forth the works of 
the divine parentage the forces that motivate tr initarian thinking are impe rsonal arising from the 
collective psyche they express an un conscious far surpassing all personal needs  that of the integration 
of the unconscious with the conscious  which makes man a psychic whole  
 a ps ycholo gical approach to the do gma of the trinit y  the problem of the fourth  the 
concept of quaternity  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol it nd ed princeton 
university press   p p   
the power of the dogma of the trinity is readily acknowledged but there seems to be a part that is 
missing it is the fourth function of the conscious psyche the feeli ng function that does not cooperate 
the other three thinking sensatio n and intuition follow rational thought  but the fourth feeling is a 
regressive state allied with the unconscious it can be suppressed but only at the expense of the 
conscious function from this archet ypal structure come other natural quaternities into which the world 
seems to be divided according to various philosophies others are the four elements four prime 
qualities four colors four castes etc already in the trinity there are three parts to the quaternity 
father son and holy ghost the fourth part must be the devil or lucifer sin ce in the basic duality of 
the structure of nature good must ha ve evil to have substance the relationship among the elements of 
the trinity and the fourth element is explored it is fr om the father that satan sprang for he is called the 
first son  and christ the second son this places ch rist who stands for all that is good in opposition to 
satan who is evil christ cannot overcome satan on hi s own instead he requires the ministrations of the 
holy ghost a reconciliation of opposites and hence the answer to the human suffering that christ 
persomfies in the diagram of the quaternity mans salv ation is shown in the form of the cross itself a 
quaternity it is contended that there can be no su ch thing as beyond good and evil that the notion 
only encourages selfdeification and that what is n eeded to reconcile the tw o is the holy and unifying 
spirit and comfort of the holy ghost  reference

the psychology of the quaternity  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  nd ed 
princeton university press   p p   
to interpret the trinity symbol psychologically it is c onsidered important to begi n at the individual level 
and to regard the symbol as an expression of the psyc he it is possible to do this because the collective 
ideas represented in religious dogma are derived from the individual consciousness the father 
represents the early state of development of consci ousness this consciousness is a passive unreflecting 
state of awareness without any intellectual or mo ral judgment in a second transformation the son 
usurps the fathers role by forming a violent identification with the fa ther and by subsequently killing 
the father this is not in itself an advancement but  it does force the isolated individual to discriminate 
and reflect rather than to simply  act out of necessity or ignoranc e the third transformation is the 
recognition of the unconscious and subordination to it through the union of psychic opposites with no 
personal designation

the fourth element of the archetype of unity a nd redemption missing in the christian concept of 
trinity is characterized as the el ement of oppositon which alone can give the triad reality no other 
formulation will satisfy the needs of  the unconscious this then is the function of all symbols they are 
allegorical representations of the unconscious pr ocesses accepted universally because they are 
recognized by the unconscious the quaternity symbol as one of these archetypal manifestations is seen 
to occur in dreams as well as the consciously cons tructed dogmas and rituals some typical appearances 
of four figures in dreams are review ed since the unity of the four is  completion of the religious and 
psychic experience the imago dei aspect of the quaternity may be identified with the self the 
implications of these archetypal sym bol structures for the psychotherapist  are considered it is felt that 
neurotic dissociations cannot be re paired by intellectual or purely pr actical methods but rather by the 
integration of symbolic dream images  into the patients consciousness  
 a psychological approach to the d ogma of the trinity  conclusion  in jung c collected 
works of c g jung vol  nd ed princet on university press   p p   
the trinity expresses mans need for spiritual devel opment and independent thinking but this is not the 
only activity of the psyche it is through the essential unity of the three part process father son and 
holy ghost that unconscious maturation occurs in the form of instinctive psychic and regularly timed 
occurrences the symbolic expression of the trinity is seen as a conti  nuing c onscious realization that 
has occurred over the centuries the three forms of g od differ in that the son proceeds from the father 
and the holy ghost comes from both the father and th e son the son is understood as the symbol of self 
and the holy ghost as the selfs actualization in ma n where man enters in unity  with the substance of 
god a fourth and largely ignored symbol is the fi rst son or the fallen a ngel he is eternal and 
autonomous he is the antichn  st it is the oppositon between the trinity and the first son that makes a 
whole this symbol is the realization of evil that completes the self individuation requires the 
realization of the shadow as a part of ones personali ty and the integration of it into ones consciousness 
religion is the revealed or dogmatic way to indi viduation it is a formalization of preconscious 
knowledge valid for the unconscious even if our intellect does not grasp it  reference

idea is thysia from the word to slaughter or sacrific e means the flaring of the sacrificial fire when the 
gift offered to the gods is consum ed the second is deipnon mearting a meal at which sacrificial food is 
eaten hebrews  is also considered a possi ble source for the mass in it are the ideas of 
perpetual sacrifice and eternal prie sthood both essential in the mass ho wever it is th e transformation

the shaving of the head is associated with a return  to the newborn state a rebirth into purity throughout 
the vision it is observed that sacrificer and sacrificed  are identical this unity is  one of the basic themes

the psychological and the metaphysical  or religious interpretations of the roman mass are discussed 
and compared it is the view of the church that  human consciousness represented by the priest and 
congregation is confronted in the mass with an aut onomous force that transcends and transforms it the 
psychological view of the mass as the psyches sym bolic selftransformation through an actingout of 
unconscious drives on the conscious level is seen as complementary rather than contradictory to 
christian dogma the mystery of transubstantiation is  considered no less miracu lous for being human as

through the sacrifice in the mass chri st is eternally redeemed and ma n can reach salvation in the mass 
the sacrifical offering is bread a nd wine symbolizing male and female  spiritual and earthly elements 
as the raw substances of grain and grapes are tran sformed by special processes into bread and wine so 
too are the participants in the mass refined and tran sformed by its ritual it is in identifying a persons 
property as a projection of himself that  the giving of a gift a sacrifice  is giving of part of that person 
thus in sacrificing an object one sacrifices oneself  this act of giving part of oneself reflects the 
knowledge that one does have some control and unde rstanding of the self thus by giving up the self 
one comes to trul y possess it man is forced to make this effort of sacrificin g himself b y the power of the 
unconscious which constantly drives for union with the conscious it is through selfawareness self

totality and finality in the hymn that accompanies th e dance the dual nature of christ is revealed in a

counterpart of the mandala symbolizi ng the division of the world into a polarity of right and left the 
cross is one of the prime symbols of order where opposing sides meet and a third force is found this 
force has the nature of both of the opposing sides but  is itself free of opposition in like manner the 
unconscious contains both th e nature of unity and multiplicity at once without the psyche man could not 
establish the existence of the world let alone know it  it is through selfhood that man finds relief from 
the chaotic conditions in the world the tremendou s polarities in man can only be overcome by the 
terrifying psychic process of understanding the uncons cious an act whereof man is the object and the

need for cooperation and understanding between the two approaches that an idea is not liked and that 
its implications falsify some basic idea underlying so ciety is not considered to negate the idea nor

although werblowskys lucifer and prometheus is pr imarily a work of literary criticism this 
introduction to it examines the poetic reli gious and artistic si gnificance of the satan ima ge and traces 
the numerous changes in the interpretations of this symbolic figure satan first emerged as the shadow 
the symbol of the opposite of good the catholic chur ch made him the left ha nd of god and the first 
son in medieval times the cathars be lieved satan to be the creator of all things and in modern times he 
is seen as a personification of all that is evil it is  a psychological rule that when an archetype such as 
satan has lost its metaphysical hypostasis it becomes operative in the conscious mind of the individual 
as it still contains some numinosity it generally pr oduces an inflation of the subject leading to moral 
irresponsibility

klaus a lth century swiss hermit renounced his famil y and withdrew into solit ude as a result of the

indications of an irrupti ng illumination a primordial religious e xperience of god that can neither be 
assimilated nor denied the whirl symbol used by brot her klaus to elucidate his vision is interpreted as

a brief overview of the development of theories of  neurosis is provided and the relationship between 
psychotherapeutic treatment and mans spiritual suff ering is examined freudi an adlerian and purely 
neurological theories of neurosis are rejected in  favor of the view that  psychoneurosis must be 
understood as the suffering of a soul that has not yet discovered its meaning by defining neurosis in 
these terms the religious nature of the problem b ecomes apparent the inability of the clergy to deal 
with the psychological dimensions of the suffering person is analyzed as in  modem mans unwillingness 
to seek help from the clergy thus it is the doctor  who is confronted with the questions concerning 
ultimate meaning questions formerly  answered by theologians and philosophers in order to liberate the 
sufferer from the interior conflict he is experiencing the doctor is urge d to recognize that he is dealing 
with the fundamental problem of good and evil to d eal effectively with this  problem certain basic 
attitudes are require d unprejudiced objectivity a willingness to  allow the patient to experience his 
capacity for evil a recognition of his own shadows on the part of the doctor healing is defined as a 
reconciliation of the conflicting forces and the pati ents egoism a symptom of neurosis is viewed as 
useful in allowing the neur otic to experience his ow n loneliness and isolation when the archetypes of 
the unconscious are awakened and take over the guidan ce of the psychic personality replacing the futile 
striving and will of the ego the cure begins in reli gious terms the patient ma y describe the experience 
as guidance from god in psychothe rapeutic language it may be described as the psyches awakening to 
its own spontaneous activity it is c oncluded that the cure involves a tr ue primordial experience of the

 psychoanalysis and the cure of souls  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol

the approaches to the cure of s ouls employed by catholic and protes tant clergy are examined and and 
compared to the work of the psychoanalyst it is th e job of the psychoanalyst to lay bare the unconscious 
and integrate it with the conscious mind while the clergymans cure  is based on the christian confession 
of faith the methods of adler and freud are anal yzed in the li ght of their usefulness in the pastoral cure 
of souls and rejected as inadequate rather than to treat the conscious mind freudian psychoanalysis 
seeks to lead the contents of the unconscious over into the conscious mind whereas adlerian 
pedagogics are seen to aim at th e normalization and ad aptation of the individual neglecting the 
unconscious the advantages of the catholic c onfession as a means of understanding unconscious 
control are pointed out the protesta nt minister not having the confessi onal has turned to analytical 
psychology the cure of souls through the soul of the minister working on the soul of the troubled 
person objections to this analytical method are ra ised much faster than to the confessional method 
because the former is more formalized and dogmatic  further the protestant minister who lacks the 
ritual forms for channelling clients psychic conflict s runs a greater risk of  personal involvement in 
these conflicts to the detriment of his professional and family situat ion however the intimate contact 
with the world this curing of souls provides is seen as a challenge and an adventure as well as a danger 
for the protestant minister

the physical as the only criterion of truth is compar ed with psychic truths that which we consider 
real in physical terms ignores th e half of the world that is ps ychically real the archetypes found 
throughout history are part of our unconscious and are unknowable in a physical sense rather they are 
founded in psychic fact these psychic facts are not  constructed by deduction instead they enter the

 answer to job  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  nd ed princeton

the representation of the god yahweh in the book of  job is examined in terms of the amorality of 
yahwehs dealings with humanity in this text yahweh  appears as much more human than divine he is 
unjust selfish irrational and capable of much less mo ral consciousness than job the fact that job asks 
god to defend against god himself is taken as a sy mbol of the dual nature of god as protector and 
persecutor as good and evil simultaneously the char acter of god is clearly an antinomy a unity of 
opposites and it is from this inne r conflict that the dynamism the omniscience and the omnipotence of 
god are seen to derive this view of god is seen as a reflection of the real ization on the part of the 
author of the book of job in particular and of metaphys ical theorists in general that the concept of god 
is a relative one dependent not upon facts but upon inte rpretations however this suspicion did not lead 
to the devaluation of the god figure until the m odern age when the dual nature of god and its 
implication for the mind of man is being seriously an alyzed the state of reli gious thought and tradition 
at the time of the writing of the b ook of job is examined in terms of  the dual nature of god the figure 
of sophia a feminine force coeterna l with god is seen as a derivation of greek symbolic tradition and a 
parallel of indian mythology she is  the gentle and wise counterpart to the ruthlessness of yahweh the 
assimilation of so phia and yahweh is observed to take place at the moment when mans rationalit y and 
sense of justice had matured beyond the point of accepting an unjust god a further humanization of 
god is his coming to earth in the form of man pr efigured in the cain and abel story where the one 
pleasing to gods eye is slain th e son of god is seen as a quality desired by both man and god the 
inclusion of the feminine with the masculine as a part of the concept of god unites conflicting entities a 
similar unification is seen in the awareness of the unconscious by the conscious through symbols it is 
through an analysis of his unconsci ous that man becomes aware of the god archetype god is not 
identified with the unconscious ra ther it is an archetypal image th at arises from the unconscious and 
aids in mans search for wholeness  references

meaning he then looks outward to christianity fo r meaning and purpose the psyche is considered by 
modem man as an untrustworthy part of the mind that  must be suppressed as completely as possible 
partial expressions of his incompletely suppressed psyche are perceived by th e ego centered western 
man as sinful eastern man finds his religion in his subjectivity he looks in ward and becomes totally 
aware of his unconscious and thus of his successe s and failings in so doing the conscious becomes 
identical with the unconscious and every unconsci ous thought can be controlled both eastern and 
western religions fail by refusing to take the others facts as eviden ce psychic events which are not

the parallels between eastern me taphysical thought and the disc overies of modem psychology the 
universal mind of tibetan lore and the collective uncons cious are seen as the same they are the root of 
the experience of validity oneness the interrelation of all archetypes and the validity of the phenomenal 
world here gods exist as thought forms as the one  and the opposite yin and yang by exploring the 
unconscious man finds oneness indefiniteness a nd timelessness knowledge of the one mind is 
necessary in order to know ones self and to compen sate for a onesided adjustment to the world man 
cannot compel unconscious compensation for his onesi dedness instead he must wait for it with a 
comtemplative attitude that is in itself healing the transcendental atone ment is attained by 
withdrawing into the undi fferentiated unconscious wh ere nothing is distinct enough to cause conflict it 
is felt that western man must ca refully explore his unconscious befo re attempting to experience the 
subjectivity of eastern religions it will do him little good to attempt yoga if he is unconsciously a

guided through the  days transition the instant of death is the highest  most glorious moment it is 
from this point that the soul descends until it reach es physical rebirth  days later at the moment of 
death one is part of the mind of buddha this state is called chikhai of which a major symbol is the 
mandala with buddha in the middle the second stat e is the chonyid or the bardo of the experiencing 
of reality it is in this state that man finds out wh at is good and evil precious and worthless subject and 
object and that the ego is sacrificed and the soul ente rs a form of psychosis and torment the third state 
is sidpa or the bardo of seeking rebirth in this state sexual fantasies occur and the soul is drawn 
toward mating couples until it focuses on one and is dr awn toward rebirth in that  couple it is possible

man divested yoga of its religious implications making it just another system to be followed  for 
physical rather than psychic hygiene western man do es not have the same history as eastern man and 
the implications of these differing histories have not carried  over in the use of yoga in that western man

long before buddha who merely followed the path of  meditation certain medita tions are listed through

second object of meditation is water  the symbol of life knowledge a nd grace the water solidifies and 
becomes ice and then lapis lazuli the stone then  becomes transparent and visible under which the 
buddha is sitting on a lotus with the eight demarcatio ns of direction around him it is at the point of 
solidification that western man cannot follow the sym bolism any longer it is here that the unconscious 
becomes real and concrete and mo re importantly known by the consci ous western man finds his peace 
in rising above the unconscious while eastern man de lves into the unconscious to find enlightenment 
western man cannot reach beyond his personal unconscious to th e collective unconscious and his

the thought of the indian holy man sh ri romana and rama krishna is examined as an expression of 
the conflict between ego and self the indian probl em of self and ego parallels the western mans 
godman dichotomy the indian pr oblem appears merely psychological in comparison to the western 
metaphysical problem yet the goal of bot h is to shift the center of being from the ego or man to the self 
or god for the indian this is accomplished by subm erging the ego in the self and for western man the 
submerging of his self in god th e goal of psychic deve lopment is for the self to encompass the 
conscious and unconscious a goal attain able in indian culture but this idea is seen to be threatened in 
india because of the westernization that comes with statehood it is fe lt that western mans ways of

in the foreword to the english edition of the ic hing book of changes a demonstration of how the 
iching functions in the chinese mind is presente d instead of a psychological commentary on the whole 
book the goal of this demons tration is to help the reader to fo rm a tentative judgment on the operation 
of the iching in order to understand the use of the iching it is considered important to distinguish 
between the chinese synchronistic approach to ev ents and the western causal approach the former 
interprets events in terms of coincidence and ch ance consequently the  hexagrams of the iching 
indicate the essential situation that prevailed at the moment of the origin of each hexagram these 
hexagrams in turn are the instruments by which  di fferent yet typical situat ions can be determined 
two experiments are descri bed which illustrate the workings of the iching the book was personified 
ieconsidered as a speaking subject and certain quest ions were addressed to it in keeping with chinese 
tradition  three coins were tossed and the pattern that they formed was used as a guide to the hexameters 
to be consulted an analysis of the hexameters is  provided and the methods used in interpreting their 
significance are discussed with a ttention given to the importance of  lines designated by the numbers  
and  it is concluded from this experiment that the iching as if speaking for itself faced its future on 
the american book market calmly and optimisticall y a second experiment  is described that 
demonstrates how the iching can elucidate the s ubjective attitude of th e user although it is 
acknowledged that the western mind has great diff iculty in accepting the psychological phenomcnology 
of the iching the discussions and prophecies of this work are felt to have a wisdom and knowledge that 
can be attributed to more than chance
