my intention in proposing the two latin words mundus imaginalis as a title for this paper was 
to circumscribe a very precise order of reality which corresponds to a precise mode of 
perception latin terminology has the advantage of providing us with a fixed and technical 
point of reference against which we can compare and measure the various more or less 
vague equivalents suggested by modern western languages 

to begin with i shall make a confession the choice of the two words had begun to become 
inevitable for me some time ago because i found it impossible to content myself with the 
word imaginary for what i had to translate or to describe this is by no means intended as a 
criticism of those whom language usage compels to have recourse to this word since all of 
us are trying merely to revalue it in the positive sense however despite all our efforts we 
cannot prevent that in current and nonpremeditated usage the term imaginary is equated 
with the unreal with something that is outside the framework of being and existing in brief 
with something utopian the reason why i absolutely had to find another expression was 
that for a good many years my calling and my profession required me to interpret arabic 
and persian texts whose meaning i would undoubtedly have betrayed had i simply 
contented myself  even by taking all due precaution  with the term imaginary i had to 
find a new expression to avoid misleading the western reader who on the contrary has to 
be roused from his old engrained way of thinking in order to awaken him to another order 
of things 



 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
in other words if in french and in english usage we equate the imaginary with the unreal 
the utopian this is undoubtedly symptomatic of something that contrasts with an order of 
reality which i call the mundus imaginalis and which the theosophers of islam designate as the 
eighth clime after a brief outline of this order of reality we shall study the organ which 
perceives it ie imaginative consciousness cognitive imagination and finally we shall draw 
some conclusions from the experiences of those who have really been there 

 nkojabd or the eighth clime 

i just mentioned the word utopian strangely enough  or perhaps it is the poignant example 
 in persian our authors use a term that seems to be its linguistic transfer nkojabd 
the country of nonwhere and yet this place is anything but a utopia 

let us look at the very beautiful narratives which are both visionary tales and tales of 
spiritual initiation written in persian by sohrawardi the young sheikh who was the 
resurrector of ancient persian theosophy in the islamic iran of the twelfth century at the 
beginning of each narrative the visionary finds himself in the presence of a supernatural 
being of great beauty whom he asks who he is and whence he comes essentially these tales 
illustrate the gnostics experience lived as the personal history of the stranger the captive 
aspiring to return home 

at the beginning of the narrative which sohrawardi entitles the crimson archangel  the 
captive who has just escaped the watchful eyes of his gaolers ie who has momentarily left 
the world of sensible experience finds himself in the desert in the presence of a being who 
appears to him to be endowed with all the graces of adolescence he therefore asks him 
whence do you come oh youth and the answer is how so i am the eldest child of the 
creator in gnostic terms the protokistos the firstcreated and you call me a youth his 
origin gives the clue to the mysterious purplered colour in which he appears it is the colour 
of a being that is pure light whose brilliance is attenuated to a twilight purple by the 
darkness of the world of earthly creatures i come from beyond mount qf  this is where 
you were at the beginning and it is where you will return once you are free of your 
shackles 

mount qf is the cosmic mountain which summit after summit and valley after valley is 
built up of celestial spheres all enveloping one another where then is the road that leads 
out of it what is the distance however far you may journey it is said you will always 
come back to the point of departure just as the needle of the compass always swerves back 
to the magnetic point does this simply mean that you leave yourself to come back to 
yourself not quite because in the meantime a very important event will have changed 
everything the self one finds yonder beyond mount qf is a higher self the self 
experienced as a thou like khezr or khadir the mysterious prophet the eternal 
wanderer elijah or his double the traveller has to bathe in the spring of life 

 cf the authors french translation of this little treatise written in persian by sohrawardi in en islam iranien 
aspects spirituels et philosophiques vol ii book ii sohrawardi et les platoniciens de perse paris gallimard 
 for a more complete study of the topics dealt with here cf ibid particularly vol iv book vii on the 
th imam or the imam cache 



 
 
 
 
 
                                                 
 
 
he who has discovered the meaning of true reality has arrived at this spring when he 
emerges from the spring he is endowed with a gift that likens him to the balsam of 
which a drop distilled in the hollow of ones hand held up against the sun transpasses 
to the back of the hand if you are khezr you too can pass beyond mount qf without 
difficulty 

the expression nkojabd is a strange term it is not listed in any persian dictionary 
and as far as i know it was forged by sohrawardi himself by using purely persian roots 
literally it means the city the land abd of nonwhere nkoj this is why we are 
confronted here with a term that at first sight may seem to us to be the exact equivalent of 
the term outopia which in turn is not listed in any of the classical greek dictionaries and was 
created by thomas more as an abstract concept to denote the absence of any localization of 
any given situs in the kind of space that can be explored and controlled by our sense 
experience etymologically and literally it might be correct to translate nkojabd by 
outopia or utopia and yet i believe that this would be a misinterpretation of the concept the 
intention behind it as well as its meaning in terms of lived experience it therefore seems to 
me exceedingly important at least to try to find out why it would be a mistranslation 

i believe it is indispensible here to be clear in our minds as to the real meaning and impact of 
the mass of information about the topographies explored in a visionary state ie the 
intermediary state between waking and sleeping including the information that for the 
spiritualists of shiite islam concerns the country of the hidden imam in alerting us to a 
differential that relates to an entire area of the soul and hence to an entire spiritual culture 
this clarification would lead us to ask under what circumstances does what we currently call 
a utopia and therefore the type of man called utopist become possible how and why does 
he make his appearance i am in fact asking myself whether anything like it can be found in 
traditional islamic thought i do not believe for example that the descriptions of the 
perfect city by farabi in the tenth century or along the same lines the rule of the 
solitary by the andalusian philosopher ibn bajja avempace in the twelfth century were 
projections of what we call today a social or political utopia to understand these descriptions 
as utopias we would i fear have to abstract them from their own premises and 
perspectives imposing our own dimensions instead above all however i fear that we 
would have to be resigned to a confusion of the spiritual city with an imaginary city 
the word nkojabd does not denote something that is shaped like a point not having 
extension in space in fact the persian word abd stands for a city a cultivated region that is 
inhabited and consequently an expanse what sohrawardi therefore describes as being 
located beyond mount qf is what all the mystical cities such as jbalq jbars and 
hrqaly represent for him and through him for the entire theosophist tradition of islam it 
is made quite clear that topographically this region starts at the convex surface of the ninth 
sphere the sphere of spheres or the sphere that envelops the cosmos as a whole this 
means it begins at the very moment one leaves the supreme sphere which defines all the 
types of orientation possible in our world or on our side of the world the sphere to 
which the cardinal points refer it becomes obvious that once this border has been crossed 
the question where ubi koj becomes meaningless at least in terms of the meaning it has 

 cf henry corbin histoire de let philosophic islamique vol i paris gallimard  pp  ff  ff 



 
 
                                                 
 
 
in the realm of sensible experience hence we find the expression nkojabd which is a 
place out of space a place that is not contained in any other place in a topos making it 
possible to give an answer to the question where by a gesture of the hand what precisely 
do we mean however when we talk of leaving the where 

undoubtedly what is involved is not a movement from one locality to another a bodily 
transfer from one place to another as would occur in the case of places in the same 
homogenous space as suggested at the end of sohrawardis tale by the symbol of the drop 
of balsam in the hollow of the hand held up to the sun it is essential to go inward to 
penetrate to the interior yet having reached the interior one finds oneself paradoxically on 
the outside or in the language of our authors on the convex surface of the ninth sphere in 
other words beyond mount qf essentially the relationship involved is that of the outer 
the visible the exoteric in greek ta exo in arabic zahir to the inner the invisible the 
esoteric in greek ta eso in arabic batin or the relationship of the natural to the spiritual 
world leaving the where the ubi category is equivalent to leaving the outer or natural 
appearances that cloak the hidden inner realities just as the almond is concealed in its shell 
for the stranger the gnostic this step represents a return home or at least a striving in this 
direction  

yet strange as it may seem once the journey is completed the reality which has hitherto 
been an inner and hidden one turns out to envelop surround or contain that which at first 
was outer and visible as a result of internalization one has moved out of external reality 
henceforth spiritual reality envelops surrounds contains socalled material reality spiritual 
reality can therefore not be found in the where the where is in it in other words spiritual 
reality itself is the where of all things it is not located anywhere and it is not covered by 
the question where the ubi category referring to a place in sensible space its place abd 
as compared to the latter is nkoj nonwhere because in relation to what is in sensory 
space its ubi is an ubique everywhere once we have understood this we perhaps 
understand  the most important thing enabling us to follow the topography of visionary 
experiences we may discover the way sens in french both in terms of meaning and in 
terms of direction moreover it may help us to discover what distinguishes the visionary 
experience of spiritualists like sohrawardi and so many others from such pejorative terms in 
our modern vocabulary as figments of the mind or imaginings  to wit utopian 
fantasies 

at this point however we must make a real effort to overcome what one might call western 
mans agnostic reflex since it is responsible for the divorce between thinking and being a 
whole host of recent theories have their tacit origin in this reflex and it is expected to help 
us escape the other realm of reality that confronts us with certain experiences and evidence 
we try to run from this reality even when we are secretly attracted by it as a result we give 
it all sorts of ingenious explanations but discard the only one which would by its very 
existence suggest what this reality is to understand the hint we would in any event have to 
have a cosmology that cannot even be compared with the most outstanding discoveries of 

 therefore the representation of the sphere of spheres is only a schematic indication in peripatetic or 
ptolemean astronomy it continues to be valid even though this astronomy has been given up this means that 
no matter how high you might be able to go by rockets or sputniks you will never have progressed one inch 
toward nkojabd because the threshold will not have been crossed 



 
 
 
                                                 
 
modern science in relation to our physical universe for as long as we are exclusively 
concerned with the physical universe we remain tied to the mode of being on this side of 
mount qf the traditional cosmology of islamic theosophers is characterized by a 
structure consisting of the various universes and intermediate as well as intermediary worlds 
beyond mount qf ie beyond the physical universes it is intelligible only to a mode of 
existence whose act of being is an expression of its presence in these worlds conversely 
owing to this act of being these worlds are present in it what then is the dimension of this 
act of being that is or will be in the course of future palingeneses the place of these universes 
which are outside our natural space and first of all what worlds are these 

there is the physical sensible world encompassing both our terrestial world governed by 
the human souls and the sidereal universe governed by the souls of the spheres the 
sensible world is the world of the phenomenon molk there is also the supersensible world 
of the soul or angel souls the malakt in which the above mentioned mystical cities are 
located and which starts at the convex surface of the ninth sphere and there is the world 
of pure archangelic intelligences each of these three worlds has its organ of perception the 
senses imagination and the intellect corresponding with the triad body soul and mind the 
triads govern the threefold development of man extending from this world to his 
resurrections in the other worlds 

we realize immediately that we are no longer confined to the dilemma of thought and 
extension to the schema of a cosmology and a gnoseology restricted to the empirical world 
and the world of abstract intellect between them there is a world that is both intermediary 
and intermediate described by our authors as the alam almithal the world of the image the 
mundus imaginalis a world that is ontologically as real as the world of the senses and that of 
the intellect this world requires its own faculty of perception namely imaginative power a 
faculty with a cognitive function a noetic value which is as real as that of sense perception or 
intellectual intuition we must be careful not to confuse it with the imagination identified by 
socalled modern man with fantasy and which according to him is nothing but an 
outpour of imaginings this brings us to the heart of the matter and our problem of 
terminology 

what is this intermediary universe ie the one we referred to earlier as the eighth clime 
for all our thinkers the sensible world of space consists of the seven climes belonging to 
traditional geography however there is another clime represented by a world possessing 
extension and dimension figures and colours but these features cannot be perceived by the 
senses in the same manner as if they were the properties of physical bodies no these 
dimensions figures and colours are the object of imaginative perception or of the psycho
spiritual senses this fully objective and real world with equivalents for everything existing 
in the sensible world without being perceptible by the senses is designated as the eighth 
clime the term speaks for itself since it signifies a clime outside all climes a place outside 
all places outside of where nkojabd 

 on this notion of presence cf in particular the authors introduction to molla sadra shirazi le livre des 
penetrations metaphysiques kitab almashair french edition and translation bibliotheque iranienne vol

the terminus technicus in arabic alam almithal might also be translated by mundus archetypus 
provided one is careful to avoid confusion with another expression for the same word 
alam almithal is used in arabic to render the concept of the platonic ideas interpreted by 
sohrawardi in terms of zoroastrian angelology with the only difference that when it is used 
to denote platonic ideas it is almost always accompanied by the very precise qualification 
mothol plural of mithl afltnya nrnya the platonic archetypes of light whenever the 
term is used to describe the world of the eighth clime it refers on the one hand to the 
archetypal images of individual and singular things in this case it refers to the oriental region 
of the eighth clime the city of jbalq where these images subsist preexistent and pre
ordained in relation to the sensible world on the other hand the term also refers to the 
occidental region the city of jbars it is the world or intermediary world where the spirits 
dwell after their sojourn in the natural terrestial world and the world in which the forms of 
our thoughts and desires of our presentiments and of our behaviour and of all works 
accomplished on earth subsist the alam almithal the mundus imaginalis is made up of all 
these manifestations 

to use once more the technical language of our thinkers the alam almithal is also designated 
as the world of images in suspense mothol moallaqa sohrawardi and his school 
understand by this a mode of being corresponding to the realities of this intermediary world 
and which we shall designate as imaginalia this welldefined ontological status is based on 
visionary spiritual experiences which sohrawardi holds to be as fully relevant as the 
observations of hipparchus or ptolemy are considered to be relevant for astronomy of 
course the forms and figures of the mundus imaginalis do not subsist in the same manner as 
the empirical realities of the physical world otherwise anyone would have the right to 
perceive them the authors also noticed that these forms and figures could not subsist in the 
purely intelligible world that they had indeed extension and dimension an immaterial 
materiality compared to the sensible world but that they also had a corporality and spaciality 
of their own in this context i wish to recall the expression spissitudo spiritualis coined by 
henry more the platonist of cambridge it has its exact equivalent in the writings of sadra 
shirazi the persian platonist for the same reason they considered it impossible for one 
mind to be the sole substratum for these forms and figures and the possibility that they 
must be unreal sheer nothingness was also discarded as otherwise we would not be able to 
discern to grade or to evalute them the existence of this intermediary world the mundus 
imaginalis therefore became a metaphysical necessity imagination is the cognitive function 
of this world ontologically it ranks higher than the world of the senses and lower than the 
purely intelligible world it is more immaterial than the former and less immaterial than the 
latter this approach to imagination which had always been of prime importance for our 
mystical theosophers provided them with a basis for demonstrating the validity of dreams 
and of the visionary reports describing and relating events in heaven as well as the validity 
of symbolic rites it offered proof of the reality of the places that occur during intense 
meditation the validity of inspired imaginative visions of cosmogonies and theogonies and

above all of the veracity of the spiritual meaning perceived in the imaginative information 
supplied by prophetic revelations 

in short this is the world of subtle bodies of which it is indispensible to have some 
notion in order to understand that there is a link between pure spirit and material body 
their mode of being is therefore described as being in suspense like that of the image or 
form this mode of being constitutes its own matter and is independent of the substratum 
to which it is immanent as if by accident in other words form or image does not subsist 
in the manner black color subsists through the black body to which it is immanent the 
comparison regularly used by our authors is the mode in which images in suspense appear 
and subsist in a mirror the material substance of the mirror whether metal or mineral is 
not the substance of the image the image could only accidentally be of the same substance 
as the mirror the substance is simply the place of its appearance and thus we are led to a 
general theory about the epiphanic places and forms mazhar plural mazhir which are so 
characteristic of sohrawardis oriental theosophy 

active imagination is the mirror par excellence the epiphanic place for the images of the 
archetypal world this is why the theory of the mundus imaginalis is closely bound up with a 
theory of imaginative cognition and of the imaginative function which is a truly central 
mediating function owing both to the median and the mediating position of the mundus 
imaginalis the imaginative function makes it possible for all the universes to symbolize with 
each other and by way of experiment it enables us to imagine that each substantial reality 
assumes forms that correspond to each respective universe for example jbalq and jbars 
in the subtle world correspond to the elements of the physical world whereas hrqaly 
corresponds to the heavens the cognitive function of imagination provides the foundation 
for a rigorous analogical knowledge permitting us to evade the dilemma of current 
rationalism which gives us only a choice between the two banal dualistic terms of either 
matter or mind ultimately the socialization of conscience is bound to replace the 
matter or mind dilemma by another no less fatal one that of history or myth 

those accustomed to sojourning in the eighth clime the kingdom of subtle bodies the 
spiritual bodies  threshold of the malakt or the world of the soul  would never have 
fallen victim to this dilemma they say that the world of hrqaly begins at the convex 
surface of the supreme sphere this is obviously a symbolic way of pointing out that this 
world is at the limit where the relationship of interiority expressed by the preposition in 
inside of is inverted spiritual bodies or entities are not in any world nor in their world in 
the same manner as a material body is in its place or may be contained in another body on 
the contrary their world is in them hence the theology attributed to aristotle that arabic 
version of the three last enneads by plotinus which avicenna annotated and which all our 
thinkers read and meditated in turn explains that each spiritual entity is in the entire sphere 
of its heaven of course all these entities subsist independently of each other nonetheless 
all exist simultaneously and each is contained in the other it would be completely wrong to 
imagine this other world as undifferentiated and formless there is indeed multiformity but 
the relative positions in spiritual space differ as much from those in the space encompassed 
by the starry skies as the circumstance of existing in a body differs from the fact of being in

the totality of ones heaven for this reason it can be said that behind this world there is 
heaven an earth sea animals plants and celestial men but every being in it is celestial the 
spiritual entities that subsist there are equivalent to human beings but this does not mean 
that they are terrestial 

the most exact formulation of all this in the theosophist tradition of the west can perhaps 
be found in swedenborg one can hardly avoid being struck by the extent to which the 
statements of the great swedish theosophist and visionary coincide with those of 
sohrawardi ibn arabi or sadra shirazi thus swedenborg explains 

although all things in heaven appear in place and in space as they do in the world still 
the angels have no notion or idea of place and space in fact all progressions in the 
spiritual world are effected by changes of the state of the interiors   hence those are 
near each other who are in a similar state and those are far apart whose state is 
dissimilar and spaces in heaven are nothing but external states corresponding to internal 
ones this is the only case that the heavens are distinct from each other   when 
anyone proceeds from one place to another   he arrives sooner when he desires it and 
later when he does not the way itself is lengthened or shortened according to the 
strength of the desire   this i have often witnessed and have wondered at from these 
facts it again is evident that distances and consequently spaces exist with the angels 
altogether according to the states of their interiors and such being the fact that the 
notion and idea of space cannot enter their thoughts although spaces exist with them 
equally as in the world 

this description applies eminently well to the nkojabd and its mysterious cities in 
brief it follows that there is a spiritual place and a corporal place the transfer from one to 
the other is in a way accomplished according to the laws of our homogenous physical space 
by comparison with corporal space spiritual space is a nonwhere and for those who reach 
nkojabd everything happens contrary to the evidence of ordinary consciousness which 
remains oriented within our space for henceforth the where the place is located in the 
soul the corporal substance resides in the spiritual substance the soul surrounds and carries 
the body as a result one cannot say where the spiritual place is located rather than being 
situated it situates it is situating its ubi is an ubique topographical correspondences can of 
course exist between the sensible world and the mundus imaginalis one symbolizing with the 
other however it is not possible to pass from one to the other without a break this is 
pointed out by many reports one starts out but at some point there is a breakdown of the 
geographical coordinates found on our maps only the traveller is not aware of it at that 
moment he realizes it  either with dismay or amazement  only after the event if he did 
notice it he would be able to retrace his steps at will or indicate the way to others however 
he can only describe where he has been he cannot show the road to anyone 

 e swedenborg heaven and its wonders also hell and the intermediate state from things heard and seen 
transl swedenborg society british and foreign london    swedenborg repeatedly insisted 
on this doctrine of space and time eg in his little book de telluribus in mundo nostro solari if this doctrine is 
not taken into account visionary experiences can be countered by arguments that are as facile as they are 
invalid because they confuse spiritual visions of the spiritual world with the fantasies produced by science 
fiction an abyss separates the two notions  



 
 
 
 
                                                 
 
 spiritual imagination 

here we touch on the decisive point for which everything that precedes has prepared us ie 
the organ by means of which the penetration of the mundus imaginalis the journey to the 
eighth clime is accomplished what is this organ capable of producing a movement that 
constitutes a return ab extra ad intra from the outside to the inside a topographical 
inversion it is not the senses or the faculties of the physical organism much less is it pure 
intellect rather it is the intermediary power which has a mediating role par excellence ie 
active imagination but let there be no misunderstanding here what is involved is the organ 
that makes possible a transmutation of inner spiritual states into outer states into vision
events symbolizing with these inner states any progression in spiritual space is 
accomplished by means of this transmutation or better even the transmutation itself is what 
spatializes the space it gives rise to the space that is there as well as to the nearnesses the 
distances and the faroff places  

the first postulate is that this imagination must be a purely spiritual faculty independent of 
the physical organism and therefore able to continue to exist after the latter has disappeared 
sadra shirazi among others insisted on this point on several occasions just as the soul is 
independent of the material physical body as to intellective capacity for the act of receiving 
the intelligibles the soul is also independent as to its imaginative capacity and its imaginative 
activity moreover when it is separated from this world it can continue to avail itself of active 
imagination by means of its own essence and this faculty the soul is therefore capable of 
perceiving concrete things whose existence as actualized in knowledge cognition and in 
imagination constitutes eo ipso the very concrete existential form of these things in other 
words consciousness and its object are ontologically inseparable here  after this separation 
all the souls powers are assembled and concentrated in the sole faculty of active imagination 
because at that time imaginative perception ceases to be scattered across the various 
thresholds of the physical bodys five senses and because it is no longer required for the care 
of the physical body which is exposed to the vicissitudes of the external world imaginative 
perception can finally display its true superiority over sense perception 

sadra shirazi writes all the faculties of the soul then become as if they were one single 
faculty which is the capacity to configurate and typify taswir and tamthil the 
imagination of the soul becomes just like a sensible perception of the supersensible the 
imaginative insight of the soul is like its sensible insight thus its hearing its sense of smell 
its taste and touch all these imaginative senses are just like the corresponding sensible 
faculties but these imaginative senses are attributed to the supersensible whereas in the 
outer world there are five sensible faculties each with its specific organ in the body in 
the inner world they are synthesized into one hiss rnoshtarak 

having equated imagination with the currus subtilis in greek okhma subtle vehicle or body 
of the soul sadra shirazi sets forth in these texts an entire physiology of the subtle body 
and thereby of the body of resurrection and for this reason he accused even avicenna of 
having identified these acts of otherworldly imaginative perception with what happens in 

 cf the authors book en islam iranien cf note  vol iv book v lecole dispahan chapter ii is entirely 
devoted to the writings of molla sadra shirazi cf also the work cited in note  



 
 
 
 
                                                 
 
dreams during life in the hereandnow for sadra shirazi claims even during sleep the 
imaginative power is affected by the organic activities taking place in the physical body a 
great deal more is therefore required for this power to benefit from a maximum of 
perfection and activity freedom and purity otherwise sleep would simply be an awakening 
in the otherworld that is not so however as suggested by a statement attributed at times to 
the prophet and at times to the first imam of the shiites human beings are asleep only 
when they die they awaken 

a second postulate results spiritual imagination is indeed a cognitive power an organ of true 
knowledge imaginative perception and imaginative consciousness have their function and 
their noetic cognitive value within their own world which is  as pointed out earlier  the 
alam almithal the mundus imaginalis the world of the mystical cities such as hrqaly where 
time is reversed and where space being only the outer aspect of an inner state is created at 
will 

imagination is thus solidly placed around the axis of two other cognitive functions its own 
world symbolizes with the worlds to which the two other functions correspond sensible 
cognition and intellective cognition in other words there is a type of control to protect 
imagination from straying and from reckless wastage thus it can assume its rightful 
function and bring about the events related in the visionary narratives of sohrawardi and 
others for the approach to the eighth clime must be made via the imagination this may be 
the reason for the extraordinary soberness of language encountered in persian mystical epics 
ranging from attar to jami and on to nur alishah where the same archetypes are 
constantly amplified and reamplified by new symbols whenever imagination strays and is 
wasted recklessly when it ceases to fulfill its function of perceiving and producing the 
symbols that lead to inner intelligence the mundus imaginalis which is the realm of the 
malakut the world of the soul may be considered to have disappeared in the west this 
decadence may date back to the moment when averroism rejected the avicennian 
cosmology with its intermediary angelic hierarchy of the animae or angeli caelestes these 
angeli caelestes on a lower rung of the hierarchy than that of the angeli intellectuals had in fact 
the privilege of imaginative power in its purest form once the universe of these souls had 
disappeared the imaginative function itself was thrown out of joint and devalued thus one 
can understand the warning issued later by paracelsus who cautioned against any confusion 
of imaginatio vera as the alchemists called it with fantasy that madmans corner stone 

and this is the very reason for which we can no longer avoid the problem of terminology 
why is it that in french and in english we have no current and entirely satisfactory 
expression for the idea of alam almithal i have proposed the latin mundus imaginalis because 
we must avoid any confusion between the object of imaginative or imagining perception on 
the one hand and what we commonly qualify as imaginary on the other for the general 
tendency is to juxtapose the real and the imaginary as if the latter were unreal utopian just 
as it is customary to confuse the symbol with allegory or the exegesis of spiritual meaning with 
allegorical interpretation allegory being harmless is a cover or rather a travesty of 
something that is already known or at least knowable in some other way whereas the

appearance of an image that can be qualified as a symbol is a primordial phenomenon 
urphaenomen its appearance is both unconditional and irreducible and it is something that 
cannot manifest itself in any other way in this world 

neither sohrawardis stories nor those which in the shiite tradition tell of attainment to the 
country of the hidden imam are in the realm of the imaginary the unreal or allegory 
precisely because the eighth clime or country of nonwhere is not what we commonly call a 
utopia as a world beyond the empirical control of our sciences it is a supersensible world it 
is only perceptible by imaginative perception and the events taking place there can be lived 
only by imaginative or imagining consciousness let me again emphasize that what is 
involved is not imagination as we understand it in our presentday language but a vision 
which is imaginatio vera and this imaginatio vera must be recognized as possessing fully noetic 
or cognitive value if we are no longer capable of talking about imagination in terms other 
than la folle du logis it is perhaps that we have forgotten the standards and the rules the 
discipline and the axial arrangement that guarantee the cognitive function of imagination 
which i have sometimes referred to as imaginatrice 

it must be stressed that the world into which these oriental theosophers probed is perfectly 
real its reality is more irrefutable and more coherent than that of the empirical world where 
reality is perceived by the senses upon returning the beholders of this world are perfectly 
aware of having been elsewhere they are not mere schizophrenics this world is hidden 
behind the very act of sense perception and has to be sought underneath its apparent 
objective certainty for this reason we definitely cannot qualify it as being imaginary in the 
current sense of the word ie as unreal or nonexistent just as the latin word origo has 
provided us in french with the derivatives originaire native of original originel primary the 
word imago can give us the term imaginal in addition to the regular derivative imaginary we 
would thus have the imaginal world as an intermediary between the sensible world and the 
intelligible world whenever we come across the arabic term jism mithali to denote the 
subtle body that reaches the eighth clime or the body of resurrection we will thus be 
able to translate it literally by imaginal body but of course not by imaginary body perhaps 
we will have less difficulty situating figures that are neither mythological nor historical 
and perhaps this translation will provide us with the password for the road leading to the 
lost continent 

and to find the courage to travel this road we would have to ask ourselves what our reality 
is the reality for us so that when we leave it we would attain to more than an imaginary 
world or a utopia furthermore we would have to ask what is the reality of these traditional 
oriental thinkers that enables them to reach the eighth clime nkojabd how are they 
able to leave the sensible world without leaving reality or rather how is it that only in so 
doing they attain true reality this presupposes a scale of being with many more degrees 
than our own let us not make any mistake and simply state that our precursors in the west 
conceived imagination too rationalistically and too intellectualistically unless we have access 
to a cosmology structured similarly to that of the traditional oriental philosophers with a 
plurality of universes arranged in ascending order our imagination will remain out of focus and 
its recurrent conjunctions with our will to power will be a neverending source of horrors in 

 this is a current french term for imagination which literally translated means the madwoman of the house

that event we would be confining ourselves to looking for a new discipline of the 
imagination it would however be difficult to find such a new discipline as long as we 
continue to see in it no more than a way of getting a certain distance to what is called reality 
and a way of acting upon reality now this reality we feel is arbitrarily limited as soon as we 
compare it to the reality described by our traditional theosophers and this limitation 
degrades reality itself another expression that is always offered as an excuse for confining 
reality is reverie such as literary reverie for example or to be more uptodate social fantasy 

however one cannot help asking if it was not necessary for the mundus imaginalis to have 
been lost and to have given way to the imaginary whether it was not necessary to secularize 
the imaginal in the form of the imaginary so that the fantastic the horrible the monstrous 
the macabre the miserable and the absurd could come to the fore in contrast the art and 
imaginations of islamic culture in its traditional form are characterized by the hieratic by 
seriousness gravity stylization and significance neither our utopias nor our science 
fiction nor even the sinister omega point succeed in getting outside this world in reaching 
nkojabd those who have known the eighth clime on the other hand did not 
fabricate utopias any more than the ultimate of shiite thought is a social and political 
fantasy it is an eschatology because it is an expectation and as such implies here and now a 
real presence in another world and is evidence of this other world  

cid 

no doubt countless comments could be made on this topic both by traditionalist and non
traditionalist  metaphysicians as well as psychologists however by way of a tentative 
conclusion i should like to confine myself to raising three little questions 

 we are no longer participants in a traditional culture we are living in a scientific 
civilization which is said to have gained mastery even over images it is quite commonplace 
to refer to our present day civilization as the civilization of the image to wit our 
magazines motion pictures and television but one wonders whether  like all 
commonplaces  this one does not also harbor a radical misunderstanding a complete 
misapprehension for instead of the image being raised to the level of the world to which it 
belongs instead of being invested with a symbolic function that would lead to inner meaning 
the image tends to be reduced simply to the level of sensible perception and thus to be 
definitely degraded might one not have to say then that the greater the success of this 
reduction the more people lose their sense of the imaginal and the more they are 
condemned to producing nothing but fiction 

 would all the imagery the scenography of these oriental narrations be possible without 
the initial objective absolutely primary and irreducible fact urphaenomen of archetypal 
images whose origin is irrational and whose irruption into our world is unforeseeable but 
whose postulate cannot be rejected 

 is it not precisely the postulate of the imaginal worlds objectivity which is suggested to 
us or imposed on us by certain figures and certain symbolic emblems hermetists cabalists 
or the mandalas that have magic effect on the mental images so that they acquire objective 
reality 



 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
in order to hint at a possible answer to the question regarding the objective reality of 
supernatural figures and encounters with them i wish to refer to an extraordinary text in 
which villiers de lisleadam speaks of the face of the impenetrable messenger with eyes of 
clay his face can only be perceived by the mind living creatures only experience the 
influence inherent in the archangelic entity the angels he writes exist substantially 
only in the free sublimity of the absolute heavens where reality is one with the ideal they 
externalize themselves only in the ecstasy to which they give rise and which is inherent in 
them 

these last words  the ecstasy which is inherent in them  seem to me to be of prophetic 
lucidity because they have the virtue of shattering even the rock of doubt of paralyzing the 
agnostic reflex in the sense that they break through the mutual isolation of consciousness 
and its object of thought and being here phenomenology becomes ontology undoubtedly 
this is the postulate implied in our authors teaching on the imaginal there is no external 
criterion for the manifestation of the angel other than the manifestation itself the angel is 
the very ekstasis the movement out of ourselves which represents a change in our state of 
being for this reason these words also suggest what the secret of the supernatural being of 
the hidden imam is in the shiite consciousness the imam is the ekstasis of this 
consciousness noone who is not in the same spiritual state can see him 

this is what sohrawardi alluded to in his narrative of the crimson archangel what he meant 
by the sentence we quoted at the beginning if you are khezr you too can pass beyond 
mount qf without difficulty
