through insights gained from the clinical study of  patients two broad personality types are 
distinguished the introverted a nd the extraverted in the introduc tion to psychological types the 
theory is stated the method to be followed to  understand them is described and the definition 
characteristics and effects of these two personality types are summarized for the introverted 
personality subjective and psychologica l processes are the center of in terest all lifegiving energy seeks 
the subject himself the object has a lower value th an the subject the extraverted personality on the 
other hand is drawn to the object as  the center of interest ultimate value rests in the object and the 
subject subordinates his own subject ive processes to the object the psychological result of these two 
standpoints is two totally different orientations one sees everything in terms of the objective event 
extraverted the other sees everything in terms of his own situation int roverted this broad 
classificatiow does not exclude the existence of a se cond set of psychological types determined by the 
four basic psychological functions thinking fee ling sensation and intu ition found within both 
introverted and extraverted persona lities this work then will di scuss both sets of types one 
determined by the predominant center of interest th e other determined by the predominance of one of 
the four basic psychological functions i reference

the psychological types postulated by gnostic phi losophy the types represented by tertullian and 
origen and the relationship of christianity to la ter thought and knowledge are discussed in early 
history one finds a collective atti tude rather than a concept of the individual gnostic philosophy 
postulated three types corresponding to three basic psychological func tions the pneumatikoi related to 
the thinking function the psychikoi related to f eeling and the hylikoi related to sensation in 
gnosticism feeling was devalued in favor of thought in christianity th e reverse was true tertullian the 
fanatic who created church latin is  described as a classic example of  introversion sacrificing intellect 
to the inner soul origen another christian scholar is  classified as a classic extravert by his self
castration he sacrificed feeling and sensation to  intellect or objective  fact  references

examples of the opposition between extraverte d and introverted psychological types the

disputes one set of positions placed  an extreme value on the sensually visible the other valued the 
abstract and extrahuman this type conflict reappe ared in the pelagianaugustinian controversy of the 
fifth century pelagius and celestius defended the rightness of the feeling of human value against au

basic psychological types radbertus doctrine of communion tra nsubstantiation is contrasted with that 
of scotus erigena commemoration as examples of  the opposition between extraverted and introverted 
thinking abbot paschasius radbert us concretized the symbols of br ead and wine by maintaining that 
the wine and bread of communion were transf ormed into the body and blood of christ scotus 
praised by hales in his history of the christian church  as one of the most adva nced thinkers of his day 
maintained that communion was nothing more than a co mmemoration of the last supper of christ with 
his apostles no conclusions are drawn about the individual psychology of the two protagonists but a 
brief description of their lives and their fates is given the effect of the belief in miracles analyzed 
extraverted thinking is qualified as rational introverted as programmatic the fact that radbertus 
extraverted thinking was accepted as doctrinal and scot us introverted thinking rejected as lifeless is 
considered to indicate that the age itself longed for the reality of reli gious miracles a nd that radbertus 
thought was perceived as life giving because it concretized the desire of the age

the definition historical  roots characteristics and signifi cance of nominalism and realism are 
examined the nominalists held that universals such  as beauty goodness animal man etc are nothing 
but names or words the realists maintained that uni versals exist in themselves before the thing ante
rem the roots of the opposition between these two philosophies are traced to the platonic and 
megarian schools gromperz is credited with perceiving the fundamental  opposition in terms of 
inherence and predication using th e progression from our perception of  warm to our recognition of the 
existence of energy as an example the development of the thing likeness of the purely conceptual is 
demonstrated this thinglikeness was apparent in primitive mans perception of the imago as a 
sensory colored memory image or hallucination si nce modem man desensitizes the psychic image and 
thinks abstractly this process can only be recaptured in dreams or mystical vision both these examples 
support the theory that the reality of the predicate is  given a priori since it has always existed in the 
human mind  references

the problem of defining the nature of universals and the relationship between these definitions and god 
concepts is reviewed porphyry de fined the problem as the opposition between the belief that universals 
are substantial corporeal and existing in corporeal things and the belief that they are intellectual 
incorporeal and separate things be tween the platonic view of reality in which the universal idea was 
considered to exist before the thi ng and the nominalist attitude that generic concepts were mere words 
stood aristotles realistic view that form and matt er coexist in the middle ages this controversy 
became the quintessence of scholas ticism roscellinus represented the nominalist view anselm and 
abelard the realistic anselm s ontological proof of the existence of god  that the idea of god proves 
his existence is considered psychologi cally important it is a demonstrati on of the reality of the world of 
ideas psychology must recognize the difference be tween these two approaches since they now 
influence current oppositions between idealism and realism spiritualism and materialism other 
cham pions of the o pposing arguments are discussed and kants position is summarized kants 
mediatory position is accepte d as being as definitive and conclusi ve the god concept is explained in 
terms of analytical psychology the god concept coin cides with a particular ideational complex which 
in accordance with its definition concentrates in it self the maximum amount of libido or psychological

realism c abelards attempt at conciliation  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  nd

the analysis of abelards conceptu alism as an intermediary positi on between nominalism and realism 
leads to the discussion of the role of psychology an d fantasy in establishing a point of conciliation 
between the idea and the object and concludes with an examination of the theories of freud and adler 
from nominalism abelard took the idea that universals are words in that they are intellectual 
conventions expressed by language fr om realism he borrowed the theo ry that genera and species are 
combinations of individua l facts and things by reason of simi larity his position conceptualism 
maintained that individual objects are perceived and classified into genera and species by reason of 
similarities thus reducing the absolute multiplicity of the nominalists into a relative unity abstraction 
and empathy are discussed as the underlying methods of the conceptu alist had psychology existed in 
abelards age his position would have  been that of esse in anima rea lity in the self however his 
conciliation was unsatisfactory and confusing because  he attempted to resolve the differences on the 
level of a logicalintellectual formulation wherea s the problem is a psychological one requiring the 
recognition of concrete reality psyc hology on the other hand in so far as it recognizes that the unity of 
the idea and the thing occurs within the human psyc he arrives at a true c onciliation the process of 
conciliation and the role of fantasy in this proces s are described fantasy is defined as the clearest 
expression of the psyche the creative activity from  which all answers come the sole mechanism which 
unites introversion and extraversion so me of the difficulties that prevent the recognition of the role of 
fantasy are examined the influence of christianity  in suppressing the unconscious in the individual 
thus paralyzing the activity of fantasy is analyzed as is the role of the sciences psychology as an 
abstract science does not escape the tendency to conde mn fantasy it is only in  practical psychology that 
the conciliation in its totality is treated freud vi ewed fantasy as a causal elementary process he 
explained the problems of the psyche  as resulting from the repression of incompatible wish tendencies 
adlers psychology is dominated by the belief in ego s uperiority that never allows man to be subject to 
the object it is concluded that the theory of freud was extraverted th at of adler introverted fantasy is 
seen as the key to the synthesis of the opposing mechanisms  references

the difference between the subject or iented and the object oriented t ypes introverts and extraverts is 
illustrated with an example drawn from a religious controversy the differing beliefs of luther and 
zwingli regarding holy communion luther the object oriented type  believed in the doctrine of 
transubstantiation not because he was unable to let go of tradition but because the actual sense contact 
with the bread and wine and the feel ing value resulting therefrom determ ined his belief zwingli in his 
belief that communion was a symbol wa s faithful to the new evangelism  and the dictates of reason he 
ignored the sense impression and the feeling value de rived from the contact wi th the object and thought 
only of the principle or ideal beneath the object thei r views were mutually exclusive and irreconcilable 
since they sprang from the extraverted luther and introverted zwingli c onceptions of things

schillers letters on the esthetic education of man uber die asth etische erziehung des

separation is examined the ancient worlds emphasis on the development of the few is contrasted with 
christianitys collective culture th e present situation of individual deve lopment is analyzed in relation to 
collective functions schillers recogni tion that certain functions have be en repressed inf erior functions 
and his fear of the conflict that would ensue within the individual once he was liberated is the basis for 
an analysis of the effects of an imperfect ly developed function ope rating unconsciously and 
autonomously on the conscious mind sc hiller overcame his fear of co nfronting the conflict by relating 
his personal struggle to the larger contemporary sc ene as did rousseau both sought the solution in 
earlier historical periods the disadva ntages of the retr ospective orientation is exposed and it is proposed 
that the beginning of a solution resi des in the acceptance of the inferi or functions and the creation of a 
gradient that will allow them to come into play a detailed description of the way in which the inferior 
functions rise to the surface is pr ovided schillers perception of the problem is that of the introvert 
goethes that of the extrovert this judgement is  substantiated by examples drawn from schillers 
definition of god and by a quotation fr om schiller that expresses the c onscious attitude of the introvert

schillers identification of two basic functions fe elingsensation and thinki ng his awareness of their 
opposition and the need for a third function play in stinct to mediate this opposition are discussed 
schillers ideas are examined in the light of the theo ry on the role of fantasy and the symbol in resolving 
the conflict between the two instincts schillers th eories are colored by his own introverted thinking and 
personality type nevertheless it is demonstrated  that schiller was awar e of several psychological 
realities the two basic functions can replace each other identification with one differentiated function 
can occur both sensuality and spirituality have a fight  to exist and symbols arise from the living out of 
both instincts at the same time schiller is also cred ited with the discovery of an individual nucleus in 
which both instincts exist but which is not identified  with either these discov eries of schiller are the 
springboard for descriptions of th e transcendent function of the sy mbol the collab oration of the 
unconscious in fantasy and the methods by which the ba sic instincts can be defu sed schillers  esthetic 
condition is compared to the st ate produced by certain indian pract ices yoga tapas brahmanism rta 
and the like schillers solution is  criticized and his limitations ar e analyzed as reflecting his own 
unconscious ideal schiller is praised for his intu itive grasp of the things he observed and for 
recognizing that the mediatory position produces something positive namely the symbol the 
conclusion emphasizes the importance of  the symbol it unites antithetical elements within its nature

 schillers ideas on the type problem  a discussion of naive and sentimental poetry a 
the naive attitude  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  nd ed princeton university 
press   p p   
schillers definition of the naive poet as he who follows nature  and sensation and who confines himself 
to the mere copying of reality is examined the characteristics of the naive poet as described by 
schiller are listed and analyzed as an example of  a typical mechanism insofar as the naive poets 
relation to the ob ject ex presses an intro jection of the ob ject or an a priori identification based on an 
analogy between the object and the unconscious of the poet the naive poet is conditioned by the object 
the poet in turn tends his expressive function to the obj ect as it represents itself  to him it is concluded 
that the poet described by schiller as  naive is extraverted to the extent  that this process gives the object 
supremacy over the subject

schillers commentary on the naive and sentimental poets is continue d the characteristics of the 
sentimental poet are examined and are shown to be expressive of the introve rted attitude additional 
consideration is given to the functions of sensat ion and intuition in order to further specify the 
introverted and extraverted attitudes  schillers description of the se ntimental poet indicates that an a 
priori separation from the object is the foundation of  the sentimental poets attitude the work that 
results is a product of reflection and abstraction th e dualism of the sentimental poet is discussed as 
stemming from the twofold source of  his creativity the object itself and the poets perception of it in 
that the sentimental poet stands above the object and best ows value or quality on it his attitude is that of 
introversion the introverted and ex traverted attitudes do not exhaust the understanding of the two types 
of poetry however sensation and intuition are cons idered in their relation to the introverted and 
extraverted attitudes a preponderance of sensation characterizing the naive poet a preponderance of 
intuition characterizing the  sent imental poet  reference

the idealist and the realist  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  nd ed princeton 
university press   p p   
the division of the poets into na ive and sentimental types leads sc hiller to the recognition of two 
fundamental psychological types whos e significance in schillers scheme of things corresponds to the 
introverted and extraverted types  by subtracting the cr eative genius from both mechanisms schiller 
arrived at the isolation of two reci procal psychological types the realis t and the idealist the former the 
naive poet depends on the testimony of his senses and is attached to the object which maintains an 
autonomy in the subject the latter the sentimental poet remains det ached from the object depends on 
his speculative powers and uses th e object to arrive at the absolu te schillers observations are 
abandoned at this point since they relate exclusivel y to the familiar phenomena of the realist and idealist 
attitudes  reference

the analysis of niet zsches apollinian and dionysian types as defined in his the birth of tragedy 
leads to a discussion of intuitive and sensation ps ychological types the apollinian type based on an 
inner perception of beauty and producing a psychological state th at nietzsche called dreaming is 
analogous to the mechanism of introversion the dionysi an type is based on a streaming outwards akin 
to goethes diastole or schillers world embraci ng it produces a psychological state that nietzsche 
termed intoxication this streaming outwards is analogous to the extr averted mechanism the 
reconciliation of the two t ypes was perceived by nietzsche to be an  esthetic solution apparent in greek 
tragedy this explanation is rejected and religion is  posited as the source of  the reconciliation the 
esthetic solution however le ads to the identification of sensation and intuitive types these two types 
are defined and a distinction is  made between them and the rati onal thinking feeling types the 
intuitive type raises the unconscious perception of the world to the level of a di fferentiated function the 
sensation t ype relies exclusivel y on sense im pression and is psycholo gically oriented toward instinct 
nietzsche himself is classified as an intuitive lean ing toward introversion and reasons are given for this 
classification  references

the two characterological types proposed by furneaux jordan in character as seen in body and 
parentage are examined and compared to function t ypes jordans typology reveals his intuitive grasp o f 
the introverted and extraverted t ypes although his analysis of function types is confused by the 
introduction of the activity factor ascribing a more impassioned but le ss active nature to the introvert 
and a less impassioned but more active nature to the ex travert jordan is praised for his characterization 
of the types in terms of affectivit y the reflective contemplative natu re of the introvert is compensated 
by the archaic unconscious instinct and sensation th e busy outward seeking nature of the extravert is 
compensated by unconscious archaic thinking and feeli ng thus the introvert is more influenced by his 
passions and the extravert by his inner psychic life jo rdans intuitive analysis is compared to rational 
analysis showing that both arrive at the same conclu sions jordans intermediate group is recognized as 
analogous to sensation and intuitive types  reference

princeton university press   p p   
a psychological portrait of the introverted woman is dr awn from jordans analysis  of her affectivity and 
the description of her conscious inner life and its relation to affectivity jordans view is seen as relying 
too heavily on the introverted womans capacity for de ep hatred love sympathy jealousy intensity and 
capacity for intimacy this limitation is counterbalan ced by the analysis of her contemplative analytical 
logical powers her well ordered in tellectual life is perceived as a defense against an elemental 
confused and ungovernable affective life this view leads to the conclusion that the mind of the 
introverted woman is more to be relie d upon than her untamed affectivity

jordans description of the extraverted or less impassioned woman is given with comments on the 
manner in which thought and affect appear in this type jordan describes th e extraverted woman as 
idealess restless emotionless a nd spotless it is agreed that the tendency toward incoherent and 
inconsequential criticism that jordan ascribes to th is type reveals an absenc e of independent reflection 
however it is felt that jordan undervalues affect in  the extraverted woman in contrast the value of the 
differentiation of affectivit y is emphasized although shallow it is socially oriented thus promoting the 
life of the community and the welfare of society it  is maintained that neither the introverted nor 
extraverted type is the more valuable both are necessa ry to the individual and to society  reference

jordans description of the extraverted or less impa ssioned man is given along with the criticism that 
jordans intellectual approach is an inadequate  method for evaluating the extraverted man jordans 
descri ption of the extravert is felt to be a ca ricature of the concre te man the difficult y that a reflective 
man like jordan encounters in attempting to grasp the value of the lived reciproc al relationship of the 
extravert to the object is explained the reflectiv e man or introvert sees the shadow cast by the 
unconscious of the positive man alt hough the judgment of the unconscious  is correct it neglects the 
conscious man a warning is given to psychologists they must differentiate the conscious man from the 
unconscious in order to arrive at true understand ing and avoid reducing the man to his unconscious 
background  reference

university press   p p   
jordans brief description of the introverted or more  impassioned man is given with an explanation for 
the cause of its inadequacy it is observed that the brevity of jordans  description and the total absence o f 
a description of the passion attribut ed to this type can be explained by positing that jordan himself was 
an introvert and was therefore incapable of percei ving and explaining his own unconscious this leads to 
the conclusion that neither the extrav ert nor the introvert is capable of giving an adequate description of 
his own unconscious nor can one adequately explain the concrete in the other jordans observation on 
the introverts genuine love of pleasure is consid ered important however since it provides a valuable 
insight into the nature of introverted  feeling jordans analyses are aba ndoned at this point because of the 
fallacies derived from the introduction of the activity  factor although jordan is credited with having 
given an appropriate character sketch of  the emotional types  reference

psychological types is discussed and related to the brahman solution the religious solutions of 
spitteler nietzsche schopenhauer and goethe are an alyzed as voicing the wo rkings of the collective 
unconscious the god image is the symbol of the unconscious while the symbol of god renewal is 
intimately connected with the oppos ition of types and functions the renewal of god is a primordial 
universal image of a transf ormation in attitude the psychological poi nt of departure for this symbol is

conscious attitude the brahmanic solution and its me aning are explained the exter nal emotional and 
ideational opposites are denied participa tion in the psyche in order to liberate the self for the new life in

one arrives at this state this irrational union is expressed in the upanishads as libido symbols

this understanding of libido is basic to the un derstandi ng of morality it is stated that there can be no

brahman in the rikiryochi formulation of  the japanese philosopher toju and in the

by showing that it is part of the collective unconscious of all ages an  exteriorization of the lived conflict

as it appears in several religious works litanies  the song of songs the divine comedy faust and the 
shepherd the union of op posites in the works of sp itteler and goethe took the form of worship of 
woman a symbol for worship of the soul this trans ition from woman to soul is illustrated by selections 
from the she pherd of hermas throu gh anal ysis of the visions and revela tions of hermas it becomes 
evident that the libido originally attracted to the wo man in an erotic fashion is detached from the real 
object concentrates on a symbol the tower standing fo r the church and is canalized into a symbol ic 
function  the consolidation of th e christian view of the world the importance of symbol formation is 
derived from the fact that it prevents absolute relation of subject to object or absolute id entity of subject 
with object for should the latter occur all cogniti on would be impossible and a dangerous inferiority in 
affectivity would result the purpose of the sym bol is  stated to free the subject for the possibility of 
choice this is accomplished by drawing the libido away from the ob ject devaluing the object and 
bestowing surplus libido on the subject which li bido works on the unconscious placing the subject 
between an inner and outer determinant the symbols emerge at the stage of withdrawal of libido into 
the uncon scious where certain archaic engrams are found these en grams correspond to inherited 
ways of functioning which owe their existence to the differentiation of instinct  the vessel symbol is 
analyzed as an illustration of how symbols are derived from archaic c onceptions and in the case of the

the concept of the relativity of g od as it appeared in the writings  of the medieval thinker meister 
eckhart is defined and re lated to the historical de velopment of the individual  a concept that reached a 
point of culmination in the reforma  tion this discovery of the relativity of god is considered a major 
landmark for a psychological understanding of religious phenomena this concept of  relativity implies a 
reciprocal relation between god and man wherein man is a functi on of god and god a psychological 
function of man the psychological explanation of this co ncept is given if god is outside the soul as in 
the absolutist view he is projected into objects giving them overpowering influence over the soul the 
subject must detach and internalize the surplus of libido from the object tu rning it into an inner 
possession the bliss fulness which results is an indication of a dynamic relation between unconscious 
and conscious in which the former predominates in  order to understand this  concept of god it is 
necessary to understand the term soul  therefore the soul is defined  the historical evolution of the 
concept of soul is traced and the capacity to mediate between the subject and the unconscious is 
attributed to it in this meeting place god   th e unconscious  is apprehende d and the creative function 
of the soul gives birth to symbols this birth of god is described as a continual process a

acting withdraws from it worringe rs abstraction is found to correspond to the jungian definition of 
introversion and empathy to extraversion the role of  the unconscious influencing these two responses 
is examined it is proposed that the abstracting i ndividual has unconsciously projected his own negative 
feelings into the object and that it  is from these that he consciously  withdraws the empathetic observer 
has first unconsciously neutralized the object in order to make it a suitable receptable for his own 
subjective contents introversi on and extraversion empathy and abstraction are explained as 
mechanisms of defense in this function they can protect man from external dangers when carried to

be reasonable is common to both empiricism and id eologism their opposition stems from the source of

the positive act of evaluation this is evident in th e views of reason held by ka nt and wundt introverted

ideological or introverted thinking as synthetic the opposition of the two types becomes especially 
clear in the conclusion the introvert shapes ps ychic data using his unconscious and arrives at 
experience the extravert is guided by sensory material that in fact reflects his unconscious projections

reconciling the philosophical antagonism between empi ricism and ideologism while recognizing the 
contributions of james typology to  understanding the role of temper ament in philosophical differences 
james typology is a useful but not an absolute cons truct valid only as long as no other factors are 
operative in the formation of philosophical concepts  although james was the first to draw attention to 
the importance of temperament in coloring philos ophical thought he focused primarily on thought and 
gave no attention to the role of intuition the introducti on of intuition and its use in solving the conflicts 
of opposites is seen in the works of bergson niet zsche schopenhauer and hegel further pragmatism 
is considered to obstruct creativeness seen as the only possible source of final resolution of the

robert meyer gauss liebig humphrey davy a nd faraday illustrate the contrasts between the 
romantic and classic types in term s of their ability to communicate their thoughts rather than in the 
speed of reaction the observed slowness of the classi c thinker is due to a tendency to react inwardly

of abstraction withdrawing libido fr om the object the extraverts attitude constantly relates to and is 
oriented by the object as these t ypes are randomly distributed among cu ltures levels of society and

introverted feeling can be inferred only indirectly as it seldom appears on the surface it aims to

is usually a woman silent inaccessi ble and giving an impression of pl easing repose unless the object is 
too strong in such cases the obvious turning of he r feeling away from it would make her appear 
indifferent and cold intemperate passion is taboo for he r although her feelings ar e intensive rather than 
extensive her passions may flow into her childre n but are generally secretive a tendency to coerce 
others with her secret f eeling rarely disturbs the normal introvert  but a trace of domineering is evident 
when the unconscious subject is identified with the ego the individual becomes a despot and ultimately 
neurotic in this type unconsciou s thinking takes the form of ar chaic consciousness that helps 
compensate for the exaltation of the ego however if  the ego assumes the subject projection occurs the 
power of the object is felt and elaborate counterplots are produced by the ego as defenses the neurosis

is extraverted the subjective mode is devalued in western culture and the intr overt comes to devalue it 
in himself to feel inferior and to become more  egotistical thus ultimat ely deserving his general 
censure

the nature of sensation in the introvert and the characteristic normal and ne urotic behavior of the 
introvert sensation t ype are discussed such t ypes dwell predominantl y on the sub jective as pects of 
perception so that the object becomes secondary to the excitation produced by it a subjective 
perception is defined by the meaning associated with  it rather than by the me re image of the object 
represented this meaning is not consciously de veloped but springs from  a primordial psychic 
organization therefore no proportional relation exists  between object and sensation for the introverted 
sensation type and such an indivi dual may seem unpredictable and arbitrary this subjective content to 
perception intervenes and intercepts the effects of the object and in more serious cases a protective 
defense obscures its influence in pa thological cases the type is no longe r able to distinguish between the 
real object and the subjective percep tion the intervention of the unconscious is seen to cause even a 
normal introverted sensation type to act accord ing to an unconscious model and not the real 
environment further his lack of comparative j udgment leaves him unaware of his alienation from 
reality when extreme detachment for the object occurs  intuition is repressed into the unconscious and 
has an extraverted and archaic qua lity producing compulsive ideas of the most perverse kind and 
usually resulting in a compulsion neurosis

introverted intuition is described as directed to the inner object to the archaic contents of the 
unconscious it excludes sensation and perceives the world by filtering sensory information through the 
background processes of consciousness which consist of primordial archetypal images these images 
take on the reality of things for the intuitive introvert  the artist is described as  a typical representative 
of this type ordinarily there is little inclination to extrapolate these images to the world but when there 
is a different type of individual is produced one who attempts to relate himself to his visions and find 
meaning in them while remaining unadapted to ever yday reality the psychologica l danger of this type 
is considered to fie in the extreme suppression of  sensation which gives rise to a compensatory 
extraverted sensation function of archaic character normally this serves to compensate the conscious 
introverted attitude but if it cannot the unconscious becomes ex cessively dependent on the object 
causing a compulsion neurosis with hypochondriacal symptoms

the characteristics of the introvert ed irtational types are described in terms of their inability to 
communicate and in terms of their contribution to so ciety outwardly visible tr aits of these types are 
seen as a general secretiveness lack of sympat hy and uncertainty they are mostly misunderstood and 
lacking in judgment do not understand themselves it  is thus doubly difficult for them to communicate 
intelligibly the richness of the subjective events they experience from a rationalistic extraverted 
viewpoint they are useless to societ y yet they are in a way educat ors and promoters of culture through 
the example of their life rather th an by their production of ideas their li ves are considered to illustrate 
the possibility of a rich and fulf illing interior life an ideal l acking in western civilization

the interrelationships of the func tions of thinking feeling sensation and intuition at the conscious and 
unconscious levels are discus sed the consciousness of an y function is taken to mean that control of the 
will that decisively orients consciousness only one  function can have principa l orienting power unless 
there is no differentiation of any function as in the case of primitive ment ality a second function can 
operate as an auxiliary or comple mentary one if its nature is di fferent from but not opposed to the 
dominant function thus a rational principal function t hinking can have either of  the irrational functions 
sensation or intuition as an auxiliary because th ey are functions of perception not of judging this 
auxiliary function proves useful only inasmuch as it  serves the primary function in addition to the 
primary conscious function aux iliary unconscious functions ar e observed to exist which group 
themselves in patterns correlated with and at t imes opposed to the conscious ones and exist in an 
archaic animal state implications of these f unctions for psychoanalytic treatment are discussed

the paradoxical problem of e xplaining or understanding human psychology by means of human 
psychology is raised the heterogeneity of men is su ch that no one perfect world could be devised for 
all hence the concept of typical attit udes is intended to reflect the hete rogeneity of man and is seen as a 
necessary antidote to theories that  account for the uniformity of man explanations of mans uniformity 
can be discovered in the foundations of the consciou sness his individual differentiation can be found in 
a psychology of types based on the observation that the psychic process is not  merely the object of 
psychology but also its subject it is deemed inevit able that each psychological theory will reflect its 
author thus it is concluded that an intellectual examination of the human psyche must necessarily 
incorporate elements of paradox and relativity  references

the psychological types are reviewed  and their basis in the subdivisi on of attitudes and of functions 
crediting galen with the first attempt to classi fy humans based on affectiv ity is described beyond 
affectivity most persons can be gr ouped in terms of one of two attit udes either they are primarily 
motivated by external impersonal factors or by intern al subjective factors as  the two attitudinal types 
perceive everything differently they are usually inco mpatible in addition to these two attitudes the 
conscious psyche is seen as an a pparatus for adaptation that consists  of four basic psychic functions 
sensation perceptions by means of the sense orga ns thinking drawing conclusions in terms of 
subjective valuation feeling a f unction of subjective valuation a nd intuition perception by means of 
the unconscious although these would ideally balan ce one another perfectly in the individual psyche 
in reality one function usually occupies the foregr ound while the others remain as background each of 
these four functions is linked in some way with the ex traverted or introverted attitude so that no man is 
simply introverted or extraverted except in terms of one dominant function th e unconscious stands in a 
compensatory relation to the conscious and acco mmodates the repressed functions which remain 
undeveloped archaic and are of the opposite attitude from the conscious one conflict is considered to 
occur if a conscious attitude beco mes too onesided at least eight di stinguishable types are found but it 
is acknowledged that more could be established each with greater subtle ty of description  references

the history and logic of the development of a psyc hology of types is presented as growing from the 
study of psychogenic symptoms and fro m the realization that the complexe s were important in that they 
contained conflicts between the demand for adaptati on and the individuals c onstitutional ability to 
respond to that demand the complex alone although it is most basic and oc curs earliest is inadequate to 
explain individual differences in neur otic reactions these differences apparently innate showed certain 
fundamental peculiarities that invited grouping an ac tivepassive grouping prove d unsatisfactory as did 
a reflectiveunreflective grouping a lthough the latter more nearly a pproximated the observations the 
classification of a negative versus a positive reac tion to an object was undertaken with the negative 
called introversion and the positive extraversion this definition still did not account for observed 
differences between individuals a nd a further exploration into the psychic functions was needed to 
explain for example why one introvert hesitates in a certain way and another in a different way 
concepts of thinking and feeling were taken from general speech to represent the rational approaches 
and those of sensation and intuition to represent pe rceptions which are not ev aluative or rational but 
irrational each of the irrational functions sensation and intuition is considered incompatible with the 
other the effect of one functions domination over th e others is observed to be the repression of the 
subordinate functions into the unconscious

a discussion of the psycholo gical t ypology that takes into account individual differences is preceded b y 
a brief history of attempts at psychological classification include d are descriptions of galens 
melancholic sanguine choleric a nd phlegmatic temperaments as forerunners of studies relating 
hormones to temperament and the theories of fl ournoy james and freud which view the psyche as a 
totality through extensive clinical contact with people from  many classes and nations a theory of the 
attributes certain groups had in common was devel oped it became clear that there were two basic 
psychological types which are called extravert and introvert extraversion is characterized by interest in 
the external object responsiveness and a ready acc eptance of external happenings the extravert as a 
subjective entity is seen as hidden from himself and his psychic fife is enacted outside himself in 
accordance with the environment the introvert is directed not to the ob ject but the subject he is aloof 
from external happenings and finds his inner life his foremost pleasure his psychic life is played out 
wholly within these two attitudes are described as  opposing modes for which the numinal accent the 
essential orientation of the type decides between subject and object and selects the conscious function 
of which the individual makes most use four basic psychologi cal functions are postulated thinking 
feeling sensation and intuition of which the first tw o are rational or judging a nd the last two irrational 
or perceiving as sensation and intu ition rule each other out so that  only one can become a conscious 
function so do thinking and feeling these four type s of psychological functions correlate and combine 
with either the introverted or the extraverted attitude making for eight demonstrable type s  references
