part  nd ed princeton univer sity press   p p  
 the concept of archetypes as the mode of expre ssion of the collective unconscious is discussed in 
addition to the purely personal uncons cious hypothesized by freud a deeper unconscious level is felt to 
exist this deeper level manifests itself in unive rsal archaic images expres sed in dreams religious 
beliefs myths and fairytales the archetypes as unfiltered psychic experience appear sometimes in 
their most primitive and naive form s in dreams sometimes in a cons iderably more complex form due 
to the operation of conscious elaboration in myths  archetypal images expresse d in religious dogma in 
particular are thoroughly elaborated into formal ized structures which while by expressing the 
unconscious in a circuitous manner prevent direct  confrontation with it since the protestant 
reformation rejected nearly all of the carefully cons tructed symbol structures man has felt increasingly 
isolated and alone without his gods at a loss to replenis h his externalized symbols  he must turn to their 
source in the unconscious the search into the un conscious involves confronting the shadow mans 
hidden nature the animaanimus  a hidden opposite gender in e ach individual and beyond the 
archetype of meaning these are archetypes sus ceptible to personification the archetypes of 
transformation which express the pr ocess of individuation itself are manifested in situations as 
archetypes penetrate consciousness they influence the perceived experience of normal and neurotic 
people a too powerful archetype may totally po ssess the individual and cause psychosis the 
therapeutic process takes the unconsc ious archetypes into account in two ways they are made as fully 
conscious as possible then synthesized with the c onscious by recognition and a cceptance it is observed 
that since modern man has a highly developed abilit y to dissociate simple recognition may not be 
followed by appropriate action it is thus felt that  moral judgment and counsel is often required in the 
course of treatment  
  the concept of the collective unconscious  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol 
 part  nd ed princeton university press   p p   
 the definition modes of manifest ation and function of the collective unconscious are discussed in 
addition to the personal unconscious generally accepted by medical psychology the existence of a 
second psychic system of a universal  and impersonal nature is postulate d this collective unconscious is 
considered to consist of preexistent thought forms called archetype s which give form to certain psychic 
material which then enters the conscious archetyp es are likened to instinctual behavior patterns 
examples of ideas such as the concept of rebirth which occur independently in various cultures and 
ages are advanced as evidence for the collective uncons cious it is felt that ther e are as many archetypes 
as there are recurring situations in  life that when a situ ation occurs that corresponds to a particular 
archetype the archetype presses for completion like an instinctual driv e resistance to its expression may 
result in neurosis the existence of archetypes is demonstrated in the analysis of adult and childhood 
dreams active imagination psychotic delusions and fantasies produced in the trance state a case 
history of a paranoid schizophrenic is examined in  terms of the manifestation of archetypes in the 
patients delusional system  
  concerning the archetypes with spec ial reference to the anima concept  in jung c 
collected works of c g jung vol  part  nd ed princeton university press   p p 
  
the formulation of the archetypes is described as an em pirically derived concept like that of the atom it 
is a conce pt based not onl y on medical evidence but  on observations of m ythical reli gious and literar y 
phenomena these archetypes are considered to be primordial images spont aneous products of the 
psyche which do not reflect any physical process but ar e reflected in them it is noted that while the 
theories of materialism would explain the psyche as  an epiphenomenon of chemical states in the brain 
no proof has yet been found for this hypothesis it is considered more reasonable to view psychic 
production as a generating rather th an a generated factor the anima is the feminine aspect of the 
archetypal malefemale duality whos e projections in the external world can be traced through myth 
philosophy and religious doctrine this duality is of ten represented in mythical syzygy symbols which 
are expressions of parental imagos the singular power of this particular  archetype is considered due to 
an unusually intense repression of  unconscious material concerning the parental imagos archetypal 
images are described as preexistent available and act ive from the moment of birth as possibilities of 
ideas which are subsequently elaborat ed by the individual the anima imag e in particular is seen to be 
active in childhood projecting superhuman qualities  on the mother before sinking back into the 
unconscious under the influence of external reality in a therapeutic sense the concept of the amma is 
considered critical to the understandi ng of male psychology  references

p p   
 in a discussion of the concept of archetypes plato s concept of the idea a primordial disposition that 
preforms and influences thoughts is found to be an early formulation of the archetype hypothesis other 
investigators such as hermann usener are also noted to have recognized the ex istence of universal forms 
of thought jungs contribution is considered to be the demonstration that archetypes are disseminated 
not only through tradition language or migration but that they can anse spontaneously without outside 
influence it is emphasized that an archetype is not predetermined in cont ent rather it is a possibility of 
representation which may be actualiz ed in various ways in this aspect  the archetype is likened to the 
instincts both are predetermined in form onl y and both are only demonstrable through their 
manifestations

 some characteristic aspects of the mother arch etype are delineated including the personal mother 
grandmother stepmother and motherinlaw figure s secondly any woman with whom such a mother 
like relationship exists such as nurse and finall y figurative aspects of mother such as a goddess 
symbols of the mother are seen in abstractions su ch as the goal of redemption objects arousing devotion 
or awe such as sea moon woods  and items representing fertility such as a garden the magical 
protection this archetype implies is similar to that of the mandala figure the mother archetype has two 
aspects she is both loving and terri ble positively the mother arch etype has been associated with 
solicitude wisdom sympathy spiritual ex altation helpful instin cts growth and fertility the negative or 
evil side of the mother archetype is  associated with secrets darkne ss the world of the dead seduction 
and poison because of the power of the mother arch etype it is suggested that the traumatic effects 
produced by a mother upon her children are of two ki nds first those correspondi ng to traits actually 
present in the mother and second those due to traits  which are archet ypal projections on the part of the 
child it is noted that even freud admits of the im portance of infantile fantasy in the development of 
neurosis automatically explaining a childs neoros is by means of unconscious archetypes leads to 
errors instead a thorough inve stigation of the parents is indicated it is felt that the ta sk of the therapist 
is not to deny the archetypes but to dissolve their pr ojections in order to restore their contents to the 
individual

 the mother archetype is described as forming th e foundation of the mother complex in sons through 
the early influence of the actual mother archet ypal structure develops around the mother figure 
producing fantasies which disturb the mothe rchild relationship typical ef fects of the mother complex 
include homosexuality don juanism and sometimes im potence an equal role is played by the anima 
and mother archetype in the formation of the mother  complex since for the male child the perception of 
the mother is complicated by sexual forces in additi on to its pathogenic properties the mother complex 
is considered to have possible benefits for the ma le child in developing and refining in him certain 
essentially feminine qualities

  p p   
 the possible effects of the mother complex in the daughter are described as the hypertrophy of the 
daughters feminine instinct s or its opposite the atrophy of the fe minine instincts the exaggeration of 
the feminine aspect is manifested in the intensificat ion of all female instincts especially the maternal 
instinct the negative aspect of this hypertrophy is seen in women to whom the husband is merely an 
object to be looked after aside from his procr eative function even her ow n life is of secondary 
importance since the womans children are the obj ects of her complex identification the conscious 
development of the eros in this type of woman is described as exclusively a maternal relationship the 
personal eros remains unconscious and is expressed in a will to power this ruthlessness may result in 
the annihilation of her own personality and the lives of her children when the maternal instinct is 
atrophied an overdeveloped eros forms and generall y leads to an unconscious incestuous relationship 
with the father the intensified eros causes an abnormal emphasis on the personality of others the 
woman of this type is often seen to engage  in sensational behavior for its own sake

 two alternatives to the overdevelopment of the eros in the moth er complex of a woman are described 
as identity with the mother and resistance to the mo ther in the former case the daughter projects her 
personality completely on the mother loses her own femi nine instincts due to feelings of inferiority and 
remains devoted to the mother in an unconscious desire  to control her it is noted that the submissive 
vacuousness these daughters display is often very attr active to men the resistance to the mother is 
described as an example of the negative mother comp lex in which behavior patterns of the daughter are 
formed exclusively in opposition to those of the moth er this complex is seen to result in marital 
difficulties indifference to  family based societal organizations and sometimes an extreme intellectual 
development

 the importance of the archetypes in mans relations hip to the world is emphasized they are seen to 
express mans highest values which would be lost in  the unconscious if not for their projection onto the 
external environment an example is the mother archetype which expresses the ideal mother love 
although the projection of this archetpye on the actual mother  an imperfect human being  may lead 
to psychological complications the alte rnative of rejecting the ideal is seen as even more dangerous the 
destruction of this ideal and all ot her irrational expression is seen as  a serious impoverishment of human 
experience further archetypes relegated exclusivel y to the unconscious may intensify to the point of 
distorting perceptive and reasoning powers the equilib rium of rational and irrational psychic forces is 
thus considered essential

 the positive functions an overdeveloped eros type of  mother complex may fulfill are considered this 
type of woman whose behavior of ten develops in reaction to her own mothers instinctive and all 
devouring nature tends to attract men in need of libe ration from similar mothers or wives seen in this 
light the wrecking of marriages wh ich commonly results from such attraction has a positive aspect 
moreover the moral conflict aroused in men who are the objects of the attraction is seen as conducive to 
increased selfknowledge and a highe r degree of consciousness it is suggested that even the woman 
with this type of mother complex may benefit from the same conflict becoming more aware of her role 
of deliverer and possibly even consci ously fulfilling it i reference

 the possibility for positive development on the part of a woman who is so identified with her mother 
that her own instincts are paralyzed is seen to de pend upon her emptiness bei ng filled by a male anima 
projection once stolen from her mother this woma n may eventually come to selfawareness through 
utlimate resentment of her submissive role as a wi fe if she remains unconscious of her own personality

 the possibility for positive development of the wo man with a negative mother complex is discussed 
although as a pathological phenomenon this type of woman is an unpleasant and exacting partner in 
marriage it is felt that with experience this wo man may actually have the best chance to make her 
marriage a success during the second half of her life first she must give up fighting he r mother in the 
personal sense but she will always remain hostile to the feminine qualities of darkness and ambiguity 
and will choose clarity and reason her cool judgment and objectivity can give this type of woman 
understanding of the individuality of her husband that goes beyond the erotic she may become the 
friend sister and competent advisor of her husband all this can only be achieved if the complex is faced 
and lived out to its fullest the biblical character of lo ts wife is described as an example of this type of 
woman who has an unconscious reactiv e view of reality dominated by th e exclusively feminine aspect 
when this type of woman attains greater consciousness  of herself her rare combination of womanliness 
and masculine understandin g is beneficial in the work environment as well as in intimate personal 
relationships a man may project a positive mother  complex on a woman with masculine qualities 
because she is easier to understand than one with another type of mother complex understanding this 
type of woman moreover is not seen as frighteni ng to a man rather it is conducive to confidence a 
quality often absent in the relationship between men and women  
  psychological aspects of the mo ther archetype  conclusion in jung c collected works 
of c g jung vol  part  nd ed princet on university press   p p   
 general observations on the mother  complex and examples taken from mythology and history are used 
to support the concept of an unconscious origin for the mother archetype the experience of the mother 
archetype is described as beginning in the state of unconscious identity in which the child first 
encounters the actual mother gradua lly as the ego is differentiated from the mother mysterious 
qualities originally attached to her ar e transferred to a female figure close to her such as a grandmother 
finally as consciousness becomes clearer the ar chetype recedes into the unconscious assuming 
mythological proportions once the mo ther archetype is projected upon myth or fairytale its opposite 
aspects may split apart creating a good and an ev il goddess for example the essential diffemece 
between the operation of the mother image in a ma ns psychology and in a womans is stressed the 
mother typifies a womans own conscious life but is an alien figure to a man and is surrounded with 
imagery from the unconscious it is noted that the mythological project ion of the mother archetype the 
great mother often appear s with her male counterpart creating th e archetype of paired opposites which 
is the symbol of psychic individua tion the dogma of the assumption is proposed as a modern effort to 
compensate the dominance of rational and material sc ience with its archetypal opposite creating thereby 
a balanced world it is suggested that this type of  symbolic compensation and unity constitutes the only 
way man is able to organize and understa nd his role in the world  references  
  concerning rebirth  forms of rebirth in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  
part  nd ed princeton universi ty press   p p   
five different forms of rebirth are defined and descri bed metempsychosis or transmigration of souls is 
described as life extended in time by passing th rough different bodily existences an eternal life 
interrupted by different reincarnations  this concept does not require a continuity of personality even in 
buddhism where it is of pa rticular importance but only continuity  of karma in reincarnation human 
personality is regarded as continuous  previous existences are at least potentially available to awareness 
since the same ego is presumed to exist throughout the various lives these lives are generally thought 
be exclusively human the third form  of rebirth resurrection is define d as a reestablishment of human 
existence after death with the impli cation of some change or transf ormation of the being a different 
place or body may be involved in transformation the ch ange of body can be either in the carnal or the 
nonmaterial sense rebi rth in its fourth form renovatio is de scribed as rebirth wi thin the span of 
individual life this rebirth may ei ther consist of some healing or st rengthening of a part of the physical 
or psychological being without essential change of the whole or of a profound basic change in the 
essential nature of the individual called transmutat ion examples are offered such as the assumption of 
the body of the mother of god into heaven after her deat h the fifth form of rebirth is seen as an indirect 
one in which the individual witnesses or takes part in  some rite of transformation and thereby shares a 
divine grace it is exemplified by the witnessing of transubstantiation in the mass or the confession of 
the initiate in the eleusinian  mysteries  reference

princeton university press   p p   
the psychic im portance of the conce pt of rebirth a nd two main t ypes of transformation ex periences are 
discussed it is felt that the rebirth concept can only be understood by examining history since rebirth 
itself is a purely psychic reality transmitted only i ndirectly through personal statements the affirmation 
of the concept of rebirth among many different peoples is taken as support for its archetypal quality it is 
contended that psychology must deal with psychi c events underlying the af firmations of rebirth 
especially regarding the two main groups of transfor mation experiences that of the transcendence of 
life and that of individual transf ormation the experience of the transc endence of life can be induced by 
ritual in which the initiate takes part in some sacred  rite revealing to him the continuity of life the 
transformation does not take place within the init iate but outside him although he may become 
involved in the transformation the experience of the christian mass is described as an example of this 
type of experience in which lif e is transcended in a moment  of eternity  reference

princeton university pre ss   p p   
 in addition to transcendence experienced through ritual  a second transcendence of life is described as a 
spontaneous ectastic or visionary experience of mystery w ithout the aid of ritual nietzsches noontide 
vision is discussed as a classic exam ple of this type of transformation  in the myth of dionysuszagreus 
who was dismembered and returned to life the deity appears in the noon hour sacr ed to pan nietzches 
reaction is as though he had been pres ent at a ritual it is cautioned that these are more esthetic forms of 
experience like dreams which have no lasting effect on the dreamer and that they must be distinguished 
from those visions which involve permanent change in the individual  references  
  concerning rebirth  the psychology of reb irth  subjective transformation a 
diminution of personality  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  part  nd ed 
princeton university press   p p   
the diminution of personality as the result of a pers onality transformati on is described as different from 
the changes produced by a mystical experience it is  noted that transformations of personality are 
already familiar to psychology and appear in psyc hopathology the primitive psychology refers to this 
diminution of personality as loss of  soul the impression that the s oul has been suddenly lost is in 
accordance with the nature of primitive consciousness  which lacks the coherence of that of civilized 
man the experience of civilized man is seen as s imilar to that of primitive man but felt more as a 
lessening of conscious tonus the consequent listle ssness and loss of will advance to the point of 
distintegration in which individual pa rts of personality escape from conscious control as in the case of 
hysterical phenomena this diminuti on of personality abaissement du niveau mental is described as 
resulting from physical or mental  fatigue physical illness violent em otions or shock and leading to a 
narrowing of mental horizons and possibly to the de velopment of a negative cast which falsifies the 
original personality

enlargement of personality  in jung c collected works of c g jung vol  part  nd ed 
princeton university press   p p   
 the transformation resulting in an enlargement of personality is described as the accretion of new 
experiences from without coupled w ith the response of some inner el ement to these experiences new 
experiences cannot be assimilated unless the inne r amplitude is equal to the incoming material 
therefore without psychic depth an individual lacks the capacity to relate to the magnitude of 
experience and a difficult task ma y destroy rather than benefit him  a literary example of such an 
enlargement is seen in nietzsches description of zarathustra religious  and cultural illustrations of the 
process are found in the christ fi gure in indian culture  and in the islamic le gend of moses and khidr it 
is noted that the enlargement of pe rsonality can occur in smaller ways  as may be illustrated by the case

 changes of personality are detaile d that involve structur al alterations in personality rather than 
enlargement or diminution the phenomenon of possess ion in which some idea content or part of 
personality gains mastery of the i ndividual is characterized as one of the most important forms of 
change in structure possession is described as iden tity of the ego personality with a complex with no 
strict differentiation made betw een possession and paranoia a co mmon instance of possession and 
concomitant structural change in the personality is se en in an individuals identity with the persona the 
manner the individual assumes in dealing with the worl d life is then lived only as a public biography 
other examples of possession of parts of the persona lity are described as the possession by an inferior 
function which results in the individuals living be low his own level and possession by the anima or 
animus which gives prominence in the personality ch aracteristics of the opposit e sex in unusual cases 
states of possession may be observed to involve the soul of some forbear evidence for this type of 
transformation is found in leon daudets book lhere do and in the common importance of ancestral 
roles in society  references

princeton university press   p p   
 a form of transformation experience is described which occurs when an individual identifies with a 
group of people who have a collect ive experience of transformation this type of experience is 
distinguished from participation in a transformation rite which does not necessarily depend upon or 
give rise to a group identity tr ansformation as a group experience is described as taking place on a 
lower level of consciousness than transformation as  an individual because the total psyche emerging 
from a group is more like the animal psyche than the human although the group e xperience is easier to 
achieve it does not cause a permanent change once th e individual is removed from the group events in 
prewar germany are cited as typifying the results of inevitable psychological regression which takes 
place in a group when ritual is not introduced to counteract uncons cious instinctuality although this 
evaluation of mass psychology is conceded to be essent ialiv negative it is point ed out that the mass can 
also have positive effects by fo stering courage and dignity however  these gifts are considered to 
become dangerous if they are taken for granted and st ifle personal efforts to achieve them  references

 identification with some god or hero who is transforme d in a sacred ritual is discussed as an important 
form of personality transformation the metamorphosis  of apuleius the osiris cult of egypt and the 
christian tradition are detailed as examples of this  phenomenon the latter is considered to represent a 
culmination of this transformation in the idea that everyone has an immortal soul and shares in the 
godhead further development of this idea is seen to lead to the concept of christ in each individual

 two further forms of personality transformation beyond identification with a cult hero are suggested 
instead of the transformation occuring through an indivi duals participation in a sa cred rite the rite may 
be expressly utilized to effect the transformation which takes place fr om the outside as an individual 
submits to a technique magical tr ansformation techniques of primitive  societies usually involve some 
physical procedure such as pulling a sick person thr ough hole in the wall or through a leather cow or a 
renaming to give the individual another soul nonmagical techniques de signed to produce psychic 
changes are exemplified by the practice of yoga  a fairy tale illustrates how spontaneous

 in addition to technical processes of personality  transformation a natural individuation process is 
described as involving a spontaneous maturing of the pe rsonality natural transfor mation is evidenced in 
dreams symbolizing rebirth and in the intercourse between consciousness and some inner voice this 
latter phenomenon commonly described as talking to oneself is seen as meditation in the alchemical 
sense the inner voice is generall y regarded as nonsense or as the voice of god its real nature 
considered to be an unconscious count erpart to the ego it is felt that if  this psychic partner is recognized 
by the ego consciousness the conflict between the two can have a positive effect in alchemy in ancient 
cults and in religion this inner pres ence is found personified as an exte rnal being such as mercurius or

 p p   
 an example of the symbolism of transformation is found in the khidr myth of  islamic mysticism which 
appears in the eighteenth sura of th e koran the cave which appears in this text is seen as a symbol of 
the unconscious the entry into the cave is the begi nning of a process of psychic transformation which 
may result in a substantial personality change  moral observations which follow the legend are 
considered as counsel to those w ho will not achieve transformation a nd who must substitute adherence 
to the law for true rebirth the enusing story of mo ses and his servant amplifies and explains the first 
tale the catch and subsequent loss of the fish by moses symbolizes an incomplete contact with the 
nourishing influenc i the unconscious the appearance of khidr in the legend is elt to represent the 
greater self which can gui de the ego nsciousness moses toward increased wisdom an ab t transition 
follows and a story is told by moses concerning kh idr and his friend dhulguar nein although it is in 
fact moses who is interacting with khidr this substi tution is interpreted in terms of a retreat from the 
psychic danger of a direct confrontation of the ego consciousness with the self an allusion to the 
rebuilding of walls is seen as a symbol  of the protection of the self and of the individuation  process it is 
concluded that the khidr figures significance in is lamic mysticism is due to this legends complete 
expression of the archetype of individuation  references

 a brief history of psychological philosophy is given to explain the long obscurity in regard to the 
unconscious as the essential nature  of the psyche in dream anal ysis the existence of typical 
mythologems among individuals leads to  the conclusion that myth formi ng structural elements must be 
present in the unconscious psyche the child archetype  is cited as an example of such a primordial 
image called archetype which may be found in myths fairytales and psychotic fa ntasies as well as in 
dreams due to the undeveloped natu re of primitive man the unconscious  and its archetypes are seen to 
intrude spontaneously into his conscious mind t hus primitive man does not invent myth but only 
experience it in modem man products of the unconscious  may be divided into two categories fantasies 
of a personal nature which can be traced to repression by the individual  and fantasies of an impersonal 
nature not individually acquired which correspond to inherited coll ective elements of the human 
psyche this second category is given the name colle ctive unconscious it is explained that unconscious 
material can enter the consciousness during a state of  reduced conscious intensity such as in dream 
when the control of the unconscious by the conscious  mind ceases archetypes are described as living 
psychic forces which can promote human growth a nd which when neglected may cause neurotic or 
even psychotic disorders the archetype of the chil d god appears to be widesp read examples from myth 
and legend such the christ child the alchemical child motif and the figure of the dwarf or elf are cited 
the most significant manife station of the child motif in psychothe rapy is described as ocurring in the 
maturation process of personality induced by analysis  of the unconscious or the individuation process

active imagination  references

the difficulty of completely explaining the meaning of an archetype a psychic organ within every man 
is acknowledged with the warning that a poor explanat ion of it may result in injury to that psychic 
organ it is felt that the explanat ion of the archetype should be such  that an adequate and meaningful 
connection between the conscious mind and the ar chetypes is assured a nd that the functional 
significance of the archetype remains unimpaired th e archetypes role in the psychic structure is 
described as representing or personsifying certain  instinctive data from the unconscious the 
preoccupation of the primiti ve mentality with magic cited as evidence for the importance of the 
connection to primitive psyc hic contents is seen as the basis of modern religion the child archetype is

 the function of the child archetype in regard to  modern man is outlined the purpose of the child 
archetype is seen as the compensation or correction of the inevitable onesidedne ss and extravagance of 
the conscious mind the natural result of conscious c oncentration on a few contents to the exclusion of 
all others modem mans developed wi ll is described as affording hum an freedom but also the greater 
possibility of transgression agains t the instincts compensation through the still exist ing state of 
childhood is considered necessary to prevent the uprooting of modem mans differentiated 
consciousness symptoms of compensation such as  backwardness and regressive behavior are 
evaluated negatively by modem man wh ereas primitive man sees them as  natural in keeping with law 
and tradition dissociati on of consciousness is seen to facilitate a separation of one part of the psyche 
from the rest resulting in the fals ification of the personality through the force of the separated part thus 
if the childhood state of the collective psyche is  suppressed the unconscious may inhibit or even 
overwhelm the conscious function

 since the child is essentially a potential being the child motif in the psychology of the individual 
signifies generally the anti cipation of future even though the motif appears to operate in a retrospective

 the child motif as an archetypal image is noted to manifest itself as unity or plurality when a number 
of children appear with no individua l characteristics a dissociation of th e personality such as is found in 
schizophrenia is indicated while the appearance of the child as a unity is felt to represent a potential 
synthesis of the personality the app earance of the child may be in the form of a god or hero with the 
miraculous birth and early advers ities common to both the child god is seen as a symbol of the 
unintegrated unconscious the child hero combining hum an and supernatural qualities is considered a 
symbol of the potential for individuation the typical fa tes of the child figures ar e interpreted as symbols 
of psychic events which occur during the entelechy gen esis of the self as the psyche struggles toward 
wholeness

 danger to and abandonment of the archetypal child figure are interpreted in psychological terms the 
universal themes of the ch ilds insignificant be ginnings and miraculous birth are interpreted as psychic 
experiences whose object is the emergence of a ne w and as yet unknown content moments of psychic 
conflict from which there is no conscious means of escape are de scribed as causing the unconscious to 
create a third presence of  an irrational nature which the consci ous mind neither expects nor understands 
one example of this unknown content is the symbolic  emergence of the child figure since the child 
figure represents a moving towards psychic independence the symbol of abandonment is a necessary 
precondition for the detachment of the child motif from its origins the symbol of the child anticipates a 
new higher state of consciousness which may remain on ly a mythological projection if it is not actually 
integrated in the being of the individual it is not ed that the moral conflict unique to modem man like 
the physical conflict of primitive times is still a life threateni ng situation affording no escape as

extinction he possesses supernatural powers far beyond the human similarly in si tuations of conflict 
within the conscious mind the combatant forces are described as so overwhelming that the child as an 
isolated content bears no relation to the conscious elem ents present and may easily return to 
unconsciousness yet the child personifi es the most vital urge to reali ze the self and as such has great 
power the development of the power of the child is traced through ancient myth and alchemical 
symbolism hindu thought is noted to recognize th e psychological necessity of detachment and 
confrontation with the unconscious to make the pr ogress of consciousness possible it is considered 
necessary for modem medicine to  realize that the archetypes unde rlying these fantasies cannot be

the kore figure belonging in man to the anima type and in woman to the supraordinate personality or 
the self like the other psychic figures the kore is observed to have both positive and negative 
manifestations images such as the kore are considered to rise from an area of the personality which has 
an impersonal collective nature and to express this psychic material in the c onscious the experience o f

 a definition of the word spirit is proposed an d a descniption of the historical and mythical 
characteristics of the spirit is pr esented the great number of differen t definitions of the term in use 
today is considered to make it difficult to delimit any one concep t however these definitions in 
combination are considered to provide a vivi d and concrete view of the phenomenon in the 
psychological sense spirit is defined as a fundamental  complex which was originally felt as an invisible 
but dynamic living presence this concept is seen to pr ecede the christian view of  the spirit as superior 
to nature the contrasting material istic view developed under antichri stian influence is based on the 
premise that the spirit is in fact determined by natu re just as the psychic functions are considered to 
depend on neurochernical phenomena it is contended that while spir it and matter may eventually be 
revealed as identical at present th e reality of psychic contents and processes in themselves cannot be 
denied the spirit is conceived as originally external  to man now although it has been internalized in 
the consciousness it is still crea tive rather than created binding ma n and influencing him just as the 
external physical world does it is seen as aut onomous and therefore capable  of manifesting itself

knowledge needed to overcome the heros difficulties  appears in the shape of a wise old man the old 
men in fairytales often ask questions of the hero or heroine for the purpose of mobilizing their moral

representing knowledge reflection insi ght wisdom cleverness and intuit ion as well as moral qualities 
such as goodwill and readiness to help which make hi s spiritual character clear even in fairytales the 
old man has a clear link with the psychic unconscious as in the case of a forest king connected with 
water and wood symbols which are themselves sym bols for the unconscious the spirit archetype like 
all other archetypes is seen to have a negative as well as a positive aspect expressed in the actions or 
appearance of the the wise old man figure the ma nifestation of the good and evil aspects are often

susceptible to differentiation while one remains c onnected to the unconscious and inaccessible to the

psychological individual but that i nvestigation of multiple personality  has proved the existence of an 
unconscious area of personality in a ddition to the conscious area ther e does not appear to be a ruling 
principle analogous to the ego in the unconscious  as unconscious phenomena are manifested in 
unsystematic ways the conscious and unconcious may a ppear separate in that the conscious is unaware 
of the contents of the unconscious yet cases are pr esented to demonstate that it is possible for the 
unconscious to swamp the ego or that under the influence of strong emotion the ego and the 
unconscious may change places as the unconscious becomes autonomous the unc onscious contains not

circle drawn in religious rituals the function of the mandala is described as a narrowing down of the 
psychic field of vision as an aid to intensificat ion of concentration the goal of the yogi in 
contemplating the processes depicted in the mandala is to become inwardly aw are of the deity through 
contemplation the practitioner may realize himself as god and return  from the illusion of individual 
existence into the universal totality of the divine the basic psychological motif of the mandala is of a 
center of personality to which everything is related by which everything is arranged and which itself is 
a source of energy the energy of the central point is  manifested in the compulsion to become what one 
is this desired presence may be called the self  the self is surrounded in the mandala by an area 
containing the paired oppos ites that make up personality the totality of the mandala contains 
consciousness a personal unconscious and an indefini tely large area of collective unconscious whose 
archetypes are common to all mankind some of these ar chetypes are within the sc ope of personality and 
may acquire an individual stamp such as the anima the anim us and the shadow other religious

the production of mandalas in a therap eutic context is felt to occur in  states of chaos or panic as a 
rearranging of the personality toward a new center patients are said to appreciate the soothing effects of 
these pictures which emphasize whol eness order and balance it is  noted that the reality of the

 the meaning and function of the mandala is briefly described the sanskrit word mandala is defined as 
meanin g circle in reli gious practice and psycholo gy the word refers to circular ima ges which are 
drawn painted or danced as psychological phenomena they appear spontaneous ly in dreams certain 
states of mental conflict and in schizophrenia often the mandala contains some figure in a multiple of 
four in the form of a cross or square the mandala in tibetan buddhism is calle d a yantra and aids in 
meditation and concentration in alch emy it represents the synthesis of  the four elements which tend to 
fall apart in psychology the severe order imposed by a circular image of this kind compensates the 
disorder and confusion of the psychic state of the i ndividual this process is described as a natural and 
instinctive attempt at selfhealing since the material e xpressed in them is essentailly archetypal there is 
fundamental similarity of  mandalas regardless of origin the mandala commonly represents psychic 
wholeness through the squaring of the circle the objec t of individual mandalas is described as locating 
the self which can be distinguished from the ego wher eas the ego is described as  the point of reference 
for consciousness the self is at the midpoint of personality and for this reason many mandalas show a 
dark and light half representing the conscious and unconscious divisions of personality the therapeutic 
effect of mandalas is felt to consist in their s pontaneous production no therapeutic value is thought 
possible for the imitation or repetition of such images

the concepts of self and unconscious  as related to the ego are descri bed the somatic and psychic bases 
of the ego are said to contain both conscious and unc onscious factors three levels of content are posited 
in the unconscious that which can be produced vol untarily memory that which cannot be produced 
voluntarily but can be produced involuntarily and th at which can never be produced from earlier 
discussions it is inferred that the ego is the cente r of consciousness but not th e center of the personality 
since it is but a part of the personality and so contai ned within it the center of  the personality is more 
properly labeled as the self the ego is viewed as arisi ng from the continuous interplay of the persons 
inner and outer experiences its ch aracteristics are unique to each individual but its  elements are 
common to all individuals its ability to change a nd develop in each person over a period of time is 
discussed finally the notion of th e collective unconscious is introduced  and described as a subdivision

anima the shadow is de scribed as composed of the dark elem ents of the personality having an 
emotional and primitive nature which resists moral control the most resistant elements are usually 
associated with certain emotionally toned projections since projections are attached to external objects 
it is unlikely that the individua l involved in them will recogni ze their source within his own 
unconscious in extreme cases of pr ojection the individual may become  completely cut off from his 
environment and will live in a selfperpetuating worl d of illusion it is noted however that the most 
intense projections arise not from the shadow but fr om the animus in a woman or the anima in a man 
since these archetypes are of a gender opposite that of the conscious individua l their projections are 
even more difficult to recognize than those of th e shadow which represents primarily the personal 
unconscious

the nature of the animusanima archetypes and of  the projections arising from them are described 
these archetypes from the collective unconscious reincar nated in each child are seen to combine with 
the early experience of the child with the opposite ge nder parent to create the mother imago in boys and 
the father imago in girls becaus e of the opposite sex nature of animusanima projections they are 
almost impossible to recognize as emanating from ones own psyche whereas the shadows same sex 
projections are considered to be more easily identifi ed the difficulty of diss olving such projections is 
seen to reside in the nature of archetypes as elements of the collectiv e unconscious although the 
contents of the animusanima can be  integrated into the conscious they themselves remain separate as 
constituents of basic psychic structure it is not ed that the realization of  the shadow which makes 
possible a recognition of the animus or anima is the first stage of the analytic process recognition is 
only considered possible through an individuals relati on to a partner and the formation of the quaternal 
marriage structure this quaternion formed in the male  of himself his female partner the transcendent 
anima and the wise old man archetype and in the wo man of herself her male partner the animus and 
the chthonic mother archetype is noted to be the scheme for the structure of the self and for the 
structure of primitive society  references  
 the self  in jung c collected works of c g  jung vol  part  nd ed princeton

the self is defined in its relationship to the ego and the instincts and the selfs striving for wholeness is 
related to the parallel striving of the collective un conscious for wholeness as typified in the mandala 
symbols and ultimately in the figure of christ it  is explained that the self is motivated by the 
unconscious whereas the ego exists in the conscious  as long as the two are in equilibrium the 
personality is functioning normally however when th e self is assimilated by the ego or the ego by the 
self the result is inflation of either the unconsci ous or the conscious to the detriment of the total 
personality the striving of th ese forces is seen in individuals as instincts or natural forces the need for 
equilibrium between them is felt as a need for wholeness this c onflict is seen to be represented 
throughout history by the quaternity or  mandala symbols which are valued because of their similarity to 
the god image the ultimate unity understanding of the manda la is felt to grow from experiential rather 
than intellectual processes the self is the basis of all theories of unity which are part of all religions 
insofar as christian symbols no longer express what  is now welling up from the unconscious the value 
of christianity in the modern world is seen to be meaningless and hollow  references

the archetype of the self as expr essed in the image of christ incl uding their respective opposites of 
shadow and antichrist is discussed in a critical revi ew of scripture and of th e writing of the gnostics 
christ is seen as a symbol of the archetypal god im age whose descent to hell and resurrection have 
psychological equivalents in the integration of the collective unconscious which plays an essential part 
in the psychic individuation process  however while the original chri stian god image appears to have 
included even the dark animal side of man the chri st symbol lacks wholeness because of the exclusion 
of this inferior aspect of the personality and its extemalization in th e form of the antichrist christ 
then is an incomplete symbol of the self to be whole the archetype must express both good and evil the 
conscious as well as the unconscious it is noted that  in a premanichaean gnos ticchristian text dating 
from about ad  the equality of good and evil wa s recognized and in fact creation as a whole was 
viewed as a structure of paired opposites syzygies a schema of the transcendent al nature of christ and 
the self is based upon a quaternion composed of opposites paired which apply to both a similar 
quaternion illustrates the unit yopposition of good and evil s piritual and material further analo gies to 
the structure of christian symbolism are found in  alchemical texts and in psychological theory 
particularly in regard to the impurity of the body a nd the opposing purity of the spirit the distinction 
between the metaphysical and the psychological pers pective in the study of the christ image is 
emphasized the psychological view is phenomenological  it is concerned with  the description and 
analysis of archetypal images not with their truth or falsehood as expressions of religious faith it is in 
the psychological sense that christ and the alchem ical symbol of the lapis philosophorum may be 
identified as like symbolic expr essions of the ideal wholeness of the self the christian concept of 
redemption is not devalued by this association ra ther it is reinforced as an expression of the 
psychological imperative of reunion of  opposites it is felt that if this  process is not realized by the 
individual and by civilization as a whole world conflict will be the inevitable result  references

expression of the vitalizing archetype of the spirit this movement influenced some of the greatest 
religious and scientific theorists but was elsewh ere degraded and distorted by revolutionaries and 
anarchists in the antichristian era the analysis of fi sh symbolism is resumed and related to the change in 
outlook which began with the renaissance in the astr ological sense whereas the age of the fishes is 
ruled by the conflict of opposite forces the aquarian  age which follows it brings about the union of 
these opposites the first fish is christ the second an tichrist and the contact between them occurs at

self any imbalance in its expression such as the suppr ession of the concept of evil in late christianity

white and sometimes as black and from this union of opposites its magical powers were derived the 
fish supposedly lived in the center of the ocean or  the center of the spirit of the world for the
