introduction
coincidence as understood through jungs concept of synchronicity is a
phenomenon in which the self confronts an important aspect of its ownnature philosophers have paid little attention to the meaning of coincidenceand to jungs formulation of it the lack of attention to this aspect of the selfsexistence is part of the general pattern of modern philosophy as it has developedsince descartes
cartesian philosophy set the agenda of modern philosophy in terms of 
the search for a single method of right reasoning in the sciences based in thelogical mathematical and analytic powers of thought
part of the connection
of philosophy to the new physical sciences was adherence to their conceptionsof causality as the standard for the explanation of any event or set of events
one of the best and most succinct characterizations of the difference between 
the cartesian focus on a single method of truth and the vichian humanisthistorical form ofreasoning is isaiah berlins essay the divorce between the sciences and the humanities berlin 
in human experience although cartesian philosophy takes the cogito  the 
i think as its first principle its archimedean point it considers the self only interms of its cognitive power and abandons the whole self with its paradoxesmystical dimensions selfimages and insights many twentiethcentury move 
ments in philosophy have been reactions to the narrowness of this cartesianposition among these are existentialism phenomenology structuralism her 
meneutics and various forms of postmodernism but these movements alongwith descartes have abandoned the great humanist systems of the renaissanceand those of the ancients such as those of pythagoras and the pythagoreansand plotinus and the neoplatonists 
jung studied and revived these systems missing in these contemporary
movements is any attempt to reclaim socratic philosophy
cicero said 
socrates was the first to call philosophy down from the heavens and set her in the
cities of men and bring her also into their homes and compel her to ask questionsabout life and morality and things good and evil
tusc v  
socrates brings philosophy to the human level from the heavens where the
presocratic physicists had left it by recalling the importance of the oldestprinciple of wisdom in western thought the inscription on the temple of apolloat delphi gnothi seauton  know thyself socrates is not simply a dialectician
he is also the figure who is guided by his personal daemon his supernatural
sign or voice as he says in the apology cd he is known to go into
trances as he does at the beginning of the symposium ab and he is a
teller of myths of the afterlife as he does in the phaedo bc and the
republic bb socrates selfknowledge is one of the great themes
of neoplatonism and of renaissance humanism
jungs works are one of the prime places anyone interested in bringing
philosophy back to humanistic concerns can go today jung has importantlyunderstood that synchronicity is part of selfknowledge my aim in the remarksthat follow is to support this view while calling attention to some of its implica 
tions that jung has not stressed attention to the phenomenon of coincidenceand synchronicity is not the sum and substance of selfknowledge but it is astart it is a key to seeing other sides to the self than the cognitive and causalpatterns of experience that dominate so much of contemporary thought
in addition to examples of coincidence and synchronicity in ordinary lived
experience one of jungs primary examples of the functioning of acausality is donald phillip verene
an exception to these positions in twentiethcentury philosophy is ernst cassirers philosophy
of culture which he conceives as a revival of the socratic theme of selfknowledge he begins an
essay on man with the claim that selfknowledge is the highest aim of philosophical inquiry
cassirer   p  cassirer regards the socratic quest for selfknowledge as tied to the basis
phenomenon of werk work in the sense of an artwork a form of culture that underlies his
metaphysics of symbolic forms cassirer   pp 
the i ching yijing the i ching is both a book of practical divination and 
a book of wisdom understood in this latter sense it contains a metaphysicsin which all change occurs through opposites and all events are repetitions ofother events jung says about the i ching as a book of wisdom that it insists
upon selfknowledge throughout wilhelm   p xxxiii although the 
i ching is a work of interest to western culture it also remains distant from it 
the foreignness of the i ching raises a question is there a metaphysics
within the western tradition that would support the acausal principle ofsynchronicity and tie it to the aim of selfknowledge such a metaphysics canbe found in the thought of giambattista vico the founder of the philosophyof history vicos new science allows us to situate the psychological principle
of synchronicity within a metaphysics of history and the self such that the selfencounters itself in the repetitions of history vico is the thinker who providesthis perspective in modern philosophy
many readers have first learned of vico through james joyce vicos new
science  as is commonly known was one of joyces books at the wake one
of the prime sources along with the works of dante swift shakespeare etcthat joyce drew on as the basis for finnegans wake  although joyce and jung
had an uneasy personal relationship finnegans wake became a monumental
literary embodiment of the pervasive principle of synchronicity in the humanworld
joyce allows the reader to see how acausality is at the very basis of
human activity and language and how such connections are reachable throughthe power of the imagination
vico provides a philosophical way and joyce a literary way to grasp jungs
principle of synchronicity within modern western consciousness vicos philo 
sophical and joyces literary formulations help to amplify jungs principlewhich in turn enables us to read vico and joyce in a new light although jungnever mentions vico there is a striking parallel between jungs discovery of syn 
chronicity in psychological terms and vicos discovery of it in philosophicalterms the parallel deserves to be made explicit vico and jung have not onehistorical source in common what they do have in common are all the classictexts of the italians latins and greeks which focus on aspects of the self thatthe cartesian mentality excludesjung vico and joyce 
i have retained the title i ching throughout rather than yijing the title in accordance with the
pinyin system of transliteration jung knew the work under the title i ching german i ging 
from wilhelms translation the rendering of wilhelms german version into english wasundertaken by cary f baynes at jungs request wilhelm   p xli the english version
which contains jungs foreword retains this spelling of the title it follows the older wadesystem of transliteration and uses it to put the german version of chinese words into english forother chinese titles terms and proper names i have employed pinyin  except in the section on
finnegans wake  where i have retained joyces spellings
joyce did not like jungs  review of ulysses  but he was grateful for jungs attempt to treat
the schizophrenia of his daughter lucia ellmann   pp 
jungs principle of synchronicity
in causal theory little attention is given to coincidence coincidence is
regarded as a kind of chance and like chance it is assumed that any instanceof coincidence when fully investigated can be causally explained at most itis thought that repeated coincidental associations of events can have signifi 
cance for causal investigation as suggesting the possibility of an inapparentunderlying cause although chance is a functional element in causal inves 
tigations such investigations ultimately regard all occurrences in experience ascausally explicable in principle if not in fact
everyone has experienced a coincidence of events or circumstances either in
minor ways or dramatically or has heard such phenomena impressively relatedby others coincidence is a phenomenon in all cultures jung characterizedcoincidence of a certain sort as synchronicity understood as an acausalconnecting principle    jung intends synchronicity to designate a case
of meaningful coincidence  as distinguished from meaningless chance group 
ings ibid para  for a coincidence to be meaningful in his sense it must
have a profound effect on us it must be something more than merely interest 
ing odd or mildly notable synchronicity should be distinguished from syn 
chronism which designates only the simultaneous occurrence of two eventspara 
jung says 
synchronicity therefore consists of two factors a an unconscious image comes
into consciousness either directly that is literally or indirectly symbolized or suggestedin the form of a dream idea or premonition b an objective situation coincides
with this content
para  
synchronicity involves having already in the mind an event or circumstance
that exists or will actually exist in the world in space and time without grasp 
ing this on the basis of or predicting its occurrence from any causal principle
jung finds that there are three kinds of such phenomena 
 the coincidence of a psychic state in the observer with a simultaneous
objective external event that corresponds to the psychic state or contentsome thing inexplicably comes to mind and is preoccupying just as
inexplicably or unexpectedly what has come to mind actually appears
 the coincidence of a psychic state with a corresponding more or less
simultaneous external event taking place outside the observers field of per 
ception ie at a distance and only verifiable afterward an event or
circumstance comes to mind and becomes a preoccupying thought laterone learns that such a thing actually took place at about the same time onewas thinking of it
 the coincidence of a psychic state with a corresponding not yet existent
future event that is distant in time and can likewise only be verified donald phillip verene
afterward para  this is foreknowledge the future is seen before it
happens this foreknowledge is like causal prediction in that it is an effectiveanticipation of the future except no causes are analysed and no projectionsfrom them are made the future is simply seen in the present and what is
present to conscious ness is borne out by its later actual occurrence
an example of the first type is the sudden and preoccupying thought of a
friend one has not had contact with for many years and whose whereaboutsare unknown at that same moment while the thought is going on the door 
bell rings and the friend appears jung relates a more elaborate example of triplecoincidence told by the astronomer camille flammarion m deschampswhen a boy was given a piece of special plum pudding by m de fortgibu tenyears later when attempting to order such a plum pudding in a paris restaur 
ant he discovered it had already been ordered by m de fortgibu years laterdeschamps was given a piece of this type of plum pudding at a party heremarked that the only thing lacking was m de fortgibu and at that momentthe door opened and a very old man walked in it was m de fortgibu some 
what disoriented who had mistaken the address and burst in on the partyuninvited jung   para  fn 
this first category may also include the phenomenon of dj vu  in which
one realizes that the details of an actual situation or a place in which oneunexpectedly finds oneself are somehow already present in ones mind ibidpara  in this category may be the outofbody experiences in neardeath
occurrences in which the victim or patient observes all that is happening atthe scene of an accident or during a surgical operation and while havingseemed to be unconscious or comatose can later relate precisely all that wassaid and done at the scene moody  
examples of the second type of coincidence are persons who have a dream
or a premonition of the death accident or peril of a relative or friend who isin another city only later to learn that the event imagined actually occurred atnearly that time jung gives an example of one of his patients whom he sent toa specialist to be examined for heart disease although his symptoms seemedinnocuous his wife became anxious while he was visiting the specialist because
a flock of birds began to gather on their house she recalled that such birds hadarrived outside the house at the deaths of both her mother and grandmotherwhile walking home her husband collapsed in the street and died a note inhis pocket from the specialist said that his examination showed no cause forconcern jung   para 
examples of the third type of coincidence would include all types of fore 
knowledge derived from dreams or waking states one possible example wasrelated to me by a friend as part of her personal experience she and her hus 
band embarked on a camping weekend in a national forest in the campground
they found themselves next to a group who were sitting around a campfire anddrinking heavily she and her husband turned in early in the middle of thejung vico and joyce 
night she awoke from a dream that everything was on fire around the tent but
she saw no sign of fire the dream was vivid enough that she woke her hus 
band and insisted he check the camp he was reluctant to get up and fell backasleep she was so affected by the dream she could not sleep and lay awakefor some period of time off and on trying to rouse him when he at last suc 
cumbed to her prodding and exited the tent he saw the campfire left unattendedsuddenly ignite the dry pine trees above it which burst into rapidly spreadingflames their shouts saved everyone a few moments later all would have beenengulfed in flames while they were asleep in the fire dream the foreseen eventwas not distant in time but it need not be to fit the third type of coincidence
causality
jung claims synchronicity designates a hypothetical factor equal in rank to
causality as a principle of explanation    para  although we cannot
dispense with the category of cause or the orders of space and time withinwhich it functions jung regards the relation that acauses bas in essence
statistical jung says for the primitive mind synchronicity is a selfevidentfact consequently at this stage there is no such thing as chance ibid para cassirers    study of myth as a symbolic form supports this claim
that there is no such thing as chance for mythical thought every event is theresult of divine or demonic force nothing occurs by chance or accident whatin logic is a fallacy of false cause in the sense of post hoc ergo propter hoc 
becomes in the mythical world a principle to establish cause because a particu 
lar species of bird appears repeatedly at the beginning of spring it is seen as the
bringer of spring in mythical thought so to speak anything may becom e the cause
of anything because anything may be constantly conjoined with anything
the philosopher of science henry morgenau points out that causes and
effects can be understood as a things or classes of things b events that
occur at different points in space and time or c stages in a continuous pro 
cess he says no matter how we speak of causality the principle of causalityasserts the following let aandbbe complete states of a specified system at
times t
and t tbeing earlier than t if a is realized bwill certainly follow
  pp  in other words common to all senses of causality whether
it be of physical economic historical events etc the cause precedes the effectin time what establishes one thing as the cause of another is not the simplefact of its appearance first in time causality in a scientific sense depends on a prior analysis of the world such that only certain classes of things can bemeaningfully connected to other classes of things 
synchronicity and causality do not differ simply on the ground that instances
of synchronicity are singular and unique occurrences while instances of causalconnection are repeatable or statistical scientific as well as social scientificreasoning can speak of the causes of unique events this is true of historicalevents the appearance of a new species in biology or a new heavenly body in donald phillip verene
astronomy events which can be observed only once although in such fields
we can speak of causes of such singular events the category of cause stillimplies in principle the statistical similarity of repeated events should an eventoccur similar to a given singular event it would be the subject of a similarcause thus jungs claim of cause as statistical is correct even in the case ofunique events
it is not assumed in synchronicity that the mental or psychic occurrence is
the cause of the physical occurrence to which it corresponds synchronisticoccurrences impress us because they seem to entail foresight they allow us tograsp something of importance about the present or future that is otherwisenot evident they allow the mind to accomplish something by a means itknows not what that is comparable to or even beyond its powers of causallybased prediction foresight is to synchronicity what prediction is to scientificcausality
i ching
jung regards the i ching as one of the major embodiments of the principle of
synchronicity wilhem   p xxiv the i ching  or book of changes  is the
central text of chinese culture it is perhaps the oldest book in existence itsauthorship is traditionally attributed to fu xi the legendary ruler of chinaduring the third millennium 
bcfu xi is the discoverer of the eight trigrams
upon which the work is built the work was expanded to its present form of sixtyfour trigrams by king wen the progenitor of the zhou dynasty 
bc who wrote a text for each  tuan and whose son the duke of
zhou added a comment to the lines of each of the hexagrams  gua con 
fucius   bc gave the i ching intensive study in his old age and is likely
the author of part of the commentary on the work included in the collectionknown as the ten wings  shuogua  the i ching is preconfucian predaoist
and prebuddhist but its contents have influenced these traditions and inturn elements of these traditions have become part of the overall meaning ofthe work
the i ching was originally employed as a book of divination not as a book
of contemplation but in its history it has emerged as both the method ofdivination it embodies is based on a metaphysical wisdom that itself canbecome a subject of study the elements of this metaphysics are the theoreticalbasis of its method of divination anyone can learn to perform its method ofdivination in a very short period of time like any method of divinationpractice in interpretation and grasp of its overall wisdom will allow the bookto reveal more it is a book never to be mastered in a lifetime confucius saidthat if he had more years to live he would spend them on the i ching  but what
is remarkable is how quickly the book may produce a synchronistic under 
standing for the novice the first careful and correct use of the book producesresultsjung vico and joyce 
jung consulted the book in order to write his foreword to it and much of
the foreword is a description of the result of his consultation wilhelm  
pp xxixxxxix to use the book a question is formulated and written downa bundle of fifty yarrow stalks is used the way in which the divination isconducted with the yarrow stalks displays a cosmic pattern first one stalk isremoved from the pile and set aside not to be employed further this sym 
bolizes the fundamental postulate of reality the great primal beginning of allthat exists  taiji the other fortynine stalks are divided into two groups with
a rapid motion of the right hand these symbolize yang and yin the cosmicopposites that also determine the world of human affairs to begin any sequenceof counting a single stalk is first taken from the righthand group this stalkrepresents the human being the yarrow stalks picture the universe the primalone of the taiji the opposites of yang and yin the human being the other
traditional method to consult the i ching is to toss three coins each toss
determining a line of the hexagram depending upon the configuration of headsand tails this method while authentic eliminates the cosmic symbolismpresent in the method of yarrow stalks
what occurs naturally to the mind in the examples of synchronicity men 
tioned earlier is deliberately induced by the use of the i ching  as jung puts it 
it is assumed that the fall of the coins or the result of the division of the bundle 
of yarrow stalks is what it necessarily must be in a given situation inasmuch asanything happening in that moment belongs to it as an indispensable part of thepicture
wilhelm   p xxv
the i ching has analysed all change as occurring through the opposition of
yang and yin in terms of sixtyfour situations or states of being whatever canor will happen is typified in the meaning of these sixtyfour patterns they arethe constants through which events change form through which the past hasbecome present and the present will become future once the mind is attunedto these it acquires a practical wisdom
any event set of events or situation has its own course of change to see
into the events nature in daoist terms is also to see its path its way thepractitioner may decide to act by minimal or no intervention into the courseof the events perceived this in daoist terms requires wuwei  the practice of
actionless action in which ones response to a problematic situation is not tointerfere or try to force it into a solution but to try to adapt to or slightlyadjust its natural course of change or dissolution the structure of the sixtyfour hexagrams is the structure of both the human psyche and the cosmos thei ching is a type of metaphysical knowledge or wisdom of the nature of
things that provides a basis for human action as mentioned above jungnotes that the wisdom of the i ching is the same as selfknowledge the self
apprehends its own nature in the nature of things through the interpretation of the hexagrams jung says that synchronicity is like leibnizs conception of donald phillip verene
preestablished harmony in which psychic events are coordinated with
physical events through an overall divine order para  although jung
does not point this out leibniz is in fact the one philosopher in the westerncanon to have taken a deep interest in the i ching  leibniz was fascinated not
with the divination process of the i ching  but with its mathematical structure
the sense in which its combinations could be precisely formulated in terms ofbinary arithmetic    pp 
vicos new science
the work of metaphysics in western philosophy that most illuminates the
wisdom of the i ching is giambattista vicos scienza nuova    
although vico held leibniz in high regard he knew nothing of leibnizswritings on china lach   vico does make reference to the jesuit father
martino martini a missionary to china who wrote sinicae historiae decas
prima   a work on chinese history known to leibniz which contains
probably the first depiction in a european book of the sixtyfour hexagramsof the i ching vico   para  vico was also quite aware of the import 
ance of confucius in chinese culture he compares him as a lawgiver for thechinese to zoroaster in the east the thricegreat hermes in egypt orpheusin greece and pythagoras in italy para  he regards the chinese use of
a dragon as a symbol of civil power as an example of one of the symbols deriv 
ing from what he conceived of as a mental dictionary  dizionario mentale 
paras   fu xi the legendary ruler who discovered the original
trigrams that are the basis of the i ching  found them on the shell of a horse
dragon tortoise emerging from the yellow river where he had gone tomeditate in the i ching the dragon is a symbol of the great man and the
theme of the i ching can be spoken of as the advance and retreat of the
dragon
in presenting the history of civilization in the dazhuan  the great treatise 
from the ten wings the commentary on the i ching  richard wilhelm
quotes a description of the primitive condition of human society 
in the beginning there was as yet no moral nor social order men knew their mothers
only not their fathers when hungry they searched for food when satisfied theythrew away the remnants they devoured their food hide and hair drank the bloodand clad themselves in skins and rushes
wilhelm   p 
this is close to vicos picture of the giants wandering the great forests of the
earth without families he says 
mothers abandoned their children who in time must have come to grow up without
ever hearing a human voice much less learning any human custom and thus descendedto a state truly bestial and savage  they would be quite without that fear ofgods fathers and teachers which chills and benumbs even the most exuberant injung vico and joyce 
childhood they must therefore have grown robust vigorous excessively big in
brawn and bone to the point of becoming giants
vico   para 
the dazuan continues 
then came fu xi and looked upward and contemplated the images in the heavens
and looked downward and contemplated the occurrences in earth he united manand wife regulated the five stages of change and laid down the laws of humanityhe devised the eight trigrams in order to gain mastery over the world
wilhelm   p 
in vicos account the first fathers created religion and built altars to jove
which they first experienced as thunder and began to take auspices he says 
a few giants who must have been the most robust and who were dispersed through
the forests on the mountain heights where the strongest beasts have their dens werefrightened and astonished by the great effect thunder and lightning whose causethey did not know and raised their eyes and became aware of the sky  theypictured the sky to themselves as a great animated body which in that aspect theycalled jove  who meant to tell them something by the hiss of his bolts and the clapof his thunder
vico   para  
through their fear they began both to worship jove and to form marriages 
to run into caves to hide their copulation from the sight of jove and the thunder 
oussky social order grew from these customs which include burial the third
principle of humanity religion marriage and burial burial like marriageestablished lineage and social order these customs unite opposites  life anddeath man and woman the origin stories of the great treatise and the new
science are in essence similar such conceptions of the origin of the human
world establish the principle of repetition which is required for jungsprinciple of synchronicity to have meaningful coincidence in experiencemental and physical events must repeatedly come together on their own
as the great treatise makes clear the sense of time upon which the i ching
depends is cyclical the hexagrams or ideal patterns or archetypes governparticular events that occur in cycles any event in its sheer particularity isunique but in its essence it repeats a pattern this sense of cycles is like vicosconception of ideal eternal history that is corso and ricorso  it is a provi 
dential order all in the human world is born rises to maturity and falls onlyto be born again there is a prudence implicit in this providential order inlatin providentia and prudentia are synonymous our ability to apprehend
the cycle in things gives us a practical wisdom of how to act  a prudence therenaissance florentine historian francesco guicciardini puts this as 
all that which has been in the past and is at present will be again in the future 
but both the names and the appearances of things change so that he who does not donald phillip verene
have a good eye will not recognize them nor will he know how to grasp a norm of
conduct or make a judgment by means of observation
  p  my translation 
the i ching is a method for the cultivation of the good eye the good eye is
required in order to apply jungs principle of synchronicity to events
guicciardinis good eye  buon occhio  is the renaissance power of ingenium 
the ability to see similarity in dissimilars the method of the i ching is not the
fourstep method of reasoning of descartes discourse  rather it is ingenuity
the ability to perceive a connection synchronicity is a kind of ingenuity a wayof seeing or making a connection without producing it or predicting it from acause but as jung says these interpretations of the i ching  are equivalent
to causal explanation wilhelm   p xxv vico says that ingenuity is part
of memory 
memory thus has three different aspects memory when it remembers things  memoria 
imagination  fantasia  when it alters or imitates them and ingenuity  ingegno  when
it gives them a new term or puts them into proper arrangement and relationship
  para  
for these reasons vico says memory  mnemosyne  was called the mother of
the muses the art of the muses is to sing of what was is and is to come theart of the muses is synchronistic
the i ching is among other things a memory system the use of it to answer
a question allows us to recall a pattern or patterns governing the change orevents we are trying to comprehend having recalled the proper hexagrams weinterpret them by imagining the situation as a whole in so doing we grasp theproper arrangement of the factors involved seeing what is similar in its dis 
similars the world for vico and for the i ching  and for jungs acausal prin 
ciple of synchronicity is a memory theatre in which events play out their rolesboth the practitioner of the i ching and the vichian new scientist must learn
to read the book of the world the sixtyfour hexagrams are the language orthe grammar of the language in which the book of the world is written 
this set of hexagrams corresponds to vicos mental dictionary which like
jungs archetypes of the collective unconscious contains all the basic symbolsof the worlds mythologies and the languages of the nations as they developtheir conscious memories from them vico has no specific means to tap thesemeanings other than meditation and narration on the patterns of repetitionperceivable in the great city of the human race the method of the yarrowstalks of the i ching provides the means in any situation from which medita 
tion and narration can begin to produce an interpretation and a guide to action
vicos new science of history is a doctrine of selfknowledge in history 
the self confronts its own nature in the institutions  cose of its own making
the self makes the truths of its own nature in its formations of words deedsand customs of the nations at war and in peace history is the selfs nature writjung vico and joyce 
large to find the order of history is for the self to find what it has made and
thus to find its nature as present in the meaning of its actions
in summary the parallels between the conception of the human world in the
i ching and in the new science are precise 
 the sixtyfour hexagrams comprise a perfect dictionary of the meanings of
all events that can ever occur in human experience vicos dizionario mentale
contains all the meanings possible for human experience the meaningfulstructure of any event expressed in a particular natural language can inprinciple be referred back to this common mental dictionary just as themeaning of any particular event in the teachings of the i ching can be
captured in terms of its connection to the appropriate hexagrams
 in order for this understanding of events to occur the i ching and the scienza
nuova are connected to two metaphysical principles governing human affairs
that all change occurs through opposition the hexagrams and the terms ofthe mental dictionary are the permanent factors that persist throughchange and that all events produced by the interactions of opposites arerepetitions any event has in some sense been before and will be again
 the result of these principles of oppositional change and repetition for the
human individual is a practical wisdom based on ingenium  the ability to see
similarity in dissimilars the i ching s practice of the yarrow stalks presupposes
the individuals power of ingenium to see into the dynamics of a situation
and in so doing the individual is provided with a guide to prudent action
these three points of commonality between the new science and the i ching
express principles of epistemology metaphysics and ethical action that areimplied by jungs principle of synchronicity as a principle of human psychologyfor synchronicity to occur there must be an archetypal structure that lies atthe basis of the mind in vicos terms this is the mental dictionary and in termsof the i ching it is the set of hexagrams which jung says are the instruments
by which the meaning of sixtyfour different yet typical situations can bedetermined wilhelm   p xxv in metaphysical terms the phenomenon
of synchronicity implies both the interaction of opposites  that change isdialectical  and repetition  that connections of events in the past can recuropposition and repetition are features of the real that account for the phe 
nomenal presence of synchronicity as jung examines it in human psychology 
in ethical terms of human action synchronicity is connected to the renais 
sance tradition of prudence in the example of the fire dream that illustratesjungs third type of synchronicity the experience of synchronicity leads directly to
prudent action the basis of the action taken in this case is not the result of delib 
erate or rational choice in any instance of synchronicity the individual isreoriented toward the world the i ching can induce this synchronic reorienta 
tion toward an event or a situation by its method of consultation by consultingthe new science the individual learns to be attuned to the acausal dimension
of any event because any event has its own history that mimics earlier repetitions donald phillip verene
joyces finnegans wake
literature is the province of coincidence tragedy comedy epic lyric poetry
and the novel all play upon coincidence in the world of a literary work coin 
cidence is plausible and natural we accept it as making sense within the orderof a wellwritten work or wellacted play the literary work depends upon thepower of the metaphor which depends upon the grasp of something similar inthe dissimilar as does our power of ingenuity to grasp synchronicity joycebuilt what many regard as one of the greatest literary works of the twentiethcentury finnegans wake  on the principle of coincidence of opposites that he
took from the renaissance philosopher giordano bruno and on the principleof repetitions that he took from vico joyce said that bruno held that everypower in nature must evolve an opposite in order to realize itself and opposi 
tion brings reunion etc etc bruno in lo spaccio de la bestia trionfante the
expulsion of the triumphant beast  writes the beginning the middle and
the end the birth the growth and the perfection of all that we see come fromcontraries through contraries into contraries to contraries    pp 
in finnegans wake  brunos title appears as  trionfante di bestia

asked him for advice on how to understand the instalments of finnegans
wake that were appearing in periodicals such as transition  joyce repeatedly
recommended they read vicos scienza nuova 
vico appears on the first page
of finnegans wake by his latin name vicus  and later in person as the
producer mr john baptister vickar p  references to vichian cycles
occur throughout the wake  eg teems of times and happy returns the seim
anew ordovico or viricordo p  and our wholemole millwheel 
ing vicociclometer p  to vicos three ages of gods heroes and humans
joyce adds a fourth providentiality and various formulations of this fourphase cycle occur throughout the work eg thunderburst ravishmentdissolution and providentiality p  
the i ching does not appear to be one of the books at the wake  joyce
would have known it from legges english translation done in the late  s
joyce refers to confucius using ezra pounds spelling of the name kung futze he makes reference to the confucian doctrine of the mean folkwho may not have had many momentums to master kungs doctrine of themeang p  he also has the phrase hwen ching hwan chang

fiftyninth hexagram in legges translation is transliterated as hwan  whichjung vico and joyce 
joyce urged his benefactor harriet weaver to read vicos scienza nuova to understand
finnegans wake  as he had urged her to read the odyssey to understand ulysses ellmann

read vico to understand work in progress  that became finnegans wake  suggesting that as

signifies dissolution but also success the theme of oppositions that coincide
in finnegans wake is exemplified by the opposition of the twin brothers shem
and shaun who take on many identities such as cain and abel shem andham joyce calls them yem or yan yin and yang p  joyce under 
stands contraries as being like yang and yin they are halves of each othertheir identities coincide and depend on each other in his earlier book ulysses 
joyce writes 
maeterlinck says if socrates leave his house today he will find the sage seated on his
doorstep if judas go forth tonight it is to judas his steps will tend every life is many
days day after day we walk through ourselves meeting robbers ghosts giants oldmen young men wives widows brothersinlove but always meeting ourselves
   p 
ulysses relates a day in dublin in which blooms movements about the city are
coincident with the ports of call of the voyage of odysseus the ancientrecourses itself in the modern in finnegans wake joyce carries the idea of
such connections further such that in the night world of the wake all events
are contemporary each coincides with each without the causal pattern of aplot through ingenuity the reader can come to see the similarity in dissimilarsand to see how all is a cycle within the whole cycle of the work which beginsin the middle of a sentence the beginning of which is the last line of the bookof this procedure joyces friend the french literary critic louis gillet wrote 
of course it is no longer a question of time and space in this indivisible duration
where the absolute reigns these two comrades who did their cooking for so longon the scrapiron stove of kantian categories find their pot knocked over by a kickfrom james joyce their soup is spilled out  chronology disappears and all thecenturies are contemporary
  p 
once time and space are disrupted the category of causality no longer is useful
to make sense of the words and scenes in the wake  the connections are all
acausal but held together like yang and yin as one opposition requiring itsother creating the knowledge of how all events are really about other eventsimagination becomes memory joyces work is a book of wisdom in that itcontains all that there is in human experience whoever and whatever we lookfor in it we find
joyce takes up not only vicos sense of the cycle of repetition of events but
also his conception of language and meaning as based on a mental dictionaryfinnegans wake is joyces book of the night finnegans wake is not a novel
in any ordinary sense it does not relate a story in any straightforward wayjoyce regarded it as like a dream as in a dream scenes and meanings floatabout and connect with each other without causal connection yet chaos is notthe result instead the reader is confronted with a new sense of connectionsjoyces constant play on words in every line of finnegans wake  shows the donald phillip verene
reader how all languages are recoursing the same meanings in different
phonetic and graphic shapes no word has a literal meaning in any language
and all languages coincide with each other within the totality of humanconsciousness 
it is a dream constructed by puns and word play involving more than sixty
languages most are based on the major languages of western europe butjoyce ranged as far as estonian and maori as well as to eastern languages inthe sense that all languages are connected in finnegans wake the meanings
and submeanings are all interconnected as all forms of human experience fromall cultures and all periods of history are interconnected joyce has attemptedto create a kind of prose that brings the reader into this experience of inter 
connectedness in the way that things can be connected in a dream the dreamis the night experience of everyone occurring through the main character h c earwicker who is the ancient giant finnegan as well as adam and themodern family man in one of their formulations his initials h c e meanhere comes everybody earwicker coincides with everybody else
the following passage from near the end of finnegans wake provides a
sample of joyces writing and is his summary statement of the cyclic and inter 
connected sense of things the reader not familiar with finnegans wake should
know that all the work is written in the style of this passage joyce deliberatelyplaces the reader in the position of having to make sense of what on the sur 
face offers no ordinary guidelines of grammatical structure or spelling it islike a dream the reader is placed in the position of attempting to make senseof connections and associations that are beyond common sense or literary con

joyces final question in this passage makes a joke of causality as the single
principle of connection in human experience
as a book of wisdom finnegans wake has implications for human practice
by learning to grasp the connections in it we can turn to our own present ex 
perience and approach it differently we can see past the seeming uniquenessof events before us to the eternal patterns they embody joyce changes our mindseye and in so doing we change the sense of ourselves as acting in the worldin this sense the i ching  as jung maintains as well as the new science and
finnegans wake  are works of selfknowledge in them the self encounters
itself in terms other than the temporal spatial and causal senses in which theself orders what is outside itself
conclusion
synchronicity the meaningful coincidence of events as opposed to chance
groupings requires a view of the world in which a pattern of events that hasbeen in the past can suddenly and unexpectedly repeat itself this pattern cancome to mind prior to the events actually recurring or events can coincideprompting us to recall their precedent or we may simply experience the puzzle 
ment of dj vu  jung calls synchronicity an acausal principle he approaches
this principle through his own experience the experience of his patients andhuman experience generally he also shows its presence as the fundamentalprinciple of systems of divination especially that of the i ching 
in philosophical terms jung has shown that the self encounters its own
reality through repetition and not simply through causal production in the lifeof the self events unexpectedly repeat themselves in highly significant waysthat when understood provide moments of selfknowledge not all events inour experience can be regarded as produced by causal action  b occursbecause a caused it jungs approach to the selfs experience has a place forboth the acausal principle of synchronicity and the various understandings ofcausality jungs approach attempts to comprehend all aspects of experience 
what i have called cartesian mentality would narrow our understanding of
experience for descartes what does not comply with his method for con 
ducting right reasoning in the sciences is excluded from truth and knowledgethe cartesian mentality which is a type excludes all of the selfs experiencethat cannot be causally formulated it is no accident that descartes excludeshistory fable and poetry from his model of truth in history fable and poetryliterature the self forms events not only causally but also in terms of synchron 
icity jung has shown that the i ching contains a method of synchronicity or
acausality by having reduced all experience to the fundamental patterns ofexperience in the sixtyfour hexagrams the mind can employ them in order tograsp the meaning of any specific situation in terms of repetition what occursto us naturally in instances of coincidence the i ching is able to turn into a
deliberate practice donald phillip verene
i have suggested that we may extend jungs principle of synchronicity to
exactly those fields of thought on which the cartesian mentality would turn itsback vico founds the philosophy of history on his principle of corso e ricorso 
on the sense we have that in history things do repeat themselves vico shareswith the i ching both a metaphysics of repetition  that the world does not
change but continually recasts itself  and a conception of prudence that hasa similarity to the i ching s concepts of divination vico has no yarrow stalks
but his key to prudent action is the precise grasp of the present and the futureas a repetition and modification of the past the affinity between jungs think 
ing and vicos is likely due to the fact that they share the same sources in therenaissance humanists and the ancient latins and greeks sources whichcartesian philosophy puts aside entirely

in joyces finnegans wake  for which joyce says he used vicos new science
as its trellis we find all of human experience presented acausally the self injoyces book of the dark experiences all thoughts words and things ascoincidence or as joyce says at one point cocoincidences p  joyces
use of coincidence is the extreme but it points to the fact that literature is theprovince of coincidence and synchronicity synchronicity is a principle of thefable and of the literary imagination as in history understood in vichian or similar terms in literary works we easily encounter acausal order that weaccept and in which we confront images of ourselves the philosophy of selfknowledge can turn to jung as a way to see the noncartesian side of the selfa great deal of which depends upon the selfs ability to confront in practice andin thought the presence of coincidence in human experience
