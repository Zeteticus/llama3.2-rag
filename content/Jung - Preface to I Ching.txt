i ching
foreword by carl gustav jung
since i am not a sinologue a foreword to the book of
changes from my hand must be a testimonial of my
individual experience with this great and singular book it
also affords me a welcome opportunity to pay tribute again
to the memory of my late friend richard wilhelm he
himself was profoundly aware of the cultural significance of
his translation of the i ching  a version unrivaled in the
west
if the meaning of the book of changes were easy to
grasp the work would need no foreword but this is far
from being the case for there is so much that is obscure
about it that western scholars have tended to dispose of it as
a collection of magic spells  either too abstruse to be
intelligible or of no value whatsoever legges translation
of the i ching  up to now the only version available in
english has done little to make the work accessible to
western minds wilhelm however has made every effort
to open the way to an understanding of the symbolism of the
text he was in a position to do this because he himself was
taught the philosophy and the use of the i ching  by the
venerable sage lao naihs uan moreover he had over a
period of many years put the peculiar technique of the oracle
into practice his grasp of the living meaning of the text
gives his version of the i ching a depth of perspective that
an exclusively academic knowledge of chinese philosophy
could never provide
i am greatly indebted to wilhelm for the light he has
thrown upon the complicated problem of the i ching  and
for insight as regards its practical application as well for
more than thirty years i have interested myself in this oracle
technique or method of exploring the unconscious for it
has seemed to me of uncommon significance i was already
fairly familiar with the i ching  when i first met wilhelm in
the early nineteen twenties he confirmed for me then what i
already knew and taught me many things more
i do not know chinese and have never been in china i
can assure my reader that it is not altogether easy to find the
                                                
 legge makes the following comment on the explanatory text for the
individual lines according to our notions a framer of emblems should
be a good deal of a poet but those of yi only make us think of a
dryasdust out of more than three hundred and fifty the greater numbers
are only grotesque  the sacred books of the east  xvl the yi king 
nd edn oxford clarendon press  p of the lessons of the
hexagrams the same author says but why it may be asked why
should they be conveyed to us by such an array of lineal figures and in
such a farrago of emblematic representations ibid p  however
we are nowhere told that legge ever bothered to put the method to a
practical test
right access to this monument of chinese thought which
departs so completely from our ways of thinking in order to
understand what such a book is all about it is imperative to
cast off certain prejudices of the western mind it is a
curious fact that such a gifted and intelligent people as the
chinese has never developed what we call science our
science however is based upon the principle of causality
and causality is considered to be an axiomatic truth but a
great change in our standpoint is setting in what kants
critique of pure reason failed to do is being accomplished
by modern physics the axioms of causality are being
shaken to their foundations we know now that what we
term natural laws are merely statistical truths and thus must
necessarily allow for exceptions we have not sufficiently
taken into account as yet that we need the laboratory with its
incisive restrictions in order to demonstrate the invariable
validity of natural law if we leave things to nature we see a
very different picture every process is partially or totally
interfered with by chance so much so that under natural
circumstances a course of events absolutely conforming to
specific laws is almost an exception
the chinese mind as i see it at work in the i ching 
seems to be exclusively preoccupied with the chance aspect
of events what we call coincidence seems to be the chief
concern of this peculiar mind and what we worship as
causality passes almost unnoticed we must admit that there
is something to be said for the immense importance of
chance an incalculable amount of human effort is directed
to combating and restricting the nuisance or danger
represented by chance theoretical considerations of cause
and effect often look pale and dusty in comparison to the
practical results of chance it is all very well to say that the
crystal of quartz is a hexagonal prism the statement is quite
true in so far as an ideal crystal is envisaged but in nature
one finds no two crystals exactly alike although all are
unmistakably hexagonal the actual form however seems
to appeal more to the chinese sage than the ideal one the
jumble of natural laws constituting empirical reality holds
more significance for him than a causal explanation of
events that moreover must usually be separated from one
another in order to be properly dealt with
the manner in which the i ching  tends to look upon
reality seems to disfavor our causalistic procedures the
moment under actual observation appears to the ancient
chinese view more of a chance hit than a clearly defined
result of concurring causal chain processes the matter of
interest seems to be the configuration formed by chance
events in the moment of observation and not at all the
hypothetical reasons that seemingly account for the
coincidence while the western mind carefully sifts
weighs selects classifies isolates the chinese picture of
the moment encompasses everything down to the minutest
nonsensical detail because all of the ingredients make up
the observed moment
thus it happens that when one throws the three coins or
counts through the fortynine yarrow stalks these chance
details enter into the picture of the moment of observation
and form a part of it  a part that is insiguificant to us yet
most meaningful to the chinese mind with us it would be a
banal and almost meaningless statement at least on the face
of it to say that whatever happens in a given moment
possesses inevitably the quality peculiar to that moment
this is not an abstract argument but a very practical one
there are certain connoisseurs who can tell you merely from
the appearance taste and behavior of a wine the site of its
vineyard and the year of its origin there are antiquarians
who with almost uncanny accuracy will name the time and
place of origin and the maker of an objet dart  or piece of
furniture on merely looking at it and there are even
astrologers who can tell you without any previous
knowledge of your nativity what the position of sun and
moon was and what zodiacal sign rose above the horizon in
the moment of your birth in the face of such facts it must
be admitted that moments can leave longlasting traces
in other words whoever invented the i ching  was
convinced that the hexagram worked out in a certain
moment coincided with the latter in quality no less than in
time to him the hexagram was the exponent of the moment
in which it was cast  even more so than the hours of the
clock or the divisions of the calendar could be  inasmuch as
the hexagram was understood to be an indicator of the
essential situation prevailing in the moment of its origin
this assumption involves a certain curious principle that
i have termed synchronicity a concept that formulates a
point of view diametrically opposed to that of causality
since the latter is a merely statistical truth and not absolute
it is a sort of working hypothesis of how events evolve one
out of another whereas synchronicity takes the coincidence
of events in space and time as meaning something more than
mere chance namely a peculiar interdependence of
objective events among themselves as well as with the
                                                
 cf syndironicity an acausal connecting principle the structure
and dynamics of the psyche  coll works of c g jung vol 
subjective psychic states of the observer or observers
the ancient chinese mind contemplates the cosmos in a
way comparable to that of the modern physicist who cannot
deny that his model of the world is a decidedly
psychophysical structure the microphysical event includes
the observer just as much as the reality underlying the i
ching  comprises subjective ie psychic conditions in the
totality of the momentary situation just as causality
describes the sequence of events so synchronicity to the
chinese mind deals with the coincidence of events the
causal point of view tells us a dramatic story about how d
came into existence it took its origin from c which existed
before d and c in its turn had a father b etc the
synchronistic view on the other hand tries to produce an
equally meaningful picture of coincidence how does it
happen that a b c d  etc appear all in the same
moment and in the same place it happens in the first place
because the physical events a and b are of the same quality
as the psychic events c and d and further because all are
the exponents of one and the same momentary situation the
situation is assumed to represent a legible or understandable
picture
now the sixtyfour hexagrams of the i ching  are the
instrument by which the meaning of sixtyfour different yet
typical situations can be determined these interpretations
are equivalent to causal explanations causal connection is
statistically necessary and can therefore be subjected to
experiment inasmuch as situations are unique and cannot be
repeated experimenting with synchronicity seems to be
impossible under ordinary conditions in the i ching  the
only criterion of the validity of synchronicity is the
observers opinion that the text of the hexagram amounts to
a true rendering of his psychic condition it is assumed that
the fall of the coins or the result of the division of the bundle
of yarrow stalks is what it necessarily must be in a given
situation inasmuch as anything happening in that moment
belongs to it as an indispensable part of the picture if a
handful of matches is thrown to the floor they form the
pattern characteristic of that moment but such an obvious
truth as this reveals its meaningful nature only if it is
possible to read the pattern and to verify its interpretation
partly by the observers knowledge of the subjective and
objective situation partly by the character of subsequent
events it is obviously not a procedure that appeals to a
critical mind used to experimental verification of facts or to
factual evidence but for someone who likes to look at the
world at the angle from which ancient china saw it the i
ching  may have some attraction
my argument as outlined above has of course never
entered a chinese mind on the contrary according to the
old tradition it is spiritual agencies acting in a mysterious
way that make the yarrow stalks give a meaningful answer
these powers form as it were the living soul of the book
as the latter is thus a sort of animated being the tradition
assumes that one can put questions to the i ching  and expect
to receive intelligent answers thus it occurred to me that it
might interest the uninitiated reader to see the i ching  at
                                                
 cf j b rhine the reach of the mind new york and london 
 they are shen that is spiritlike heaven produced the spiritlike
things  legge p
work for this purpose i made an experiment strictly in
accordance with the chinese conception i personified the
book in a sense asking its judgment about its present
situation ie my intention to present it to the western
mind
although this procedure is well within the premises of
taoist philosophy it appears exceedingly odd to us
however not even the strangeness of insane delusions or of
primitive superstition has ever shocked me i have always
tried to remain unbiased and curious  rerum novarum
cupidus  why not venture a dialogue with an ancient book
that purports to be animated there can be no harm in it
and the reader may watch a psychological procedure that
has been carried out time and again throughout the millennia
of chinese civilization representing to a confucius or a
laotse both a supreme expression of spiritual authority and
a philosophical enigma i made use of the coin method and
the answer obtained was hexagram  ting the
caldron
in accordance with the way my question was phrased the
text of the hexagram must be regarded as though the i ching
itself were the speaking person thus it describes itself as a
caldron that is as a ritual vessel containing cooked food
here the food is to be understood as spiritual nourishment
wilhelm says about this
the ting as a utensil pertaining to a refined
civilization suggests the fostering and
nourishing of able men which redounded to the
benefit of the state    here we see civilization
as it reaches its culmination in religion the ting
serves in offering sacrifice to god    the
supreme revelation of god appears in prophets
and holy men to venerate them is true
veneration of god the will of god as revealed
through them should he accepted in humility
keeping to our hypothesis we must conclude that the i
ching  is here testifying concerning itself
when any of the lines of a given hexagram have the
value of six or nine it means that they are specially
emphasized and hence important in the interpretation in
my hexagram the spiritual agencies have given the
emphasis of a nine to the lines in the second and in the third
place the text says
nine in the second place means
there is food in the ting
my comrades are envious
but they cannot harm me
good fortune
thus the i ching  says of itself i contain spiritual
nourishment since a share in something great always
arouses envy the chorus of the envious is part of the
picture the envious want to rob the i ching  of its great
possession that is they seek to rob it of meaning or to
destroy its meaning but their enmity is in vain its richness
of meaning is assured that is it is convinced of its positive
achievements which no one can take away the text
                                                
 see the explanation of the method in wilhelms text p
 for example the invidi  the envious are a constantly recurring
image in the old latin books on alchemy especially in the turba
philosophorum  eleventh or twelfth century
continues
nine in the third place means
the handle of the ting is altered
one is impeded in his way of life
the fat of the pheasant is not eaten
once rain falls remorse is spent
good fortune comes in the end
the handle german griff  is the part by which the ting
can be grasped  gegriffen  thus it signifies the concept
begriff  one has of the i ching  the ting in the course of
time this concept has apparently changed so that today we
can no longer grasp  begreifen  the i ching  thus one is
impeded in his way of life we are no longer supported by
the wise counsel and deep insight of the oracle therefore we
no longer find our way through the mazes of fate and the
obscurities of our own natures the fat of the pheasant that
is the best and richest part of a good dish is no longer
eaten but when the thirsty earth finally receives rain again
that is when this state of want has been overcome
remorse that is sorrow over the loss of wisdom is ended
and then comes the longedfor opportunity wilhelm
comments this describes a man who in a highly evolved
civilization finds himself in a place where no one notices or
recognizes him this is a severe block to his effectiveness
the i ching  is complaining as it were that its excellent
qualities go unrecognized and hence lie fallow it comforts
                                                
 from the latin concipere  ito take together eg in a vessel
concipere  derives from capere to take to grasp
itself with the hope that it is about to regain recognition
the answer given in these two salient lines to the
question i put to the i ching  requires no particular subtlety
of interpretation no artifices no unusual knowledge
anyone with a little common sense can understand the
meaning of the answer it is the answer of one who has a
good opinion of himself but whose value is neither
generally recognized nor even widely known the
answering subject has an interesting notion of itself it looks
upon itself as a vessel in which sacrificial offerings are
brought to the gods ritual food for their nourishment it
conceives of itself as a cult utensil serving to provide
spiritual nourishment for the unconscious elements or forces
spiritual agencies that have been projected as gods  in
other words to give these forces the attention they need in
order to play their part in the life of the individual indeed
this is the original meaning of the word religio   a careful
observation and taking account of from relegere the
numinous
the method of the i ching does indeed take into account
the hidden individual quality in things and men and in ones
own unconscious self as well i have questioned the i ching
as one questions a person whom one is about to introduce to
friends one asks whether or not it will be agreeable to him
in answer the i ching  tells me of its religious significance
of the fact that at present it is unknown and misjudged of its
hope of being restored to a place of honor  this last
obviously with a sidelong glance at my as yet unwritten
                                                
 this is the classical etymology the derivation of rehgio  from religare 
bind to originated with the church fathers
foreword and above all at the english translation this
seems a perfectly understandable reaction such as one could
expect also from a person in a similar situation
but how has this reaction come about because i threw
three small coins into the air and let them fall roll and
come to rest heads up or tails up as the case might be this
odd fact that a reaction that makes sense arises out of a
technique seemingly excluding all sense from the outset is
the great achievement of the i ching  the instance i have
just given is not unique meaningful answers are the rule
western sinologues and distinguished chinese scholars have
been at pains to inform me that the i ching  is a collection of
obsolete magic spells in the course of these conversations
my informant has sometimes admitted having consulted the
oracle through a fortune teller usually a taoist priest this
could be only nonsense of course but oddly enough the
answer received apparently coincided with the questioners
psychological blind spot remarkably well
i agree with western thinking that any number of
answers to my question were possible and i certainly cannot
assert that another answer would not have been equally
significant however the answer received was the first and
only one we know nothing of other possible answers it
pleased and satisfied me to ask the same question a second
time would have been tactless and so i did not do it the
master speaks but once the heavyhanded pedagogic
approach that attempts to fit irrational phenomena into a
preconceived rational pattern is anathema to me indeed
such things as this answer should remain as they were when
                                                
 i made this experiment before i actually wrote the foreword
they first emerged to view for only then do we know what
nature does when left to herself undisturbed by the
meddlesomeness of man one ought not to go to cadavers to
study life moreover a repetition of the experiment is
impossible for the simple reason that the original situation
cannot be reconstructed therefore in each instance there is
only a first and single answer
to return to the hexagram itself there is nothing strange
in the fact that all of ting the caldron amplifies the
themes announced by the two salient lines the first line of
the hexagram says
a ting with legs upturned
furthers removal of stagnating stuff
one takes a concubine
for the sake of her son
no blame
a ting that is turned upside down is not in use hence the
i ching  is like an unused caldron turning it over serves to
remove stagnating matter as the line says just as a man
takes a concubine when his wife has no son so the i ching
is called upon when one sees no other way out despite the
quasilegal status of the concubine in china she is in reality
only a somewhat awkward makeshift so likewise the magic
procedure of the oracle is an expedient that may be utilized
for a higher purpose there is no blame although it is an
exceptional recourse
                                                
 the chinese interpret only the changing lines in the hexagram
obtained by use of the oracle i have found all the lines of the hexagram
to be relevant in most cases
the second and third lines have already been discussed
the fourth line says
the legs of the ting are broken
the princes meal is spilled
and his person is soiled
misfortune
here the ting has been put to use but evidently in a very
clumsy manner that is the oracle has been abused or
misinterpreted in this way the divine food is lost and one
puts oneself to shame legge translates as follows its
subject will be made to blush for shame abuse of a cult
utensil such as the ting ie the i ching  is a gross
profanation the i ching  is evidently insisting here on its
dignity as a ritual vessel and protesting against being
profanely used
the fifth line says
the ting has yellow handles
golden carrying rings
perseverance furthers
the i ching  has it seems met with a new correct
yellow understanding that is a new concept  begriff  by
which it can be grasped this concept is valuable golden
there is indeed a new edition in english making the book
more accessible to the western world than before
the sixth line says
the ting has rings of jade
great good fortune
nothing that would not act to further
jade is distinguished for its beauty and soft sheen if the
carrying rings are of jade the whole vessel is enhanced in
beauty honor and value the i ching  expresses itself here
as being not only well satisfied but indeed very optimistic
one can only await further events and in the meantime
remain content with the pleasant conclusion that the i ching
approves of the new edition
i have shown in this example as objectively as i can how
the oracle proceeds in a given case of course the procedure
varies somewhat according to the way the question is put if
for instance a person finds himself in a confusing situation
he may himself appear in the oracle as the speaker or if the
question concerns a relationship with another person that
person may appear as the speaker however the identity of
the speaker does not depend entirely on the manner in which
the question is phrased inasmuch as our relations with our
fellow beings are not always determined by the latter very
often our relations depend almost exclusively on our own
attitudes though we maybe quite unaware of this fact
hence if an individual is unconscious of his role in a
relationship there may be a surprise in store for him
contrary to expectation he himself may appear as the chief
agent as is sometimes unmistakably indicated by the text it
may also occur that we take a situation too seriously and
consider it extremely important whereas the answer we get
on consulting the i ching  draws attention to some
unsuspected other aspect impllcit in the question
such instances might at first lead one to think that the
oracle is fallacious confucius is said to have received only
one inappropriate answer ie hexagram  grace  a
thoroughly aesthetic hexagram this is reminiscent of the
advice given to socrates by his daemon  you ought to
make more music  whereupon socrates took to playing the
flute confucius and socrates compete for first place as far
as reasonableness and a pedagogic attitude to life are
concerned but it is unlikely that either of them occupied
himself with lending grace to the beard on his chin as the
second line of this hexagram advises unfortunately reason
and pedagogy often lack charm and grace and so the oracle
may not have been wrong after all
to come back once more to our hexagram though the i
ching  not only seems to be satisfied with its new edition
but even expresses emphatic optimism this still does not
foretell anything about the effect it will have on the public it
is intended to reach since we have in our hexagram two
yang lines stressed by the numerical value nine we are in a
position to find out what sort of prognosis the i ching
makes for itself lines designated by a six or a nine have
according to the ancient conception an inner tension so
great as to cause them to change into their opposites that is
yang into yin and vice versa through this change we
obtain in the present instance hexagram  chin
progress
the subject of this hexagram is someone who meets with
all sorts of vicissitudes of fortune in his climb upward and
the text describes how he should hehave the i ching is in
this same situation it rises like the sun and declares itself
but it is rebuffed and finds no confidence  it is
progressing but in sorrow however one obtains great
happiness from ones ancestress psychology can help us to
elucidate this obscure passage in dreams and fairy tales the
grandmother or ancestress often represents the uncon
scious because the latter in a man contains the feminine
component of the psyche if the i ching  is not accepted by
the conscious at least the unconscious meets it halfway and
the i ching  is more closely connected with the unconscious
than with the rational attitude of consciousness since the
unconscious is often represented in dreams by a feminine
figure this may be the explanation here the feminine
person might be the translator who has given the book her
maternal care and this might easily appear to the i ching  as
a great happiness it anticipates general understantling but
is afraid of misuse  progress like a hamster but it is
mindful of the admonition take not gain and loss to
heart it remains free of partisan motives it does not
thrust itself on anyone
the i ching  therefore faces its future on the american
book market calmly and expresses itself here just about as
any reasonable person would in regard to the fate of so
controversial a work this prediction is so very reasonable
and full of common sense that it would be hard to think of a
more fitting answer
all of this happened before i had written the foregoing
paragraphs when i reached this point i wished to know the
attitude of the i ching  to the new situation the state of
things had been altered by what i had written inasmuch as i
myself had now entered upon the scene and i therefore
expected to hear something referring to my own action i
must confess that i had not been feeling too happy in the
course of writing this foreword for as a person with a sense
of responsibility toward science i am not in the habit of
asserting something i cannot prove or at least present as
acceptable to reason it is a dubious task indeed to try to
introduce to a critical modern public a collection of archaic
magic spells with the idea of making them more or less
acceptable i have undertaken it because i myself think that
there is more to the ancient chinese way of thinking than
meets the eye but it is embarrassing to me that i must
appeal to the good will and imagination of the reader
inasmuch as i have to take him into the obscurity of an age
old magic ritual unfortunately i am only too well aware of
the arguments that can be brought against it we are not
even certain that the ship that is to carry us over the
unknown seas has not sprung a leak somewhere may not
the old text be corrupt is wilhelms translation accurate
are we not selfdeluded in our explanations
the i ching  insists upon selfknowledge throughout the
method by which this is to be achieved is open to every kind
of misuse and is therefore not for the frivolousminded and
immature nor is it for intellectualists and rationalists it is
appropriate only for thoughtful and reflective people who
like to think about what they do and what happens to them 
a predilection not to be confused with the morbid brooding
of the hypochondriac as i have indicated above i have no
answer to the multitude of problems that arise when we seek
to harmonize the oracle of the i ching  with our accepted
scientific canons but needless to say nothing occult is to
be inferred my position in these matters is pragmatic and
the great disciplines that have taught me the practical
usefulness of this viewpoint are psychotherapy and medical
psychology probably in no other field do we have to reckon
with so many unknown quantities and nowhere else do we
become more accustomed to adopting methods that work
even though for a long time we may not know why they
work unexpected cures may arise from questionable the
rapies and unexpected failures from allegedly reliable
methods in the exploration of the unconscious we come
upon very strange things from which a rationalist turns
away with horror claiming afterward that he did not see
anything the irrational fullness of life has taught me never
to discard anything even when it goes against all our
theories so shortlived at best or otherwise admits of no
immediate explanation it is of course disquieting and one
is not certain whether the compass is pointing true or not
but security certitude and peace do not lead to discoveries
it is the same with this chinese mode of divination clearly
the method aims at selfknowledge though at all times it has
also been put to superstitious use
i of course am thoroughly convinced of the value of self
knowledge but is there any use in recommending such
insight when the wisest of men throughout the ages have
preached the need of it without success even to the most
biased eye it is obvious that this book represents one long
admonition to careful scrutiny of ones own character
attitude and motives this attitude appeals to me and has
induced me to undertake the foreword only once before
have i expressed myself in regard to the problem of the i
ching  this was in a memorial address in tribute to richard
willielm for the rest i have maintained a discreet silence
                                                
 cf r wilhelm and c g jung the secret of the golden flower  tr
gary f baynes london and new york  new edn revised 
in which this address appears as an appendix the book did not appear
it is by no means easy to feel ones way into such a remote
and mysterious mentality as that underlying the i ching 
one cannot easily disregard such great minds as confucius
and laotse if one is at all able to appreciate the quality of
the thoughts they represent much less can one overlook the
fact that the i ching  was their main source of inspiration i
know that previously i would not have dared to express
myself so explicitly about so uncertain a matter i can take
this risk because i am now in my eighth decade and the
changing opinions of men scarcely impress me any more
the thoughts of the old masters are of greater value to me
than the philosophical prejudices of the western mind
i do not like to burden my reader with these personal
considerations but as already indicated ones own
personality is very often implicated in the answer of the
oracle indeed in formulating my question i even invited the
oracle to comment directly on my action the answer was
hexagram  kan the abysmal special emphasis is
given to the third place by the fact that the line is designated
by a six this line says
forward and backward abyss on abyss
in danger like this pause at first and wait
otherwise you will fall into a pit in the abyss
do not act in this way
formerly i would have accepted unconditionally the
advice do not act in this way and would have refused to
give my opinion of the i ching  for the sole reason that i had
                                                                                                  
in english until a year after wilhelms death the address is also in the
spirit in man art and literature  coll works of c g jung vol
none but now the counsel may serve as an example of the
way in which the i ching  functions it is a fact that if one
begins to think about it the problems of the i ching  do
represent abyss on abyss and unavoidably one must
pause at first and wait in the midst of the dangers of
limitless and uncritical speculation otherwise one really
will lose his way in the darkness could there be a more
uncomfortable position intellectually than that of floating in
the thin air of unproved possibilities not knowing whether
what one sees is truth or illusion this is the dreamlike
atmosphere of the i ching  and in it one has nothing to rely
upon except ones own so fallible subjective judgment i
cannot but admit that this line represents very appropriately
the feelings with which i wrote the foregoing passages
equally fitting is the comforting beginning of this hexagram
 if you are sincere you have success in your heart  for it
indicates that the decisive thing here is not the outer danger
but the subjective condition that is whether one believes
oneself to be sincere or not
the hexagram compares the dynamic action in this
situation to the behavior of flowing water which is not
afraid of any dangerous place but plunges over cliffs and
fills up the pits that lie in its course kan also stands for
water this is the way in which the superior man acts and
carries on the business of teaching
kan is definitely one of the less agreeable hexagrams it
describes a situation in which the subject seems in grave
danger of being caught in all sorts of pitfalls just as in
interpreting a dream one must follow the dream text with
utmost exactitude so in consulting the oracle one must hold
in mind the form of the question put for this sets a definite
limit to the interpretation of the answer the first line of the
hexagram notes the presence of the danger in the abyss
one falls into a pit the second line does the same then
adds the counsel one should strive to attain small things
only i apparently anticipated this advice by limiting myself
in this foreword to a demonstration of how the i ching
functions in the chinese mind and by renouncing the more
ambitious project of writing a psychological commentary on
the whole book
the fourth line says
a jug of wine a bowl of rice with it
earthen vessels
simply handed in through the window
there is certainly no blame in this
wilhelm makes the following comment here
although as a rule it is customary for an official
to present certain introductory gifts and reco
mmendations before he is appointed here everything
is simplified to the utmost the gifts are
insignificant there is no one to sponsor him he
introduces himself yet all this need not be
humiliating if only there is the honest intention of
mutual help in danger

it looks as if the book were to some degree the subject of
this line
the fifth line continues the theme of limitation if one
studies the nature of water one sees that it fills a pit only to
the rim and then flows on it does not stay caught there
the abyss is not filled to overflowing
it is filled only to the rim
but if tempted by the danger and just because of the
uncertainty one were to insist on forcing conviction by
special efforts such as elaborate commentaries and the like
one would only be mired in the difficulty which the top line
describes very accurately as a tiedup and cagedin
condition indeed the last line often shows the conse
quences that result when one does not take the meaning of
the hexagram to heart
in our hexagram we have a six in the third place this yin
line of mounting tension changes into a yang line and thus
produces a new hexagram showing a new possibility or
tendency we now have hexagram  ching the well
the water hole no longer means danger however but rather
something beneficial a well
thus the superior man encourages
the people at their work
and exhorts them to help one another
the image of people helping one another would seem to
refer to the reconstruction of the well for it is broken down
and full of mud not even animals drink from it there are
fishes living in it and one can shoot these but the well is
not used for drinking that is for human needs this
description is reminiscent of the overturned and unused ting
that is to receive a new handle moreover this well like the
ting is cleaned but no one drinks from it
this is my hearts sorrow
for one might draw from it
the dangerous water hole or abyss pointed to the i
ching  and so does the well but the latter has a positive
meaning it contains the waters of life it should he restored
to use but one has no concept  begriff  of it no utensil with
which to carry the water the jug is broken and leaks the
ting needs new handles and carrying rings by which to grasp
it and so also the well must be newly lined for it contains
a clear cold spring from which one can drink one may
draw water from it because it is dependable
it is clear that in this prognosis the speaking subject is
again the i ching  representing itself as a spring of living
water the preceding hexagram described in detail the
danger confronting the person who accidentally falls into the
pit within the abyss he must work his way out of it in
order to discover that it is an old ruined well buried in
mud but capable of being restored to use again
i submitted two questions to the method of chance
represented by the coin oracle the second question being
put after i had written my analysis of the answer to the first
the first question was directed as it were to the i ching 
what had it to say about my intention to write a foreword
the second question concerned my own action or rather the
situation in which i was the acting subject who had
discussed the first hexagram to the first question the i
ching  replied by comparing itself to a caldron a ritual
vessel in need of renovation a vessel that was finding only
doubtful favor with the public to the second question the
reply was that i had fallen into a difficulty for the i ching
represented a deep and dangerous water hole in which one
might easily be mired however the water hole proved to be
an old well that needed only to be renovated in order to be
put to useful purposes once more
these four hexagrams are in the main consistent as
regards theme vessel pit well and as regards intellectual
content they seem to be meaningful had a human being
made such replies i should as a psychiatrist have had to
pronounce him of sound mind at least on the basis of the
material presented indeed i should not have been able to
discover anything delirious idiotic or schizophrenic in the
four answers in view of the i ching s extreme age and its
chinese origin i cannot consider its archaic symbolic and
flowery language abnormal on the contrary i should have
had to congratulate this hypothetical person on the extent of
his insight into my unexpressed state of doubt on the other
hand any person of clever and versatile mind can turn the
whole thing around and show how i have projected my
subjective contents into the symbolism of the hexagrams
such a critique though catastrophic from the standpoint of
western rationality does no harm to the function of the i
ching  on the contrary the chinese sage would smilingly
tell me dont you see how useful the i ching  is in making
you project your hitherto unrealized thoughts into its
abstruse symbolism you could have written your foreword
without ever realizing what an avalanche of misun
derstanding might be released by it
the chinese standpoint does not concern itself as to the
attitude one takes toward the performance of the oracle it is
only we who are puzzled because we trip time and again
over our prejudice viz the notion of causality the ancient
wisdom of the east lays stress upon the fact that the
intelligent individual realizes his own thoughts but not in
the least upon the way in which he does it the less one
thinks about the theory of the i ching  the more soundly one
sleeps
it would seem to me that on the basis of this example an
unprejudiced reader would now be in a position to form at
least a tentative judgment on the operation of the i ching 
more cannot be expected from a simple introduction if by
means of this demonstration i have succeeded in elucidating
the psychological phenomenology of the i ching  i shall
have carried out my purpose as to the thousands of
questions doubts and criticisms that this singular book stirs
up  i cannot answer these the i ching  does not offer itself
with proofs and results it does not vaunt itself nor is it easy
to approach like a part of nature it waits until it is
discovered it offers neither facts nor power but for lovers
of selfknowledge of wisdom  if there be such  it seems to
be the right book to one person its spirit appears as clear as
day to another shadowy as twilight to a third dark as
                                                
 the reader will find it helpful to look up all four of these
hexagrams in the text and to read them together wi th the relevant
cormmentaries
night he who is not pleased by it does not have to use it
and he who is against it is not obliged to find it true let it
go forth into the world for the benefit of those who can
discern its meaning
